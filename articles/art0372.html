<p>Foreword by <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>. News story selection by Amara Angelica and Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>. Originally published on KurzweilAI.net January 3, 2002.</p>
<p>When I introduced <i>The </i><i>Age of Spiritual Machines</i><i>, When Computers Exceed </i><i>Human</i><i> </i><i>Intelligence</i> (Viking) in January of 1999, my primary thesis that computers would achieve both the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> within thirty years and that an intimate merger with these technologies would greatly amplify the powers of our human-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> was considered a radical notion. Now, three years later, there has been a sea change in informed public <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>, as anticipation of a transbiological era has moved far closer to the mainstream. A major <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this transformation in understanding is the torrent of notable news stories that support and move forward the foundation of this thesis.</p>
<p>On February 22 of 2001, we introduced <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613233303/http://www.kurzweilai.net/" target="_new">KurzweilAI.net</a>. Although "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>" connotes the field of "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>," we mean it in the larger <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of "accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>," which are the multifarious threads that are advancing our understanding and mastery of what I regard as the most powerful force in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, namely <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Ultimately I believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will prove to be a more powerful force in determining our destiny than those vast cosmological forces.</p>
<p>One of our primary purposes in launching KurzweilAI.net was to document the flow of new developments that are moving us toward a singular point in human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, indeed to what is increasingly becoming known as the "<a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>." We set a high bar to post a news story on the site. It had to represent a significant step forward in one of the important underlying threads in our advance toward the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>: continued <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies, comparable acceleration in efforts to reverse-engineer (i.e., understand the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of) the human brain and other sources of the templates of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, similar <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in our understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes, and the ripples of impact all of these developments are having on our economic and social lives.</p>
<p>Despite the high bar we set, even we were surprised at how many advances and breakthroughs made the cut. As of yearend, we posted 724 news stories since our launch on February 22. We offer here some of the highlights.</p>
<p>There were many stories that provide strong support of the expectation that computational resources will continue their now more than one-century-long period of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, both through and beyond Moore's Law. In particular, there were genuine breakthroughs in the important area of molecular electronics, with multiple methodologies demonstrating the feasibility of computing in three dimensions, and at the molecular, or even atomic level. For example, scientists at Harvard University have grown tiny nanowires--crystal rods of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> and other semiconductors to form rudimentary circuits that perform basic logic operations--Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed genetically engineered <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> that function like microchip components, and <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">Semiconductor</a> engineers made 3-D circuits by coating standard <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> wafers with many successive layers of polysilicon.</p>
<p>Included among these developments was intriguing <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in harnessing the perplexing powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, which promises to be able to test every combination of values of multiple "qubits," ambiguous bits that code zero and one simultaneously, thereby instantly searching vast spaces of possible solutions to problems. For example, scientists at the <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> Almaden <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Center have recently performed the most complex such calculation yet: factoring the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 15. And researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara have used 10<sup>-13</sup> second pulses of laser light to "tip" the quantum spin alignment of electrons.</p>
<p>Closely related to molecular and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, the ability to manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> atoms to create virtually any physical <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>.  Nano-engineered entities provide the opportunity to combine extremely tiny structural elements, mechanical components, and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.  <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> has an important role in the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in that the next era after two-dimensional semiconductors (i.e., Moore's Law) will be three-dimensional molecular devices built using principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.  For example, scientists from Lucent <a class="thought" href="entries/bell_labs_entry.html">Bell Labs</a> have fabricated an individually addressable <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> whose channel consists of just one <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> and Georgia Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> researchers have created "nanobelts" that could lead to inexpensive ultra-small sensors, flat-panel display components and other <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> nanodevices.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> also has a critical role in the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in that nanobots (robots built using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>) traveling through the bloodstream will ultimately provide us with close up views of the brain's circuitry and electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes. For example, a University of Illinois at Chicago researcher has created a nano-scale injectable capsule for treating diabetes in rats that is big enough to let the insulin out, but small enough to keep antibodies from entering.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will also provide us with means of providing intimate connection between <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and along these lines, there were several engaging developments in 2001. For example, scientists at <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> Institute have created the world's first living <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> by coating a chip with a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> and adding snail neurons, while scientists at the University of Texas are using a sliver of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> to connect neurons and tiny crystals of semiconductors called quantum dots, which could be used in <a class="thought" href="entries/prosthetics_entry.html">prosthetics</a> operated directly by a user's nerve impulses and in sensors that detect tiny quantities of neurotoxins.</p>
<p>One of the profound implications of combining <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> systems will be the increasing realism of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. Ultimately, we'll be able to do anything with anyone (or a very good simulation of anyone) in compelling <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments. There were major strides in this area as well. For example, new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> allows filmmakers to add synthespians (virtual actors) with realistic hair, clothing, skin and muscles to make them indistinquishable from real people and new videoconferencing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> such as Teleportec creates the illusion that you're in the same physical space as other people, who might be thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>There was also significant <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the brain <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> in 2001. For example, researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas have discovered a biochemical pathway that helps describe how neurons in the brain and spinal cord form their connections and could lead to discoveries in nerve regrowth and regeneration. And <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a> continued to develop his model of the human auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>'s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613233303/http://www.lloydwatts.com/cochlea.shtml" target="_new">computations</a> in the auditory pathway.</p>
<p>Perhaps the area with the most immediate impact is the merger of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, and there were several breakthroughs in 2001 regarding the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, therapeutic cloning, and related areas. For example, draft sequences of the entire human <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> led to the surprising discovery that the human gene count was low--only 35,000 genes--and alternatives to controversial human embryonic stem cells were explored for creating tissue needed to repair damaged organs.</p><h1>Continued <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential Growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a></h1><h2>Nanowires May Lead to Superfast <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Chips</h2><p>

<i>Reuters</i>, November 26, 2001</p>
<p>Intel Corp. has devised a new <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> for transistors--the TeraHertz <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>--that it said could lead to microprocessors that run at blazing speeds and consume far less power than conventional ones. This could be another step in extending <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a> into the next decade.</p>
<p>The new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> solves a fundamental problem--leakage of electrical current within a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>--that has emerged with super-speedy transistors with dialectrics only about three atomic layers thick.</p>
<p>"What's going to limit <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> performance is the power consumption, not the speed and not the size," said Gerald Marcyk, director of components <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in Intel's <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and manufacturing group. He added that Intel is aiming to have 25 times more transistors in processors than in current ones, running at 10 times the speed, yet with no increase in power.</p><h2>Smart <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a></h2><p>

<p>Using the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> itself as a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, researchers have solved a mathematical problem with the unwitting assistance of machines in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The Notre Dame team exploited the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> transmission control protocol (TCP). The TCP ensures accurate <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, using a "checksum"--a mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> performed by sender and receiver. The two computers compare answers--if they differ, data has been corrupted in transit and they try again.</p>
<p>The researchers replaced the checksum (sent by their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) with a potential solution to the problem they were trying to solve. They posted all the possible solutions to servers around the world. Each host sent only valid answers back to the parasite. Otherwise, it dropped the message.</p>

Almaden <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Center announced that they have performed the most complex such calculation yet: factoring the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 15.</p>
<p>The scientists performed the calculation by manipulating single atoms, showing that the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>'s multiple steps could be carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>If this kind of quantum parallelism can be extended to a larger scale, numbers hundreds of digits long could be factored with ease. Since many <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> schemes assume the near impossibility of factoring large numbers, a working quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would potentially put much of the world's most secret <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in jeopardy.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, Dr. Chuang (now with MIT) and his colleagues used a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> consisting primarily of fluorine and <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms. A vial of liquid containing quadrillions of the molecules was placed inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> spectrometer. By bombarding the molecules with a precise sequence of <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> pulses, the experimenters flipped the atoms back and forth between 1 and 0.</p>
<p>Although the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 15 is not a large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, published in the journal <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a>, demonstrates the practical implementation of a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p><h2>Computing, One <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">Atom</a> at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a></h2><p>

<p>Researchers are using chip lithography to "microprint" furrows that growing brain cells will follow, with the potential of creating "designer" biosensors, implants and <a class="thought" href="entries/prosthetics_entry.html">prosthetics</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Bruce Wheeler of Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, prints a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> on a <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> using lithography in a manner similar to the way signal paths are laid down on chips.

<p>Glass surfaces on which live nerve cells can grow and wire themselves to electrodes may help scientists to develop better implants, <a class="thought" href="entries/prosthetics_entry.html">prosthetics</a> and biosensors.</p>
<p>University of Illinois researchers led by Bruce Wheeler harvested brain cells from developing rat embryos and separated them both chemically and mechanically.</p>
<p>Using a lithographic <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> called microstamping, they then printed a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> on the surface of a petri dish in polylysine, an artificial polymer used for cell cultures. "The microstamp works the same as a conventional rubber stamp except that the ink is polylysine and the patterns produced are measured in micrometers, or the same size as the cells themselves," Bruce Wheeler says.</p>
<p>The scientists then poured the brain cells onto the patterned surface, where the cells attached to the artificial polymer. "Within a few days, the cells send out processes that explore the environment, preferring areas that have intact polylysine," Wheeler notes.

</p>
<p>New York Times, December 18, 2001</p>
<p>Alternatives to controversial human embryonic stem cells are being explored for creating tissue needed to repair damaged organs.</p>
<p>Possibilities include:</p>
<p>&#183; Adult stems cells are rare, hard to isolate and purify, hard to grow in culture, and may not exist for all tissues. Some success has been achieved with umbilical cord blood and fat sources.</p>
<p>&#183; Other cells are created from various sources, such as human embryos (by Anthrogenesis Corporation, which has isolated stem cells from human placentas), foreskins from circumcisions for making artificial skin for wound repair, and neurons obtained from pig fetuses by Diacrin as a treatment for people with brain diseases like Parkinson's.</p>
<p>&#183; Drugs would activate the body's own stem cells to let the body repair itself. For example, the human <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> erythropoietin, when injected, prompts the body to create new red blood cells. However, tissue <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> requires not just one <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> factor but a carefully orchestrated combination of them. Duplicating that with drugs may be difficult.</p>
<p>&#183; Parthenogenesis (in certain <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, eggs can turn into embryos without being fertilized by sperm). Some scientists are trying to use chemicals to turn unfertilized human eggs into embryos from which stem cells can be extracted. Such embryos ("parthenotes") could never become babies, so destruction of them to make stem cells may not raise the same moral issues as destruction of embryos. Since tissue derived from parthenotes would be very similar to that of the egg donor, a woman might donate her own eggs to make tissue for herself that her body would not reject.</p>
<p>&#183; De-differentiation (cellular reprogramming) aims at getting specialized body cells to revert to a primordial state, like stem cells, so they can be turned into various types of tissues. PPL Therapeutics, which cloned Dolly the sheep, is pioneering <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> techniques in this area.</p>
<p>&#183; Transdifferentiation aims to turn a cell back to its primordial state in order to turn that primordial cell into another type of cell. Hematech has successfully reprogrammed the nuclei of fibroblasts, which are cells that produce the body's connective tissue.</p><h2>Tiny Capsules Float Downstream</h2><p>

Using the latest molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> techniques to home in on <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>'s genetic roots, doctors are starting to halt precancerous growths before tumors ever develop and to target cancers that have already started to grow with a precision unimaginable just a decade ago.</p>
<p>Some of the new approaches:</p>
<p>&#183; Gleevec shows promise against an uncommon digestive tract <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> called gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Tests of the drug are also underway in patients with lung, prostate and brain cancers.</p>
<p>&#183; A genetically engineered mouthwash is being tested against pre-cancerous growths that often precede oral <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>. The treatment targets a faulty p53 gene, known as a tumor suppressor.</p>
<p>&#183; Researchers are reporting early success with genetically engineered vaccines that activate the patient's own <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> to attack and destroy tumors.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Howdy from Texas!
<br>
<br>
I would like to thank you for creating a knowledge base for people who take an interest in Artificial Intelligence and the advances toward the Singularity.  I am an avid fan of Dr. Kurzweil and have recommended "The Age of Spiritual Machines" to many of my friends. I feel this book demonstrates the importance of the field of A.I. to mankind. Your article reminds me of the advances that are being made while most of us are sitting on our butts watching technology pass us by. Thanks for the continuing effort you are making to educate the rest of the world. I was curious about the possibility of obtaining an unabridged copy of all the articles that have appeared on KurzweilAI.net since it's inception.  I have found your articles to be of significant importance and have found myself saving them and using up a lot of hard drive space to do it.  It would be great to have all the articles on a CD. You guys might even make a little money to help support the cause. Of course, it would be nice to receive a free CD for making the suggestion!  Keep up the great work and thanks for providing me with a crystal ball focused on technology.
<br>
<br>
