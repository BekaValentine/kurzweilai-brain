<h2>Measurement Without Observation </h2>
<p></p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a>&#8217;s articulated world, there is no such thing 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, a view he makes clear in his <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist view 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. Ray states that &#8220;it is the act of measurement 
              that causes the collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function, not conscious observation 
              of the measurement.&#8221; In other words, according to Ray, the 
              collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function is caused by measurement without observation, 
              but what could this refer to? We know that any quantum &#8220;collapsed&#8221; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> involving one or more <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s causes some reaction beyond 
              those <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s immediately involved. No <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> is an &#8220;island,&#8221; 
              so to speak. These inevitable reactions are properly considered 
              measurements. The only conceivable circumstance in which an <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> 
              would not cause a specific reaction (i.e., a measurement) is if 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> was indeterminate because the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function was not collapsed. 
              It is only through the collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function that an <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> 
              becomes determinate and thereby causes a reaction in the world, 
              which constitutes a measurement. It is, therefore, the collapse 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function that causes measurement, which Ray tells us 
              causes collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function. So what Ray is saying is that 
              the collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function causes the collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> 
              function. By removing the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of observation from measurement, 
              Ray&#8217;s explanation of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> devolves into this tautology.</p>
<p>Ray goes on to call any other view, even those of other mainstream 
              scientists, a &#8220;glaring&#8230;error.&#8221; Ray&#8217;s rigid view 
              regards any introduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> in the world to be an 
              &#8220;error.&#8221; I would also point out that if we accept Ray&#8217;s 
              view, then Penrose&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion to the potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> (i.e., Penrose&#8217;s argument to the 
              effect that such an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> would have to recreate the precise quantum 
              state of a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>) becomes even less valid. 
            </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Colloquial <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">Chaos</a> Indeed</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Ray casts doubt that there is increased <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> as an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> moves 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion as a single <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> to a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>. Consider 
              what we know about this process. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> contains 3 billion 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> rungs for a total of 6 billion bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. There is enormous 
              redundancy in this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (e.g., a sequence known as &#8220;ALU&#8221; 
              is repeated hundreds of thousands of times), so the amount of unique 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is estimated at around 3% or about 23 megabytes. In 
              contrast, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> contains on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 100 trillion 
              connections. Just specifying this connection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> would require 
              trillions of bytes. Thus as we go from the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, which specifies 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> among all other organs, to the fully expressed <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>, 
              the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, considering just the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> connection 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s alone, increases by a factor of millions. We know that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> specifies a wiring plan for the interneuronal connections 
              that includes a great deal of randomness, i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, at specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation stages. This includes the stage of fetal wiring, 
              during which interneuronal connections essentially wire themselves 
              with a significant <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> of randomness applied during the process, 
              as well as the growing of new dendrites after birth (which is believed 
              to be a critical part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process). This is at least 
              one source of the increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> resulting from the development 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> from a fertilized egg. Another source is the <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> 
              inherent in the environment that the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> encounters. </p>
<p>Ray states that I argue that &#8220;increasing rates of mutations 
              and unpredictable events are, in part, driving the increasing frequency 
              of &#8216;salient events&#8217; in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.&#8221; That&#8217;s not 
              my argument at all and I never make this statement. My position 
              is that the acceleration of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process, including both 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, results from the greater 
              power of each level of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to create the next level. For example, 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s could proceed 
              more rapidly and more effectively with each stage of results recorded 
              in the evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. With the innovation of sexual reproduction, 
              a more effective means for devising new combinations of genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> became available. Within technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, we 
              also find that each generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> enables the next generation 
              to proceed more rapidly. For example, the first generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              were designed by pen on paper and built with screwdrivers and wires. 
              Compare that to the very rapid design of new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s using today&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>- assisted design tools. </p>
<h2>Ray&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Fallacy</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a> starts his chapter by citing my alleged &#8220;failure 
              to consider the unique <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium.&#8221; However, 
              my thesis repeatedly refers to combining <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s 
              in the same way that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does; for example, &#8220;more 
              advanced neural nets [which] are already using highly detailed models 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, including detailed nonlinear <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> activation 
              functions.&#8221; I go on to cite the advantages of emulating the 
              brain&#8217;s &#8220;digital controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>&#8221; design, and conclude 
              that &#8220;there is a significant efficiency advantage to emulating 
              the brain&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s.&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s are not the 
              exclusive province of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. We used to refer to &#8220;digital 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s&#8221; to distinguish them from the more ubiquitous <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s which were widely used during World War II. </p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> processes can be emulated 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s whereas the reverse is not necessarily the 
              case. However, there are efficiency advantages to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> processing 
              as I point out above. <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s are readily recreated by conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s which are essentially <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. It is only by 
              adding the additional mechanism of comparing the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>&#8217;s 
              output to a threshold that it is made into a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. </p>
<h2>What Turing Fallacy?</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a> states:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The primary criticism that I wish to make of Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              book, is that he proposes to create intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s by copying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains into <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. We might call this the Turing Fallacy. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> suggests that we can know that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have become 
              intelligent when we cannot distinguish them from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, in free 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> over a teletype. The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> is one of the biggest 
              red-herrings in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This paragraph contains several ideas, unrelated ones in my view, 
              but <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s that appear to animate Ray&#8217;s discomfort with &#8220;strong 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.&#8221; I should make the caveat that Ray appears to accept the 
              possibility of an advanced but &#8220;fundamentally alien <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8221; 
              that is &#8220;rooted in and natural to the medium,&#8221; but he 
              dismisses the possibility, as well as the desirability, of AIs sharing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s. He states that &#8220;AIs must certainly be 
              non-Turing,&#8221; which he defines as &#8220;unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s.&#8221; 
              So this is what Ray means by the &#8220;Turing Fallacy.&#8221; He 
              is maintaining that any <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that might emerge in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> 
              mediums would not and could not be a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and would, 
              therefore, be unable to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>.</p>
<p>It is fair to conclude from this that <a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a> accepts the Turing 
              Test as a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able test for &#8220;human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>,&#8221; but 
              makes the point that there could be an alien <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that is 
              very capable in terms of performing intelligent tasks but unable 
              to pass this particular test. I should point out that Turing has 
              made precisely the same point. Turing intended his Test specifically 
              as a measure of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. An <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> passing the Turing 
              Test may be said to be intelligent, and moreover, to possess a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-form 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Turing specifically states that the converse statement 
              does not hold, that failure to pass the Test does not indicate a 
              lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. I&#8217;ve made the same point. As I stated 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a>, certain <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s such as dolphins, 
              giant squids, and certain <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of whales, appear to have relatively 
              high levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, but are in no position to pass the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> (they can&#8217;t type for one thing). Even a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> would 
              not be able to pass the Test if she didn&#8217;t speak the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> judge. The key point of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is sufficiently broad that we can test for the full 
              range of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> dialogues. The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> itself does not represent a fallacy, but rather a keen 
              insight into the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to 
              represent our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> processes. </p>
<p>So where is the fallacy? Ray appears to be <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ing to the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> 
              of creating a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, one whose <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> is 
              sufficiently indistinguishable from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> 
              such that it could pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, on grounds of both desirability 
              and feasibility. </p>
<p>With regard to the first issue, the desirability of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s understanding 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is, I believe, clear from the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> field. As <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have gained proficiency in aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, they have become more useful and more valuable. <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a> 
              is our primary <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s need to understand 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to interact with us in an efficacious manner. 
              Ultimately, they will need to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in a deep 
              way to fully manifest their potential to be our partners in the 
              creation of new <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. And as Turing pointed out, understanding 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, including our <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for understanding and expressing 
              higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, is a prerequisite for effective <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, 
              and is therefore, a necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of skills to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>.</p>
<p> With regard to the issue of feasibility, <a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a> states:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>I accept that this level of computing power is likely 
              to be reached, someday. But no amount of raw <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power will 
              be intelligent in the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> unless it is properly organized. 
              This is a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> problem, not a <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> problem.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I agree with this, of course, as I&#8217;ve had to state several 
              times. A primary scenario that I describe in solving the &#8220;software 
              problem&#8221; is to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s deployed by the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Although I also talk about the potential to copy specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains, I acknowledge that this is a more difficult task and 
              will take longer. <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">Reverse engineering</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is quite feasible, 
              and we are further along in this project than most people realize. 
              As I pointed out earlier, there are many contemporary examples that 
              have demonstrated the feasibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters, and entire <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions, and then <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ing 
              the resulting detailed mathematical models in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> mediums. 
            </p>
<p>I mentioned <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a>&#8217; work in which he has developed a 
              detailed and working model of more than a dozen <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions related 
              to auditory processing. <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a>&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> models, which 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed as <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> processes on <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> 
              chips, capture processes similar to those that take place in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              visual processing. The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and level of detail in these models 
              is expanding exponentially along with the growing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies. This undertaking is 
              similar to the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> project in which we scanned the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> and 
              are now proceeding to understand the three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              and processes described therein. In the mission to scan and reverse 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the neural organization and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, we are approximately where we were in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> project 
              about ten years ago. I estimate that we will complete this project 
              within thirty years, which takes into account an exponential rather 
              than <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> projection of our anticipated <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a> essentially anticipates the answer to his own challenge, 
              when he states that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> for the metallic &#8220;copy&#8221; to have the 
              same function, we would have to abstract the functional properties 
              out of the organic neural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, and find <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s and processes 
              in the new metallic medium that provide identical functions. This 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> and functional-structural translation from the organic 
              into the metallic medium would require a deep understanding of the 
              natural neural processes, combined with the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of many computing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and processes which do not yet exist.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why Ray uses the word &#8220;metallic&#8221; repeatedly, 
              other than to demonstrate his inclination to regard <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> as inherently exhibiting the brittle, mechanical, and 
              unsubtle properties that we have traditionally associated with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              However, in this paragraph, Ray describes the essential process 
              that I have proposed. Many contemporary projects have shown the 
              feasibility of developing and expressing a deep understanding of 
              &#8220;natural neural processes,&#8221; and the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> for that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. </p>
<p>We clearly will need to invent new computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to create 
              the necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, and Ray appears to accept that this will 
              happen. As for inventing new processes, new <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s are continually 
              being developed as well; however, what we have found thus far is 
              that we have encountered few difficulties instantiating these models 
              once they are revealed. The mathematical models derived from the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> process are readily <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed using available 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. </p>
<p>The revealed secrets of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will undoubtedly provide 
              many enabling <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s in the creation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              An added bonus will be deep insight into our own <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, into <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              function and dysfunction. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ray_entry.html">Thomas Ray</a> states that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> or its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              cannot be separated. The circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> provides <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> support 
              for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, but it also delivers hormones that are an integral 
              part of the chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              The membrane of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> is a structural feature defining the limits 
              and integrity of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, but it is also the surface along which 
              depolarization propagates signals. The structural and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-support 
              functions cannot be separated from the handling of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ray goes on to describe several of the &#8220;broad spectrum of 
              chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> mechanisms&#8221; that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> exhibits. 
              However, all of these are readily modelable, and a great deal of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> has already been made in this endeavor. The intermediate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, and translating the mathematical models 
              into equivalent <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> mechanisms is the easiest step in 
              this process. With regard to the delivery of hormones by the circulatory 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, this is an extremely low <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>, which will 
              not be difficult to model and replicate. The blood levels of specific 
              hormones and other chemicals influence <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> levels that affect 
              a great many <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s at once. </p>
<p>Ray concludes that &#8220;a metallic <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> operates 
              on fundamentally different dynamic properties and could never precisely 
              and exactly &#8216;copy&#8217; the function of a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#8221; If one 
              follows closely the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the related fields of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurobiology_entry.html">neurobiology</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> and neural region modeling, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s, and related endeavors, we find that 
              our ability to replicate the <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> functionality of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing can meet any desired level of precision. 
              In other words, the copied functionality can be &#8220;close enough&#8221; 
              for any conceivable purpose or goal, including satisfying a Turing 
              Test judge. Moreover, we find that efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ations of 
              the mathematical models require substantially less <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> than the theoretical potential of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> 
              clusters being modeled. </p>
<p>Ray goes on to describe his own creative proposal for creating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, which is to use <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a>s 
              to allow a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to &#8220;emerge,&#8221; one that 
              is &#8220;rooted in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the medium.&#8221; This would be, 
              according to Ray, a &#8220;non-Turing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>,&#8221; but &#8220;one 
              which would complement rather than duplicate our talents and abilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no problem with this particular idea. Another of Ray&#8217;s 
              mistaken claims is that I offer <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              as the only route to <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>. The truth is that I strongly advocate 
              multiple approaches. I describe the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> idea (among 
              others) because it serves as a useful <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> proof of the feasibility 
              of understanding and replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. In my book 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, I describe a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of other approaches, 
              including the one that Ray prefers (<a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a>s). My 
              own work in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> and other aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> consistently 
              utilizes multiple approaches, and it is inevitable that the ultimate 
              path to <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> will combine insights from a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s. 
              The primary role of developing mathematical models of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the hundreds 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions is to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly-inspired models of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              the insights of which we will then combine with other lines of attack. 
            </p>
<p>With regard to Ray&#8217;s own preference for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary or genetic

              the thousands of bits of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in contemporary genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s may end up falling &#8220;ten orders of magnitude below 
              organic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.&#8221; But the thousands of bits of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              represented by contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are already only four or five 
              orders of magnitude below that of the unique <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> contained 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. </p>
<p>Ray makes several other curious statements. Ray says:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8230;the most complex of our creations are showing alarming 
              failure rates. Orbiting satellites and telescopes, <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttles, 
              interplanetary probes, the Pentium <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s, 
              all seem to be pushing the limits of what we can effectively design 
              and build through conventional approaches&#8230; Our most complex 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s) 
              already contains tens of millions of lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. At present it 
              seems unlikely that we can produce and manage <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> with hundreds 
              of millions or billions of lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all, what alarming failure rates is Ray referring to? 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>ized <a class="thought" href="entries/mission_critical_entry.html">mission critical system</a>s are remarkably reliable. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>ized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of significant sophistication routinely fly and land our 
              airplanes automatically. I am not aware of any airplane crash that 
              has been <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>d to a failure of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, yet many crashes 
              are caused by the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> errors of pilots and maintenance crews. 
              Automated Intensive Care monitoring <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s in hospitals almost 
              never malfunction, yet hundreds of thousands of people die from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> medical errors. If there are alarming failure rates to worry 
              about, it&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> failure, not those of mission critical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. The Pentium <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> problem which Ray alludes to was extremely 
              subtle, caused almost no repercussions, and was quickly rectified. 
            </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s has indeed been scaling 
              up exponentially. Moreover, the cutting edge of our efforts to emulate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will utilize the self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s that 
              we find in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. I am not suggesting that self-organizing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s such as neural nets and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a>s are simple 
              or automatic to use, but they represent powerful tools which will 
              help to alleviate the need for unmanageable levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, it is not the case that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> represents 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> comparable to &#8220;billions of lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>.&#8221; 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is created from a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> of only about 23 million 
              bytes of unique <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (less than <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word). It is through 
              self-organizing processes that incorporate significant <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s 
              of randomness (as well as exposure to the real world) that this 
              small amount of design <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is expanded to the trillions 
              of bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> represented in a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The 
              design of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not based on billions of lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> 
              or the equivalent thereof. Similarly, the task of creating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> will not involve creating

              <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>, but rather a <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, chaotic, self-organizing, <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, one 
              ultimately that is <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired. </p>

<p>This is exactly my own point. The purpose of <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>

<p>Once we have completed the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the several hundred

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that we can do both. At times we will want to impose

<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> continues to grow. It will draw upon many sources of
