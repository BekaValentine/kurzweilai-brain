<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>Steve Mann was one of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab's best-dressed students. It's 
              easy to recognize Steve because you don't see him; you see his <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              His eyes are hidden behind a visor containing small display screens. 
              He looks out through a pair of cameras, which are connected to his 
              displays through a fanny pack full of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s strapped around 
              his waist. Most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the cameras are mounted in front of 
              his eye, but when he rides a bicycle he finds that it's helpful 
              to have one of his <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> eyes looking backward so he can see 
              approaching traffic, or in a crowd he likes to move an eye down 
              to his feet to help him see where he's walking.</p>
<p>Because the path an image takes to reach his eyes passes through 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, he's able to transform what he sees. He can crank up 
              the brightness to help him see in the dark; some days he likes to 
              see like a <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a> and have the background fade out so that he perceives 
              only moving <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s; and over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> he's found that he prefers to 
              have the world appear rotated on its side. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> that he perceives 
              becomes something that can be adjusted under <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> control; once 
              he's had enough of seeing like a <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a>, he can try out any other scheme 
              for viewing the world that he can think of.</p>
<p>The rest of Steve's body is also <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a>. A small <a class="thought" href="entries/handheld_entry.html">handheld</a> keyboard 
              lets him read and write without looking away from whatever else 
              he is doing. It has one key for each finger; by pressing the keys 
              down in combinations he is able to type as fast as he could on a 
              conventional keyboard. Beyond his hands, his clothing is full of 
              sensors connected to other parts of his body. Measurements of his 
              heart rate, perspiration, and footsteps let him add a dashboard 
              for his body to the display in his glasses, warning him when he's 
              running hot and needs to relax.</p>
<p>Since a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> displays and records Steve's world, he can enhance 
              more than just his senses. His <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is augmented by the accumulated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in his <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. By storing and analyzing what he writes, and 
              sees, and hears, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can help him recall when he last met 
              someone, what they spoke about, and what he knows about him or her. 
              Or, if he's fixing one of his ham radios, he can see a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> diagram 
              at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> he sees a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> board.</p>
<p>Steve is not an island; an antenna on his head links him into the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. His body is both a licensed video transmitter and an <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/node_entry.html">node</a>. This lets him send and receive <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> faster 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and bigger <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s than he can carry around. Not only 
              can he exchange e-mail with friends during the course of a day, 
              he can exchange his senses. The <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that goes to his display screens 
              can just as easily be sent around the world; he maintains a Web 
              page with images he's recently seen. Steve's wife can look out through 
              his eyes when he's shopping and help him select fruit, something 
              he doesn't do well. If he's walking down a dark street late at night, 
              he can have some friends look over his virtual shoulder to help 
              keep a remote eye on him.</p>
<p>Working in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab over the last few years has been like 
              living through a B movie, <i>The Invasion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">Cyborg</a>s</i>. One 
              by one our conventionally equipped students have been disappearing, 
              replaced by a new generation that, like Steve, is augmented by wearable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. At first I found it disconcerting to teach to people 
              who were seeing things that I wasn't, but I soon found that the 
              enhancements they were applying to me helped me better communicate 
              with them. When one of Steve's colleagues, Thad Starner, took a 
              seminar from me, he insisted that I make my lecture notes available 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> for him. He wore glasses that projected a display 
              that allowed him to see my text and me at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, so that 
              he took notes on a copy of the lecture that appeared to him to be 
              floating next to me. Because of the apparently intrusive <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              intervening between us I actually had more of his attention than 
              the students flipping through paper copies.</p>
<p>When Thad, Steve, and their peers started wearing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, people 
              would cross the street to get away from them. Now people cross the 
              street to get to them, to find out where they can buy one for themselves. 
              Wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are a revolution that I'm certain will happen, 
              because it already is happening. Three forces are driving this transition: 
              people's desire to augment their innate capabilities, emerging technological 
              insight into how to embed computing into clothing, and industrial 
              demand to move <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> away from where the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are and 
              to where the people are.</p>
<p>FedEx runs one of the world's largest airlines. Unlike an ordinary 
              airline that usually gets a few weeks' notice between the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a 
              ticket is sold and a flight departs, FedEx has just a few hours 
              after it receives a package to make sure that planes are in the 
              right place, at the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, with room for the package. Each 
              step in this nocturnal logistical miracle is invariably a race against 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, as packages are sorted and packed into planes preparing to 
              depart. Literally seconds count, as delays at any point can ripple 
              through the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Ideally, the planning of the fleet's routes 
              and manifests should begin the instant that a driver picks up a 
              package. To be useful, this must be done without encumbering the 
              drivers, who need to be able to speed through crowded offices with 
              awkward loads. This is why FedEx has been a pioneer in the industrial 
              application of wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Their package scanners and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s are moving from the central hubs, to the trucks, to the 
              drivers, so that as soon as an item is collected its <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> can be 
              racing ahead of it on a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> link to prepare its itinerary.</p>
<p>Maintaining a fleet of airplanes like FedEx's presents another 
              industrial demand for wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. The owner's manual for 
              a 747 weighs a few tons, and because of the need to control <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> 
              for safety and liability, it can't even be kept in the hangar where 
              it is needed. It certainly doesn't fit on a plane that must maximize 
              revenue per pound. Keeping the manual up-to-date is a full-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              job, with <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-and-<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> implications that necessitate recording 
              a careful paper trail of changes. Complex maintenance procedures 
              need to be followed by mechanics working in confined spaces, once 
              again keeping a record of each <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> they perform. For these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s aviation mechanics are beginning to wear <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with 
              display glasses that let them follow instructions without looking 
              away from their work, disk drives that can store a mountain of manuals 
              (one <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a> holds about a million pages of text), and <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> connections 
              that automate the record keeping.</p>
<p>While an airplane mechanic is willing to strap on pounds of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              gear in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to get <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> 
              Lab grad student will do the same as a lifestyle choice, most everyone 
              else is unlikely to be willing to walk around looking like they 
              were wearing flypaper when a hurricane hit an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s store. 
              Fortunately, we're <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to provide the functionality of 
              a wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> without the inconvenience of the crude early 
              models.</p>
<p>It's a safe assumption that the clothes you wear are near a body 
              (yours). One of my former grad students, Tom Zimmerman (now at <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>), 
              realized that this trivial observation has a remarkable implication. 
              Tom had come back to grad school after inventing the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> Glove, 
              a glove full of wires that measures the location and <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> 
              of a hand. The company he cofounded, VPL, developed this glove into 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> that helped launch the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, 
              letting people use physical interactions to manipulate virtual worlds. 
              But Tom was dissatisfied with the cumbersome wires and wanted to 
              find new ways to build <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s that are as natural as the physical 
              world.</p>
<p>Tom arrived at the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab around the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that we were working 
              on a collaboration with Tod Machover and the violinist Ani Kavafian. 
              After the project with Yo-Yo I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that I understood everything 
              there was to know about measuring the position of the bow of a stringed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>. Moments after putting the sensors on Ani's violin it 
              was clear that something was very wrong: we were finding the location 
              of her hand, not the bow. Yo-Yo plays his Strad sitting down, with 
              his hand above the bridge; Ani plays hers standing up, with her 
              hand beyond the bridge. Something about this change in <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> 
              was leading to an interaction between her hand and the electric 
              field that was supposed to detect the bow.</p>
<p>I was puzzled by this <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a> because the signal went in the wrong 
              direction. I expected that by placing her hand between the transmitting 
              and receiving electrodes she would improve the coupling and make 
              the signal stronger, but her hand had exactly the opposite effect 
              and made the signal weaker. I tried unsuccessfully to solve the 
              complex equations that are needed to predict this behavior; then 
              I did something very smart: I went on a trip to Europe and left 
              Tom alone in the lab. While I was away, he walked down to the corner 
              deli and had them fill a glove with hamburger. While they were left 
              wondering about Tom's odd taste, he brought this armless hand back 
              to the lab and confirmed that it caused the signals to move in the 
              direction that I had expected&#8212;up. When he connected the hand 
              to a wire arm, the interaction then flipped to make the signal go 
              down. The source of our problem was immediately clear: part of Ani's 
              body was in the field and part was out; she was guiding the field 
              away from the receiver and out to the room.</p>
<p>Tom then realized that we should be able to detect the part of 
              the field that was passing through her body. This creates a tiny 
              current (about 0.0000001 percent of what illuminates a lightbulb). 
              To find such a small signal buried in all of the other possible 
              sources of electrical interference, we used a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> that was matched 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that was being transmitted. Therefore, if we could 
              find that <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>, we could find other ones. In other words, we 
              could transmit <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> through a body. The <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a> could become quite a 
              feature.</p>
<p>We soon had a prototype working. A transmitting unit, about the 
              size of a deck of cards, had a pair of electrodes on opposite sides 
              that created an electric field. Placed near a body, for example 
              in a shoe, the field changed the body's average voltage by a tiny 
              amount. A similar receiving unit could measure this voltage change 
              at another part of the body. By varying the tiny voltage, a message 
              could be exchanged. This means that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in a shoe could send 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to a display in a wristwatch without needing wires. There are 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wan_entry.html">Wide Area Network</a>s (WANs) to link up cities, and <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">Local Area Network</a>s 
              (LANs) to link up buildings; we had created a Personal Area <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a> 
              (PAN) to connect parts of a body.</p>
<p>Unlike a conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> radio, PAN keeps personal <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in 
              the body, where it belongs. The radio spectrum is one of the scarcest 
              of modern resources, as more and more applications vie for the available 
              channels. One way to use the spectrum efficiently is to divide it 
              up geographically, such as the roughly one-kilometer cells used 
              for mobile telephones. PAN shrinks the cells down to one body. A 
              roomful of people could be using it without interfering with each 
              other, or worrying about someone surreptitiously eavesdropping&#8212;unless 
              they approach close enough to pick the bits out of their pockets.</p>
<p>Within one body, PAN provides a means to get rid of the wires in 
              a wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Between bodies, it can do much more. Two people 
              using it could exchange an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> business card just by shaking 
              hands. A hand on a doorknob could send the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to unlock a door, 
              or the act of picking up an airport telephone could <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> the 
              day's messages. The <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of a package could be read automatically 
              as it is picked up.</p>
<p>Right now, gestures are either physical (exchanging a printed card) 
              or logical (exchanging e-mail). With PAN, physical gestures can 
              take on logical meaning. We've spent millennia as a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              how to manage our physical interactions with people and things. 
              We have a comfortable protocol for when and where to shake hands. 
              Rather than decouple such familiar gestures from the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world, 
              PAN helps create a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> that merges the logical and physical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> helps you to think globally but not 
              to act locally; a Person Wide Web is needed for that.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise about PAN is that it has been such a surprise. 
              There's very little precedent for this idea, which is so obvious 
              in retrospect. In the postlude to 3001: The Final Odyssey, Arthur 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Clarke complains that he <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> he had invented the idea of 
              exchanging <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> through a handshake as a capability for the next 
              millennium, and was mortified to later find out that we were already 
              doing it.</p>
<p>Dick Tracy might have had his wristwatch TV, but the real implications 
              of wearing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have been too unexpected to be anticipated 
              by fiction. Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> becomes continuously available it literally 
              becomes part of the fabric of our lives rather than just an appliance 
              for work or play. It is a very different <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.</p>
<p>The closest fictional predecessor to PAN was Maxwell Smart's shoe 
              phone, which he had to take off (invariably at the most inopportune 
              times) if he wanted to call the Chief. PAN now lets Max keep his 
              shoes on, and shoes are in fact an ideal <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> for computing. 
              You almost always have your shoes with you; you don't need to remember 
              to carry them along when you leave the house in the morning. There's 
              plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> available in a shoe for <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry&#8212;no companies 
              are yet fighting over <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to your shoes, but they will. When 
              you walk, watts of power pass through your feet and get dissipated 
              in abrading your shoes and impacting the ground; it's possible to 
              put materials in a shoe that produce a voltage when they are flexed, 
              which can be used as a power source. With realistic generation efficiencies 
              of a few percent there's plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> available for a low-power 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Instead of lugging around a laptop's power supply and 
              adapters, and feeding it batteries, you just need to go for a walk 
              every now and then, and feed yourself. Finally, PAN lets a shoe 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> energize <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ories around your body, communicating with 
              a wristwatch or eyeglasses. Running down this list of specifications, 
              it's apparent that a foot bottom makes much more <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> than a lap 
              top. Shoe <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are no <a class="thought" href="entries/joke_entry.html">joke</a>.</p>
<p>Wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are really just a natural consequence of the 
              personalization of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. The original impersonal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              were <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s, locked away in remote rooms. Then came <a class="thought" href="entries/minicomputer_entry.html">minicomputer</a>s, 
              which could be shared by one workgroup. From there came the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>, 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> used by a single person. This allowed much more personal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, as long as you equate computing with sitting in front 
              of a beige box with a cathode ray tube, keyboard, and <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>. Wearables 
              finally let a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> come to its user rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>Joel Birnbaum, the <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful senior vice president for <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              and development at Hewlett Packard, notes that in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry 
              "peripherals are central." Most of the attention in the business, 
              and press, has been focused on the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              (processor speed, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> size, . . . ). But as PCs increasingly 
              become commodities like toasters, which are more-or-less interchangeable 
              and sold based on price, the emphasis is shifting to the external 
              peripherals that people use to interact with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. From 
              there it's a small step to focus on your <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ories instead of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s: the eyeglasses that can serve as displays for your 
              eyes, the earrings that can whisper a message into your ears. Right 
              now the demand for such wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s is being imperfectly 
              met by home-brew parts and small startup firms. Since high-tech 
              industries abhor a product <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, this is sure to be filled by 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> companies seeking to grow beyond their current saturated 
              markets.</p>
<p>If <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have become like toasters, then <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> has become 
              like toast. Interacting with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is all too often about as 
              satisfying as interacting with a piece of toast, filling without 
              being particularly stimulating, frequently overdone, and with a 
              nasty habit of leaving messy crumbs of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> everywhere. Just 
              as wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s replace the homogeneity of uniform <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> 
              with the ultimate in personalization, their intimate connection 
              with their wearer helps do the same for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s currently have no idea whether you're happy or sad, tense 
              or relaxed, bored or excited. These affective states have enormous 
              implications for your relationship with the world; if you're in 
              a good mood I'll tell you different things than if you're in a bad 
              one. A person who cannot perceive affect is <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>ally handicapped 
              and cannot function normally in <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, and the same is true of 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>Because they have no idea what state you're in, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are uniformly 
              cheerful, or bland, behavior that is just as annoying in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              as it is in a person. Affect has very immediate implications. Studies 
              have shown that if you're stressed, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> delivered quickly 
              helps you relax; if you're relaxed, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> delivered quickly 
              makes you stressed. Something as simple as the pace at which a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              delivers <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> should depend on your mood.</p>
<p>Steve Mann's thesis advisor Roz Picard has been finding that the 
              kind of sensor <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that a wearable can collect about its wearer 
              (temperature, perspiration, muscle tension, and so forth), coupled 
              with the techniques that have been developed in the last decade 
              to let <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s such as faces in images, enables 
              a wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to do a surprisingly good job of perceiving 
              affect by analyzing the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that it records. But this shouldn't 
              be very surprising: you routinely do the same with other people 
              just by looking and listening.</p>
<p>As unsettling as it might be to contemplate a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that is 
              aware of your mood, the converse is to be forced to tolerate one 
              that is sure to almost always respond to it inappropriately. Byron 
              Reeves and Clifford Nass at Stanford have shown that most of what 
              we know about the <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> interaction carries over to 
              how people interact with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s; whatever our intentions, we 
              already relate to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as we do to people. The Stanford group 
              has observed that most of the behavior that you can read about in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> textbooks also occurs between people and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s: aggressive 
              people prefer aggressive instructions from the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> while more 
              withdrawn people prefer instructions that are phrased more gently, 
              people are more critical in evaluating a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> if they fill out 
              a survey on a second <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> than if they fill it out on the one 
              being evaluated, and so forth. Because we subconsciously expect 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to be able to understand us, we must give them the means 
              to do so.</p>
<p>Even more disturbing than the prospect of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that knows 
              how you feel is one that can share this most personal of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              with other people, but here, too, the benefits can outweigh the 
              risks. My colleague Mike Hawley worked with Harry Winston Jewelers 
              to create what must be the world's most expensive <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> display, 
              a $500,000 diamond brooch with a heart-rate monitor that lets it 
              pulse red in synchrony with its wearer's heartbeat. While you may 
              not want to wear your heart on your sleeve, how about letting your 
              jewelry tell a romantic interest when your heart skips a beat?</p>
<p>This fanciful brooch was part of the world's first wearable fashion 
              show, held at the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab in the fall of 1997. I began to realize 
              that wearables were turning from <a class="thought" href="entries/geek_entry.html">geek</a>-chic to high fashion when 
              two of our grad students, Rehmi Post and Maggie Orth, figured out 
              how to use conducting threads to embroider <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry on fabric. 
              Using filaments of Kevlar and stainless steel, they were able to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-controlled sewing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to stitch traces that 
              could carry <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and power, as well as <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> the press of a finger. 
              They call this <i>e-broidery</i>. It allowed them to get rid of 
              the last of the apparent wires in a wearable, marrying the form 
              and function into the garment. One of the first applications was 
              a Levi's denim jacket that doubles as a musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>: a keypad 
              sewn onto the front of the jacket lets the wearer call up rhythmic 
              backing and play accompanying melodic fills. I suspect that Josh 
              Strickon, the student who <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med the jacket's musical <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>, 
              is the first person from MIT to publish <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in Vogue, appearing 
              as a model to display the jacket.</p>
<p>Freed from the need to strap on external <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, it was natural 
              to start wondering what wearables could look like. This was a question 
              for designers, not technologists, and so we turned to the fashion 
              schools of the world. Guided by Thad's advisor Sandy Pentland, students 
              from the Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo, Creapole in Paris, Domus 
              in Milan, and the Parsons School of Design in New York submitted 
              designs; the best were invited to come to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab to build 
              them. Among the lively creations was a dress that played <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> based 
              on the proximity of nearby bodies, dancing shoes full of sensors 
              that controlled the sights and sounds of a performance, and a jacket 
              made with an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ink that could change back and forth between 
              a solid color and pinstripes under <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> (softwear?) control.</p>
<p>We weren't prepared to handle the enormous press interest in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. Because clothing is so very personal, the reporting crossed 
              over from the technical journalists usually seen around MIT to mainstream 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. The many ensuing interviews conveyed a recurring <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of 
              wonder, and fear, at the arrival of wearables. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of the 
              show made clear that ordinary people may be wearing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in 
              the not-too-distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, raising endless questions about the 
              implications for how we're all going to live with them.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">Privacy</a> was a recurring concern. If it's already hard to sneeze 
              without someone noticing it and selling your name in a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> 
              of cold-sufferers, what's going to happen if you carry a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              everywhere? Here I think that wearables are part of the solution, 
              not the problem. Right now you're <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly unprotected; most of 
              your <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s and transactions are available to anyone who 
              legally or illegally has the right equipment to detect them. From 
              pulling charge slips out of a trash can to scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_phone_entry.html">cellular phone</a> 
              frequencies, it doesn't take much ambition to peer into people's 
              private lives. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you call a toll-free <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, or use a 
              credit card, you're releasing quite a few bits of personal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              to relative strangers.</p>
<p>There are cryptographic protocols that can ensure that you have 
              complete control over who gets <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to what <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and when; 
              the problem is using them. If you have to boot up your laptop each 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you want to make a secure phone call, you're unlikely to use 
              it. By wearing a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that is routinely <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible, you can 
              erect a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> shield to help protect you by sending and 
              receiving only what you intend. This won't be impermeable; <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> 
              is not an absolute good, but a complex and personal tradeoff. If 
              you go into a store and make your <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible, 
              the store can give you better service because they learn about your 
              preferences, and a discount because you've given them demographic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, but you've lost some <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>. If you turn your <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> 
              off, you can cryptographically perform a secure transaction that 
              lets you make a purchase without the store <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> anything about 
              you, but it comes at a higher price and with worse service.</p>
<p>Another <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to consider sharing private <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is for security. 
              A cop walking the beat can see and hear only part of one street; 
              wearables let many people see many places at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. While 
              this certainly does raise questions about the spread of surveillance 
              (students in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab made Steve Mann put a red <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> on his 
              head to indicate when his eyes were on-line), a mugging is also 
              quite an invasion of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>. The balance between openness and <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> 
              can't be settled in advance for all people in all situations; the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> needs to enable a continuous balance that can be adjusted 
              as needed. On a lonely street late at night I want as many friends 
              as possible to know what's happening around me; in a complex business 
              negotiation I might want to make sure that some people elsewhere 
              know everything and some know nothing; when I'm at home I may choose 
              to let no one else have any <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to me.</p>
<p>Along with loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>, another fear is loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a>. What 
              happens if we come to rely on these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s? Thad, Steve, and their 
              peers have confounded conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> about how long it's possible 
              to be immersed in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> environment. Early studies had suggested 
              that after a few hours people start becoming disoriented and suffering 
              ill effects; Thad and Steve have been wearing their <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s all 
              day long for years. What the studies missed was the extent to which 
              their wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have become an essential part of how these 
              people function. Instead of performing an assigned task in a laboratory 
              setting, they depend on their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to see, and hear, and think. 
              They are incomplete without them.</p>
<p>That's a less radical step than it might appear to be, because 
              it's one we've all made. We're surrounded by technologies that we 
              depend on to function in a modern <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. Without the power for 
              heat and <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, the fabrics for protection from the environment, 
              the printing for newspapers and books, the fuel for <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>, 
              we could still survive, but it would be a much more difficult <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. 
              It can be satisfying to throw off all of those things for a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              and go camping in the woods, but even that is done by most people 
              by relying on a great deal of portable <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for shelter and 
              convenience. We are happy to consult a library to provide <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              that we can't obtain by introspection; Steve and Thad go just a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> further to take advantage of a vast library of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that 
              is continuously available to them.</p>
<p>Glasses are a familiar <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that we rely on to correct vision. 
              Some people cannot function without the lenses that let them see 
              near, or far, and some have vision problems that cannot be corrected 
              by ordinary glasses. A wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is equally useful for both, 
              blurring the distinction between them. Whether or not you can read 
              large or small print, you can't see in the dark, or see around the 
              world, or look backward and forward at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Wearables 
              can certainly help with disabilities, but the range of what we consider 
              to be abled and disabled is actually quite small compared to what 
              both types of people can do by enhancing their senses with active 
              processing. Many people are unwilling to give up these kinds of 
              capabilities once they <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> them. There's nothing new about 
              that; the same is true of eyeglasses wearers.</p>
<p>A final concern with wearables is loss of community. A quick glance 
              around an office where people who used to eat lunch together now 
              sit alone surfing the Web makes clear that the expansion in global 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> has come at the cost of local <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. The members 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> family are already more likely than not to be found at 
              home in separate rooms, typing away at their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, even if 
              they're just answering each other's e-mail. What's going to happen 
              to interpersonal relationships if the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> becomes continuously 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible?</p>
<p>The responsibility for this loss of personal contact lies more 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> on the desktop than with the person sitting in 
              front of it. Finding out what's happening around the world is interesting, 
              as is finding out what's happening around you. Right now the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              forces an unacceptable decision between doing one or the other.</p>
<p>As wearable computing wraps the Net around people this is going 
              to change. I'm confident that for quite some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> people will remain 
              more engaging than <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, but finding the right person at the 
              right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> might require looking next door or on the next continent. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s currently facilitate interactions that would not otherwise 
              have occurred, with tools such as groupware that permit multiple 
              people to work on a document, or videoconferencing that lets meetings 
              happen among people at many sites. These functions require special 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, and even rooms, and are consequently used primarily 
              for narrow business purposes. Once wearables make it possible to 
              see, or hear, anyone at anytime, then interacting with people physically 
              far away can become as routine as talking to someone in front of 
              you. A person having a polite <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> might equally well be 
              talking to their neighbor, to a friend around the world, or even 
              to their shoes; the whole notion of neighborhood becomes a logical 
              rather than a physical <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>.</p>
<p>"<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a>ing" then becomes something much more compelling than passing 
              around business cards at a cocktail party. If a group of people 
              share their resources, they can accomplish many things that they 
              could not do <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly. For example, the performance of a portable 
              radio is limited by the range of frequencies that are available 
              (decided by the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> regulatory agencies), the amount 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> in the receiver (which is ultimately determined by the 
              temperature of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>), and the strength of the signal (a function 
              of the size of the antenna). There isn't much that one person can 
              do about these things, short of wearing cryogenic underwear or an 
              inverted umbrella on his or her head. But radio astronomers have 
              long understood how to combine the signals from multiple antennas 
              to make an observation that could not be done by a single one. Processing 
              the signals from many small antennas to effectively create one large 
              one requires knowing precisely where each antenna is. This might 
              not appear to work with people, who have an annoying habit of moving 
              around, but we're <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to design radios that can automatically 
              synchronize and share their signals with other radios in their vicinity. 
              If you want to exchange <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> with a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> from a wearable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and a few nearby people agree to let you temporarily run 
              your signals through their radios, you can send and receive <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> 
              twice as fast as you could alone. Since <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> traffic usually 
              happens in bursts, when you're not using your radio they in turn 
              can take advantage of it. The same thing can be done with computing, 
              temporarily borrowing unused processor <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> from the people around 
              you to speed up <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally intensive tasks.</p>
<p>Al Gore has observed that the U.S. Constitution can be viewed as 
              a sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> written for an enormous parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              the populace. By following its instructions, many people together 
              can do what they could not do separately. When <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> becomes 
              continuously available, the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> becomes literal. Polling, voting, 
              and legislating can become part of our ongoing collective <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              rather than isolated events. Instead of using a few monitors to 
              oversee a controversial election, an entire nation could bear witness 
              to itself if enough people were <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> with wearables.</p>
<p>It's not too far from there to see wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as a new 
              step in our <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. The organization of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has 
              been defined by <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. It was a big advance for <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s 
              to work together to form cells, for cells to work together to form 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, for <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s to work together to form families, and for 
              families to work together to form communities. Each of these steps, 
              clearly part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, conferred <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant benefits 
              that were of value to the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Moving computing into clothing 
              opens a new era in how we interact with each other, the defining 
              characteristic of what it means to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>.</p>
