<div class="TeaserText">The Golden Age of space travel is still ahead of us. Over the next 50 years, thousands of people will gain access to the orbital realm -- and then, to the Moon and beyond, says Sir Arthur, 89.</div>
<br>
<br> <p>Friends, Earthlings, ETs&#8212;lend me your sensory organs!</p>
<p>I send you greetings and good wishes at the beginning of another 
              year. I&#8217;ll be celebrating (?) my 90<sup>th</sup> birthday in December&#8212;a 
              few weeks after the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Age completes its first half century. <br>
<br>
              When the late and unlamented Soviet Union launched <a class="thought" href="entries/sputnik_entry.html">Sputnik</a> 1 on 
              4 October 1957, it took only about five minutes for the world to 
              realise what had happened. And although I had been writing and speaking 
              about space travel for years, the moment is still frozen in my own 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>: I was in Barcelona attending the 8<sup>th</sup> International Astronautical 
              Congress. We had retired to our hotel rooms after a busy day of 
              presentations when the news broke&#8212;I was awakened by reporters 
              seeking comments on the Soviet feat. Our theories and speculations 
              had suddenly become <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>!<br>
<br>
              Notwithstanding the remarkable accomplishments during the past 50 
              years, I believe that the Golden Age of space travel is still ahead 
              of us. Before the current decade is out, fee-paying passengers will 
              be experiencing sub-orbital flights aboard privately funded passenger 
              vehicles, built by a new generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er-<a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s with 
              an unstoppable passion for space (I&#8217;m hoping I could still 
              make such a journey myself). And over the next 50 years, thousands 
              of people will gain <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the orbital realm&#8212;and then, to 
              the Moon and beyond. <br>
<br>
              During 2006, I followed with interest the emergence of this new 
              breed of &#8216;Citizen Astronauts&#8217; and private space enterprise. 
              I am very encouraged by the wide-spread acceptance of the Space 
              Elevator, which can make space transport cheap and affordable to 
              ordinary people. This daring engineering <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>, which I popularised 
              in <i>The Fountains of Paradise </i>(1978), is now taken very seriously, 
              with space agencies and entrepreneurs investing money and effort 
              in developing prototypes. A dozen of these parties competed for 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>-sponsored, US$ 150,000 X Prize Cup which took place in 
              October 2006 at the Las Cruces International Airport, New Mexico.<br>
<br>
              The Arthur Clarke Foundation continues to recognise and cheer-lead 
              men and women who blaze new trails to space. A few days before the 
              X Prize Cup competition, my old friend Walter Cronkite received 
              the Foundation&#8217;s Lifetime Achievement Award. I have known Walter 
              for over half a century, and my commentary with him during the heady 
              days of the Apollo Moon landings now belongs to another era. A space 
              &#8216;pathfinder&#8217; of the Twenty First Century, Bob Bigelow, 
              was presented the <a class="thought" href="entries/clarke_entry.html">Arthur C. Clarke</a> Innovator Award for his work 
              in the development of space habitats. With the successful launch 
              of Bigelow Aerospace&#8217;s Genesis 1, Bob is leading the way for 
              private <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s willing to advance space exploration with minimum 
              reliance on <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mes. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, planning and fund-raising work continued for the Arthur 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> Clarke Centre "to investigate the reach and impact of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>." to be <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up in partnership with the University 
              of Nevada, Las Vegas. <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">Object</a>ive: to identify young people with robust 
              imagination, to help their parents and teachers make the most of 
              that talent, and to accord imagination as much regard as high academic 
              grades in the classroom - anywhere in the world. The Board members 
              of the Clarke Foundation, led by its indefatigable Chairman Tedson 
              Meyers, have taken on the challenge of raising US$ 70 million for 
              this project. I&#8217;m hopeful that the billion dollar <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              satellite industry I founded 60 years ago with my <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">Wireless</a> World 
              paper (October 1945), for which I received the astronomical sum 
              of &#163;15, will be partners in this endeavour. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only been able to make a few encouraging noises from 
              the sidelines for these and other worthy projects as I&#8217;m now 
              very limited in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> owing to Post Polio. But I&#8217;m 
              happy to report that my health remains stable, and I&#8217;m in no 
              discomfort or pain. Being completely wheel-chaired helps to concentrate 
              on my reading and writing&#8212;which I can once again engage in, 
              with the second cataract <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> restoring my eyesight.<br>
<br>
              During the year, I wrote a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of short articles, book reviews 
              and commentaries for a variety of print and online outlets. I also 
              did a few carefully chosen <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> interviews, and filmed several 
              video greetings to <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant scientific or literary gatherings in 
              different parts of the world.<br>
<br>
              I was particularly glad to find a co-author to complete my last 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>, The Last Theorem, which remained half-written for a couple 
              of years. I had mapped out the entire story, but then found I didn&#8217;t 
              have the energy to work on the balance text. Accomplished American 
              writer Frederik Pohl has now taken up the challenge. Meanwhile, 
              co-author Stephen Baxter has completed First-born, the third novel 
              in our collaborative Time Odyssey series, to be published in 2007.<br>
<br>
              Members of my adopted family&#8212;Hector, Valerie, Cherene, 
              Tamara and Melinda Ekanayake&#8212;are keeping well. Hector has 
              been looking after me since 1956, and with his wife Valerie, has 
              made a home for me at 25, Barnes Place, Colombo. Hector continued 
              to rebuild the diving operation that was wiped out by the Indian 
              Ocean Tsunami of December 2004. <a class="thought" href="entries/sri_entry.html">Sri</a> Lanka&#8217;s tourist sector, 
              still recovering from the mega-disaster, weathered a further crisis 
              as the long-drawn civil conflict ignited again after more than three 
              years of relative peace and quiet. I remain hopeful that a lasting 
              solution would be worked out by the various national and international 
              players engaged in the peace process.<br>
<br>
              I&#8217;m still missing and mourning my beloved Chihuahua Pepsi, 
              who left us more than a year ago. I&#8217;ve just heard that dogs 
              aren&#8217;t allowed in Heaven, so I&#8217;m not going there.<br>

<p>Arthur C. Clarke's "Maelstrom II" short story is expected 
              to be released as an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614022857/http://www.distant-galaxy.com/maelstrom2/MaelstromII.html" target="_blank">HD

              "I think it may play an important role in the future of space

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> I don't believe we will reach a tolerant and cooperative society under present technology, nor should we. I suspect that our brains are designed to be incomplete in their functions so we won;t achieve the unity we seek, because the ultimate outcome will likely be entropy and death. I believe religions presently serve an important function, which is to keep us divided and looking for personal answers to help advance what little curiosity hasn't already been snuffed out by bureaucracies seeking to gain full control into one legal system that leaves little rom for freedom.
<br>
<br>
 Religion acts as what Marshall McLuhan called a counter irritant. It causes us to seek personal reasons for our existence, to identify somehow with a god that created this universe with meaning and made us a part of that meaning.
<br>
<br>
 Governments cannot do that because they are built on mechanical processes, and mechanical processes do not generate life. They cannot even imitate life. Religion, with all its wars and confusion and hatred, seeks the meaning and purpose of life apart from the meanings supplied by human logic and mechanical governments.
<br>
<br>
 Of course Western reliogion has merely mimicked the mechanical process ogf government and created religious bureaucracies to run alongside government. We won't find true meaning until we walk away from both processes and simply live as individuals, but only a few will ever do that.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I believe a combination of Arthur C. Clark's popularized idea of suspended animation for space travel and Ray Kurzweil's reengineered humans from nanotechnology will give us virtual time travel.  The conscious mind suspended in unconsciousness by a robotic body.  This way while traveling through the solar system as an astronaut, we virtually experience minutes of perception while taking a decade to reach Saturn for instance.  For perception's sake we can take snapshots of our travels every so often for the thrill of it.  Even though it would take a decade of travel time, there would be no time in our unconscious mind.   From our minds point of view it would only take seconds of travel time.  We could virtually reach another star system in seconds of consciousness.  The only thing we've got to loose is time.  And in a Universe that's billions of years old and to come, time doesn't seem to be in short supply.  </p></td>
