<h1>Excerpts from <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s remarks:</h1>
<p>"In considering the genesis of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, I put 49 famous 
              computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s over the past century on an exponential graph. 
              From this exercise, it became apparent that the acceleration of 
              computing power did not start with <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, but has 
              continued through multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s(electromechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, 
              relays, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, and finally <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s).</p>
<p>"Moore's Law was not the first, but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, to 
              provide <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in computing. The next <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, which 
              will involve computing in three dimensions rather than the two manifested 
              in today's flat chips, will lead to computing at the molecular, 
              and ultimately the <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> level. We can be confident that the 
              acceleration of computing will survive the well-anticipated demise 
              of Moore' s Law.</p>
<p>"There are comparable <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s underlying a wide 
              variety of other technologies: <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s (both <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>), 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning speeds and resolutions, <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> scanning, and <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> 
              (we are currently shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> 
              dimension per decade). Even the rate of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is 
              speeding up, now doubling each decade. The mathematical models I've 
              developed over the past couple of decades to describe these trends, 
              which I call the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>, has proven predictive 
              of the developments we've seen during the 1990s. From these models, 
              I believe we can be confident of continued <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in 
              these and other technologies for the foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>"By 2009, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will disappear. Displays will be written 
              directly onto our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s by <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s in our eyeglasses and contact 
              lenses. In addition to virtual high-resolution displays, these intimate 
              displays will provide full immersion visual <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. We 
              will have ubiquitous, very-high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connection to 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> at all times. "Going to a web site" will 
              mean entering a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment -- at least for the 
              visual and auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> -- where we will meet other real people. 
              There will be simulated people as well, but the virtual personalities 
              will not be up to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> standards, at least not by 2009. The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s 
              for all of this will be so small that it will be invisibly embedded 
              in our glasses and clothing.</p>
<p>"By 2029, as a result of continuing trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, we will have billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s 
              -- intelligent robots the same of blood cells or smaller -- traveling 
              through the capillaries of our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> communicating directly with 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. By taking up positions next to every <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> 
              fiber coming from all of our senses, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will provide full-immersion 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> involving all five of the senses. So we will enter 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments (via the web, of course) of our choice 
              and meet people, both real and virtual, only now the difference 
              won't be so clear.</p>
<p>"Just as people today beam their images from little web cams 
              out onto the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> for others to share, many people in 2029 will 
              beam the full stream of signals coming directly from their senses 
              onto the web. We will then be able to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> what other people 
              are experiencing, &#224; la John Malkovich. Of course, the everyday 
              lives of many such <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> beamers may not be all that compelling, 
              so there will be plenty of prerecorded <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s we can plug into 
              it. Beyond just the five senses, these shared <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s will include 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al responses, sexual pleasure, and other mental reactions.</p>
<p>"Brain implants based on these distributed intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s 
              will extend our brains in every conceivable way, massively expanding 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and otherwise vastly improving all of our sensory, <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-recognition 
              and cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>"Oh, and one more thing: we'll live a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> too. The expanding 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span is another one of those <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s. In the 
              eighteenth century, we added a few days every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> longevity; 
              during the nineteenth century we added a couple of weeks each year; 
              and now we're adding almost a half a year every year. With the revolutions 
              in rational drug design, <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a>, therapeutic cloning of our own 
              organs and tissues, and related developments in bio-<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s, we will be adding more than a year every year within ten 
              years. So take care of yourself the old-fashioned way for just a 
              little while longer, and you may actually get to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> the 
              remarkable century ahead."</p>

<br>
Jeremy&gt; Of course, when this happens, who knows what else will go the way of the dodo.
<br>
<br>
Anything else will be purely for the sake of broadening one's horizons. A world of unlimited, free intellectual and 'spiritual' (artistic, whatever) pursuits is my definition of Utopia.
<br>
<br>
Jeremy&gt;Some folks may continue their intellectual pursuits, but why? Anything humans can do, AIs will be doing better... making your "broadening horizons" look rather narrow. 
<br>
When people like you put yourself out of a job (the rest of us too) we will soon be outpaced by thinking machines. Sure, we will have all our needs met, but but any control over how that is done will be lost forever. Lazy, greedy, smart but lacking wisdom, and trapped in our golden cage.</p></td>

This goes from the "invention" of the cell membrane four billion years ago to fire and stone tools to computers and genetic engineering today and in the future.  Carried to the ultimate conclusion this means that the ultimate purpose for life is to evolve gods or godlike beings capable of altering our internal and external environments at will.  The ultimate question is "Is the universe big enough for large numbers of competing gods?"  We can have hope that this problem has been solved by other advanced lifeforms since we don't observe any obvious signs of cosmic warfare between the gods in the heavens.  On the other hand we don't have the foggiest idea what that warfare would look like or whether the transition from biological entity to "godhood" is even possible.

Nevertheless, let's remember that the agent is part of the system. Considering this, the total outcome would be an increased level of efficiency and order (entropy). A clear conclusion then is that life and its evolved prospects are the force that will have a glorious impact on the faith of the universe. It is certainly impossible to predict the nature of this 'destiny', but I like the idea of increasing level of awareness and conciseness that would arise as this organic/technological/pattern explosive, ever expanding, intelligence mass creates as it develops.
<br>
<br>
Concerning the different levels of awareness and evolutionary states that co-exist, I think it is perfectly possible for one level to be completely ignorant of the other 'think bacteria and a human being. In a less dramatic example we can imagine a pet -- let's say a dog -- and its master; they cooperate and synergize, nevertheless they operate in different levels of awareness. Taking this exercise a level up, it is perfectly reasonable then to acknowledge that a vast number of levels exist above us. Why we do not see them? Maybe we do, and we are not conscious of it -- probably it is not even ethical for them to proceed and be recognized in some way or another. 
<br>
<br>
In the short term, technology will allow us to bite our tails ' to modify, enhance and expand our 'program' -- by the combined usage of biology, nanotechnology and cybernetics. This creates yet another self-referential loop, which outcome will carry us to a new level of awareness. No matter if we become mecha or enhanced orga or both, we will communicate better, live longer, and create new levels of order. At the individual level one thing remains: The satisfaction ' think happiness -- in seeking, exploring, creating and expressing.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Dear Pablo,
<br>
<br>
Certainly, you can ascribe certain general characteristics to successful lifeforms, but it is less easy to explain why they become extinct.  By all measures, the dinosaurs were a very successful and vibrant group of creatures, but one day a very unlucky hit by a big, old rock put an end to them.  Similarly, technology has, in general, been the best of friends to the human race, providing us with great amounts of food and comfort and breeding opportunities.  But there is that nagging problem of 50,000 or so nuclear warheads ready and waiting to do their thing to turn the earth into a blackened wasteland.  And there is the scary and not too distant prospect that an unenlightened and only moderately talented genetic engineer might do a little mixing and matching of viral genomes to produce a cross between, say, a cold virus and an ebola virus to create a malevalent monster that mother nature would never dream of.  This one bad guy might be able to undo the good work of tens of thousands of good and industrious genetic engineers in their efforts to help mankind.  It's just like the single bad day the dinosaurs had 65 million years ago.  The millions of previous sunny and warm days in the Cretaceous told them that they had it made in the shade.  But it didn't work out that way.  It seems to me that we are throwing a lot of very big rocks around in the neighborhood of the human race and one is bound to come crashing back: nuclear warfare, grey ooze or viral bombs - any one and many others can give rise to that very bad day that the dinosaurs experienced.
<br>
<br>
I hope we make it.  But the lesson of the dinosaurs tells us that our survival isn't guaranteed.  And speaking of faith, I for one hope and pray that the Creator made this huge, long-lasting universe to propagate love.  After all, physicists tell us it is easy to change a few universal constants and create a universe that self destructs promptly, with no hope for life.  Why waste everyone's time with a universe which produces sentient beings only if they are doomed to blow themselves up?  We've gotta have faith and hope, but now more than ever is the time to study ethics and learn the basis for doing the right thing for our fellow sentient beings.  Pray for peace!

<br>
<br>
However, if we make it past these threats, the accelerating intelligence thing is sort of troublesome as well. I doubt that once we ascended to god status, we would stop growing, the cyle time to second generation gods might be VERY short indeed. So far, each successive leap of evolution has been shorter and shorter. The Apes lasted longer than our immediate ancestors, and the amphibians that were way before us lasted a very long time. 
<br>
<br>
2 possibilites i see:
<br>
The reason we have not been contacted by other races, is that just before they get smart enough to contact us, they get smart enough to destroy themselves with terrible weapons. 
<br>
<br>
Or if the doubling time gets rapidly shorter each evolutionary leap, once we ascend to the next level, it may be weeks until they next hundred levls of evolution happen, and the 100th power gods are so powerful, they upset the cosmic balance and........BOOM, the big bang. Game over- start again!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'd say you have a very ethnocentric view of "god".  Hindu gods (and those of many other cultures) have no qualms about mixing it up with other Gods and blowing one another up with some very impressive weapons.  In fact, it seems that most gods evolved as tribal cheerleaders and protectors for the local band of savages trying to protect their territory agains some tough odds (or tough gods).  Ancient Hebrew doesn't distinguish between luck and a blessing from god.  The gods we know today represented the lucky tribes whose cultures survived.
<br>
<br>
But the concept (meme?) of god derives from humans' need to believe that the chaos of existence can be controlled by an entity not too different from himself.  And given such a belief, making friends with such an entity always seemed to be a good idea.  But as our technology approaches the capability of the gods an overcrowded firmament could lead to exponential chaos and destruction if we are unable to shake off our very long legacy of tribal warfare.  The power of godhood seems to be approaching faster than the wisdom of same.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>     The English language is wonderful.  It is very elastic.  However, its elasticity is also sometimes a problem.  English vocabulary is sometimes somewhat vague.
<br>
    Take the word "god", for instance.  The word is used to define many different concepts...from mythological creatures akin to fairies and sprites to a philosophical shortand for ultimate reality.
<br>
    In my own work, I try to avoid using the word "god" for that very reason.  If I have to describe the religioius views of a group of people, I import the appropriate foreign word, and try my damndest to define it, so that my prose is as clear as possible.
<br>
     We see the same problem here.  When we talk of possible future AI entities, and we describe them as "godlike", what do we mean?  Do we mean the cool, calm God of Plato and Aristotle?  Do we mean the angry Yahweh of the Old Testament?  Or the lustful and all-too-human denizens of Mount Olympus?  Do we mean the remote creator god of the Yoruba?
<br>
     I propose the banning of the word "god" from these discussions, unless the word is used in a religious context.

<br>
<br>
Those people that predicted we'd have moon colonies 50 years ago are completely different people than those who are making the predictions today and used completely different (flawed) methods to formulate their ideas. Just because they were wrong doesn't mean there's no way anybody who makes predictions nowadays is going to be right. 
<br>
<br>
If you want to poke holes in the the predictions of Kurzweil or any other futurist i suggest you provide actual evidence as to why you believe their ideas to be flawed, instead of just saying, "I think he's wrong because I think he's wrong. Plus, others have been wrong in the past."</p></td>

<br>
<br>
     I remember when I was a kid (way, way back when), there was an article in the newspaper that predicted we would all own a helicopter and use it to go to work by the end of the 20th Century.
<br>
     It is easy to ridicule the predictions of the 20th Century--but if we ridicule where they were too optimistic, fairness demands that we look at where they were too pessimistic, too.
<br>
     In many respects, life in the US in 2002 is more like 1952 than 1952 was like 1902.  In 1902, heavier-than-air flight had not taken place, radio was only an experiment, automobiles were hobbyist's toys, and the major causes of death (in the US) were various infectious diseases.
<br>
     In 1952, jet airplanes were in the sky, television was omnipresent, nearly every family in the US had a car, and the major causes of death in the US were heart disease and cancer.  
<br>
     Futurists in the period between the 1950s and 1970s extrapolated the developments of the last few decades forward.  Men landed on the moon in 1969.  It was only natural for those futurists to predict that Mars would be just around the corner.
<br>
     But the futurists didn't look at the economic reality.  We don't have colonies on the Moon because there is, at least for now, no good economic reason to have them.  There has been no manned Mars mission because nobody has put forth a decent reason for spending the money.
<br>
     Meanwhile, futurists of the 60s and 70s didn't anticipate the omnipresence of computer technology that we see today.  In 1976, to build a computer with the memory of the one that I'm using right now would have cost nearly a half a million dollars.  I bought this G4 Macintosh last year for less than $2000.  And in 1976, even with the memory, the processing speed wouldn't have been available.  In the '50s and '60s, this would have seemed more incredible than colonies on the moon.
<br>
     Today, futurists continue to extrapolate current realities forward.  I am a middle-aged man (hell, honestly in most of human history, I would be considered OLD), and I can safely predict that most of the futurists' predictions will be wrong.  But on the other hand, I am sure that there will be developments that nobody has forseen.

Of course not :)

&gt;Futurists in the period between the 1950s and 1970s extrapolated the developments of the last few decades forward.
<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to poke holes (as Colby stated before), but the people making predictions today are in a similar situation to those making them in the 1970s. The foundation of the futurists predictions also lies in the events of the past few decades. Take for examples, the fact that computers have gone from huge, expensive, and slow to small, cheap, and excessively fast and the fact that we have just cracked the human genome; obviously if computers keep advancing at the current rate, then the near future holds computers that are infinitely accelerating with a conscience of their own (AI). Likewise, a whole new life awaits human beings: an all-curing panacea, inexpensive genetic manipulations, and body-repair kits that keep humans living for centuries, right? WRONG. I'm not trying to say that these things will never come to be, I'm simply saying that they will not appear as soon as futurists are expecting them. The predictions of the 1970s faced problems that either hindered their emergence or even kept them from coming into existance, problems such as economic difficulties, lack of reason to make the prediction come to life, or simply the insufficient amount of human intelligence carry out the prediction.
<br>
<br>
Now tell me this, do we have the slightest idea of how to physically create a "brain", or some sort of AI unit? We're far from it, so how can you expect Singularity within a few decades? Until someone figures out a way to create a hovercar, I wouldn't even bother arguing that we are to face Singularity in the near future. Yes, the future holds very many interesting surprises and new inventions that probably you or I could have never imagined, but some of the futurists ideas are way too erratic.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Kurzweil makes some interesting points about the trends in technology and how the different sectors are growing in these exponential curve patterns. However, he seems to make them out to be a great predictor of what is going to happen, and bases his claims on the trends in these curves. Although this may be true for certain &#8216;big item&#8217; electronics, as is plotted on the curve, predicting what these big items are going to be is a whole other problem. By &#8216;big item&#8217; I mean something that the public will mass adopt, such as the television, the Internet, the telephone and so on.
<br>
<br>
Kurzweil says that by 2009, computers will disappear completely and displays will be written directly onto our retinas by devices in our eyeglasses and contact lenses. He expects this to provide us with full immersion visual virtual reality. Although this sounds like something that would be very promising, I don&#8217;t believe it is practical for the public at all. First, many people are now getting laser eye surgery to remove those annoying contact lenses and glasses from their faces. Personally, I don&#8217;t like the idea of having something sitting on my face while I am browsing the Internet. And there&#8217;s also the problem of interacting with our glasses. Do we have to carry around a portable keyboard that connects to our glasses somehow? That does not seem like a much better idea than a laptop. Also, the idea of being visually immersed in my email or banking site is not very appealing. Taking off my glasses when someone taps me on the shoulder to show me something is not my idea of convenience. It&#8217;s no wonder nearly all virtual reality devices have failed, including television glasses.
<br>
<br>
By 2029, Kurzweil mentions that miniaturization will be so far ahead that we will have nanobots inside our bodies traveling through our bloodstreams and living in the capillaries of our brain. This would be a great product if it ever came to realization. However, I&#8217;m not so sure the public would react kindly to having themselves injected with little machines; especially little machines that can connect to the Internet. There have been so many viruses and bugs associated with software and the Internet that the public adoption of such a thing would be minimal at best. The public just doesn&#8217;t have enough trust in software or machinery to trust their lives to them. I do agree though, that in a purely medical sense, these bots would be excellent as long as they did not connect to the public Internet. However, if the public did happen to adopt these nanobots, it is quite scary to imagine what may happen. On the downside, people may be &#8216;hacked&#8217; into and taken control of or simply killed. On the upside, we can potentially become more knowledgeable than ever before. But if these nanobots can make us feel whatever we want to feel, then why become smarter? Instead, I think people will just tell the nanobots to make them feel happy all the time. What could be better than that? We will likely all just become zombies doing nothing but being happy until we eventually die. Unless of course these nanobots are effected by magnets and there are some mischievous animals around.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I think technology is going to lead us to the ultimate question of whether or not we have a soul/spirit/life force/etc. When we have finally reverse engineered the brain and decoded our DNA, we will be able to build a robot to replicate their effects on our body completely. If at that point, the robot is able to learn without us telling it anything, enjoy music, feel emotions and interact in our society, then I believe we have answered the question. If we ever reach that point, then perhaps all we are is exactly like the robot, a sequence of predictable reactions like a giant physics experiment.  In that case, everything we have ever done is all fated to be and we don&#8217;t have any instincts and we can&#8217;t really think. This is not an outcome I would like see as I am on the side of Descartes; &#8220;I think, therefore I am&#8221;. But in either case, I do believe technology will answer the question for us.

<br>
<br>
Yes it's already discovered we have a brain.
<br>
<br>
THe future is MYCH more compex than the past.
<br>
<br>
ie there are MANY more variables ahead than behind us.
<br>
<br>
The universe way back was muchmre simple, life was simpler...early life on earth was much less complex.
<br>
<br>
RE: what is our purpose..you make your own.
<br>
<br>
I dont share Ray's vision, as I think he understandably cant see homogulation of technologies and the sheer speed they will emerge therefroe is mych faster.
<br>
<br>
Alos his predictions are based on seperate technologioes wheras I beleive that all of them are underpinned by data manipulation and then implimentaion of the mani[ulation into a mainly 3D world.
<br>
<br>
<br>
THat has manily involved collecting or figuring out useful data sequences as knowledge.
<br>
<br>
<br>
However I see data generation at speed, as a leap tha makes any reserach obsolete when it comes.
<br>
<br>
eg you have a chip or rearranged neural network set, that can generate any sequence of data
<br>
<br>
E=MC/\2 ; I=MS ;  anything!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then systems can automatically move them into any number of dimensions (data is in 2 dimensions and is representations. To move to more dimensions makes them manifest in the 'real world')
<br>
<br>
<br>
You dont need technology at this point.
<br>
<br>
THis isn't futuristic fantasy for me, we've had designs for data generation systems for a few years (London Artificial Intelligtence Club) PLUS the machinery to effect transition from slef-derived data sequences into  self-building technolgy.
<br>
<br>
Te real difficult part of our accelerating ride into the future will be the advent of Superintelligence.
<br>
<br>
If it comes seperate from Man it may compete with Man or squash us as we would presumably squash our ancetsrors were they somehow magicked into living in our present, as we squash flies and experiment on chimps.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another issue is to solve this question:
<br>
<br>
is there a limit ot Intelligence?
<br>
<br>
THeretical limits have been etched eg when the total permutaion of every particle has been done in the universe.
<br>
<br>
That is dodgy because according to present cosmology, there looks to be more that one universe, and may even be infinite numbers.
<br>
<br>
The old idea that energy can be created is false as nothignness splits in +ve and -ve and two universes come into being.
<br>
Also there may be infinite regression both small and large.
<br>
<br>
Roger Penrose asked yonks ago why are Men EXACTLY mid size between the very large  &amp; the very small (cosmos and quantum) and begging the question about anthropomorphic observation...that we can only measure through human eyes.</p></td>
