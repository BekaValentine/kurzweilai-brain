<div class="TeaserText">Molecular nanotechnology manufacturing is coming soon. The economic value--and military significance--of a nanofactory will be immense. But if a well-designed plan is not in place, serious risks will very likely lead to military destruction, social or economic disruption or unnecessary human suffering on a large scale. Here's what needs to be done. </div>

<p><i>Originally published in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195300/http://www.fas.org/faspir/2003/v56n2/nanotech.htm" target="_blank">The 
              Federation of American Scientists Public Interest Report, Volume 
              56, Number 2, Summer 2003</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net <month day,="" year="">October 
              8, 2003.</month></i> </p>
<p>Despite claims to the contrary, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> manufacturing 
              is coming soon. Because it will be so useful, there will be strong 
              pressure to develop it as soon as possible, and past a certain point 
              it could happen quite rapidly. Macro-scale integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will improve product functionality, product design <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              and manufacturing speed and cost by orders of magnitude. This advance 
              may profoundly affect <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> and geopolitics, creating enormous 
              benefits and risks. It will be difficult to prepare adequately for 
              such a powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. For all these <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, molecular nanotechnology 
              should be a current topic in high-level policy and planning.</p>
<p>The word "nanotechnology" means several different things. 
              Today's nanotech <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is mainly concerned with building small 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s that have <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> properties. Such research adds steadily 
              to the technological toolbox, leading to improved products and occasionally 
              to new industries. Broadly speaking, such "structural" 
              nanotechnology creates risks comparable to other material <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              work. The second kind of nanotech is the science-fictional kind, 
              in which <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s can go anywhere and do anything but generally 
              do not conform to <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. </p>
<p>The third kind of nanotech, "molecular" nanotechnology 
              (MNT), is the focus of this article. MNT will combine <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> 
              and fabrication to produce precise <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and manufacturing systems 
              at the nanometer scale. Much of the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> science work has already 
              been done; what remains is the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering to create a working <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> 
              and then integrate many devices into a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale "nanofactory". 
            </p>
<p>Although most nanotech projects today focus on structural nanotechnology, 
              development of molecular nanotechnology will surely become a priority 
              within a few years. Full MNT capability may not be developed for 
              a decade or longer, but preparation for it should probably start 
              now.</p>
<p>The economic value&amp;#8212and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> significance-of a nanofactory 
              will be immense. Even a primitive model will be able to convert 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_aided_design_entry.html">CAD</a> files to products in a few hours. Duplicate nanofactories will 
              cost the same as any other nano-built product. The capital cost 
              of manufacturing will be negligible by today's standards, and manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> can be doubled in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of hours. </p>
<p>Nanocomputers will quickly replace <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> technologies; 
              whoever controls this technology will be able to produce more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              than the rest of the world combined. The ability to fit a <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> 
              (or sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>) into every piece of equipment, at no 
              extra manufacturing cost, will enable new kinds of products and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s. A nanotech-built surgical <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with a full sensor suite 
              could be smaller than a hypodermic needle. Development and deployment 
              of new weapons systems could be far faster and cheaper. Even the 
              initial products of an MNT nanofactory would be worth hundreds of 
              billions of dollars, and the potential for extremely rapid advancement 
              of nanotech fabrication capability means that no economic or political 
              unit can afford to allow a competitor to control the technology.</p>
<p>Much evidence has accumulated to indicate that molecular nanotech 
              manufacturing is possible. A decade ago, Nanosystems studied the 
              required chemistry and engineering in detail; not a single significant 
              error has been found so far. Cells, natural self-replicating machines, 
              make a variety of minerals including magnetite and silica&amp;#8212and 
              they do this under water, using chemical techniques four billion 
              years old. Mechanically guided covalent chemistry has already been 
              accomplished with a scanning probe microscope. </p>
<p>The best arguments of intelligent critics regarding the feasibility 
              of nanotech manufacturing have been refuted in detail. There is 
              little doubt that a small self-replicating system can be built. 
              There is strong theoretical support for basing such a system on 
              mechanochemistry. And given the variety of buckytubes, <a class="thought" href="entries/buckyball_entry.html">buckyball</a>s, 
              buckyhorns, and other graphitic and diamondoid shapes that have 
              been manufactured or found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, it's likely that a self-replicating 
              nanoscale machine based on 3D covalent <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> mechanochemistry will 
              be relatively straightforward to design. </p>
<p>A goal or milestone of MNT is an "assembler": a self-contained 
              mechanical system capable of fabricating duplicates of itself from 
              simple chemicals. Several researchers have investigated the requirements 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a> and Ralph Merkle are due to 
              publish two books on the topic in 2003 and 2004. A single assembler 
              is not very useful, since it can only make very small products. 
            </p>
<p>However, if a nanofactory containing many assemblers can combine 
              the tiny products (nanoblocks) into a single large product, the 
              result would be extremely useful. It has been claimed that this 
              will take years to achieve, blunting the <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> of MNT assemblers. 
              However, work by the author demonstrates that a useful nanofactory 
              can be pre-designed, so that building and <a class="thought" href="entries/debugging_entry.html">debugging</a> the design might 
              take only a few months. Once the first assembler is built, a fully 
              functional nanofactory-and the nanofactory's products-may follow 
              in well under a year.</p>
<p>Although design at the atomic level will not be easy, a nanotech 
              product designer will not need to worry about that&#8212;just as 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> engineer does not think about the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s in the 
              computer. A small and pre-tested <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of nanomachines, built into 
              nanoblocks, can be combined in many ways to make a vast array of 
              products. By designing with nanoblocks instead of atoms, a product 
              designer loses little flexibility, and gains simplicity and reliability. 
              Nanoblocks can be fastened together in a process called "convergent 
              assembly." The joining process uses a single <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, requiring 
              only simple robotics, and the joints retain most of the strength 
              of the base material. A single nanoblock is big enough to contain 
              an assembler, computer or motor, and small enough to be built by 
              a single assembler in a few hours. A nanofactory built of nanoblocks 
              can build and assemble nanoblocks into a huge range of products-including 
              duplicates of itself.</p>
<p>Such a powerful technology introduces many risks. One obvious risk 
              is an unstable arms race. Rapid development of new weapons technologies 
              means less opportunity for surveillance and more uncertainty about 
              the enemy's <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> capabilities. Weapons could be more powerful 
              and far "smarter"&#8212;imagine the combined capability 
              of a million unmanned aerial vehicles with on-board <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> matching 
              and navigation capability. </p>
<p>Many factors tempt a preemptive strike if a temporary advantage 
              is gained in an MNT arms race. The likely outcome of a strike would 
              be either global domination requiring Draconian measures including 
              denial of technology, or a series of increasingly destructive high-tech 
              conflicts. Once weapons, or the systems that produce them, are dispersed, 
              preventing guerrilla use of them would require inspection of literally 
              every cubic millimeter, or continuous surveillance of entire populations.</p>
<p>Availability of unregulated MNT manufacturing could create several 
              serious problems. Criminal and terrorist activity would benefit 
              from smaller, more capable products. Small, widely available, cheap 
              surveillance devices would allow an unprecedented invasion of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, criminals and neighbors. Cheap microscopic products 
              can lead to widespread microscopic litter, with possible environmental 
              or health consequences. Small self-contained foraging self-replicating 
              systems ("gray goo") appear to be theoretically possible, 
              and might be released by terrorists, saboteurs or even irresponsible 
              hobbyists. </p>
<p>Though probably less dangerous than all-out war with MNT-built 
              weapons, such devices could be significantly more destructive than 
              invasive <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> because they would have no natural enemies. 
              Many of these problems can best be addressed by widespread environmental 
              monitoring, but the required systems may not be deployed quickly 
              or universally. </p>
<p>Molecular manufacturing may cause substantial economic disruption. 
              Several of today's sectors, including manufacturing, shipping and 
              raw materials, would be disrupted or outmoded. Fully automated self-duplicating 
              factories would reduce the value of both capital and labor, and 
              drive down the cost of goods. Large disparity between cost and value 
              would provide strong incentive for protectionism and anticompetitive 
              policy, resulting in widespread black markets. The <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a> 
              industry is already experiencing similar problems; MNT may extend 
              them to most manufactured products. </p>
<p>Simplistic attempts to regulate MNT could create more problems 
              than they solve. Attempts to restrict proliferation may generate 
              oppressive or even abusive regulation. Today, billions of people 
              live in sickness or <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a> for lack of a few basic products like 
              water filters, mosquito netting and computers. All of this would 
              be easy to produce with MNT-based manufacturing, but recent US <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> 
              blocking a WTO attempt to provide affordable <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s to 
              poor nations indicates that the same could happen with MNT. </p>
<p>A population denied <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to lifesaving benefits of cheap molecular 
              manufacturing due to protectionist economic policy or paranoid security 
              policy (or even just blatantly overcharged) would have a strong 
              incentive to steal, duplicate or "crack" the technology. 
              Independent MNT development <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s multiply many of the risks, 
              including the risk of necessary regulations and technical restrictions 
              being bypassed. Since nanofactories will be self-contained, incredibly 
              valuable and easily concealed, a black market in nanofactories would 
              be difficult to prevent. Ultimately, control of the technology could 
              be lost, and regions with excessive regulation may be sidelined.</p>
<p>In developing MNT, it may be that the safest course is a single, 
              international development effort, leading to a technology that can 
              be widely distributed and carefully administered&#8212;with tight 
              technological controls in place to limit its use. This would provide 
              an infrastructure for rapid humanitarian relief with basic products, 
              profit-making with other products, and perhaps even arms control-if 
              nations could be restrained from developing independent, unmonitored 
              MNT capability. </p>
<p>If this is in fact the best approach, the need for action is even 
              more urgent. A nation with an entrenched MNT development program 
              may be less likely to join or support an international development 
              effort. It will not be easy to convince military and political leaders, 
              captains of industry and environmental and social watchdogs that 
              the best course of action involves giving up some control in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              to retain some control. </p>
<p>MNT development appears inevitable for two reasons. The first is 
              the immense utility of MNT. Even if public pressure prevented it 
              from being used in consumer goods, various militaries would not 
              hesitate to develop it as a tremendous aid to military capability. 
              In conventional conflicts, the improvements in logistics, <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, 
              development and cost would give an overwhelming advantage to the 
              possessor of such technology, both in preparation and in actual 
              combat. </p>
<p>The second reason is the increasing ease of development. Enabling 
              technologies are improving each year. New families of structural 
              chemicals are being discovered. New fabrication technologies, new 
              nanoscale imaging technologies and increased computer power for 
              mechanochemical simulation will rapidly decrease the difficulty 
              of building an assembler-and thus a nanofactory. Today, a successful 
              program might require billions of dollars and several years. </p>
<p>A decade from now it might be possible for only $100 million, within 
              the reach of many corporations and nations. At that point, if MNT 
              is not already widely available, it will be developed in multiple 
              labs around the world-and will be almost impossible to control.</p>
<p>By encompassing all phases of production from chemical processing 
              to final assembly, MNT manufacturing can be far more flexible than 
              any other single technology, with the possible exception of programmable 
              computers. A few other technologies may be equally dangerous, but 
              are easier to control. </p>
<p>Nuclear technology can only be used for a few things&amp;#8212bombs, 
              power generation, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> treatment&#8212;so it has been possible 
              for a fairly small international effort to keep control of various 
              aspects of this technology. <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a> is flexible in its <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>, 
              but biotech products have been difficult to engineer. Conventional 
              rapid prototyping systems will improve gradually; it will be a while 
              before they can make complete products, and even longer before they 
              can cheaply duplicate themselves. </p>
<p>A single technology with the programmability and speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              computers, the chemical flexibility of biotechnology, the military 
              potential of nuclear technology or airplanes and the utility of 
              very advanced rapid prototyping, will bring many changes. The variety 
              of potential problems, in economic, military, political, humanitarian 
              and environmental spheres, indicates that no simple solution can 
              work. A balance must be struck between national defense and arms 
              control; between capitalist practice and social needs and between 
              unrestricted private use and oppressive restriction. These issues 
              will not be easy to solve. </p>
<p>The final stages of development will occur too quickly for solutions 
              to evolve. If a well-designed plan is not in place before this happens, 
              one or more serious risks will very likely lead to military destruction, 
              social or economic disruption or unnecessary human suffering on 
              a large scale. Each major risk should be studied in detail. Public 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> and discussion should take place. Policy makers need to 
              be informed. </p>
<p>There is very little doubt that MNT manufacturing will be developed 
              within the next three decades, and it may be as soon as ten years. 
              It seems likely that some sort of international administration will 
              be necessary. Any large administrative body, especially one requiring 
              complex international cooperation, will take time to design, fund 
              and create. All this may require more than a decade. A large international 
              development effort may also be necessary, and would have to begin 
              even sooner. </p>
<p>These factors indicate that preparation for molecular nanotechnology 
              should become a current topic in high-level policy and planning.</p>

  This is already happening in that Far Eastern peasants are assembling these items instead of nanoassemblers. Electronics, especially computers have been drastically dropping in price on an accelerating pace for the past 15 years. It is very obviously doing that in the last 3-4 years. Even household appliances are beginning to share this trend. 
<br>
<br>
There are notable exceptions! Houses and cars are two goods that have an entrenched commercial infrastructure that needs to disappear.
<br>
Otherwise, a car might be 50% cheaper, and a house, 67%, excluding the land. I can't wait for this to happen, social disruption be damned! Do we really need to employ people who profit solely from information friction? 
<br>
<br>
  I'm researching the purchase of a new car, and I'm appalled at the inefficiency and outright thievery inherent in the process! I won't even discuss the organized crime syndicates that masquerade as realtors. Those who own property and expect to make money while doing nothing are equally guilty. I am gleefully awaiting the supposed collapse of the housing bubble and the ultimate, permanent price deflation on physical goods. When enough items can be made for $10 and this fact becomes common knowledge, the ability of salesdroids to charge $200 for it will evaporate, regardless of how well they are dressed!</p></td>

<br>
The only reason why any government doesn't pursue every last freethinker "troublemaker" in the nation is private gun ownership and/or a lack of resources.  Why should they tolerate a libertarian party (or individual independant candidates) that wants less government (especially when they point out how little value and how much suffering government causes)?
<br>
<br>
If I were you, I would feel safer knowing that the regulatory arm of the government was clueless about nano, and responsible private individuals are the ones on the cutting edge (just as they are in the United States gun culture today).  If the government has the ability to regulate molecular manufacturing before it is widely established, it will be deemed "too dangerous for the masses".
<br>
<br>
At that point, the government will push to centralize control of the nano-engineering talent.  Just after they do this, they will slaughter their opposition (quietly, so the scientists don't turn against them).  History has shown us clearly that this is what we should expect to deal with.
<br>
<br>
Why pine for another FDA?  (Through their sloth and incompetence alone, they sentence thousands to death every day)  At worst, we might get a 'ministry of science' that will wield political power, controlling thought.  At best another FDA-type regulatory body that is far from the cutting edge, slowing down research, development, and marketing.</p></td>

I think engineering, in the future, will be concentrated on how to program materials to manufacture themselves -- just as people, plants and animals are programmed with DNA to self assemble.  Once we know how to use the code, I see no limit to  what we can design and get it to produce iteself.  IF you think low wages in developing countries is putting Americans out of work, just imagine what will happen to them when we develop the technology of molecular self assembly.  What we'd better get cracking on is the education of future generations so they can work in the design fields instead of the manufacturing fields.  Manufacturing will be for people who live in backward societies.</p></td>

Jobs will be lost but also products will be very cheap. I dont know how (and  im interested to see) society will respond.  It will probably come with a storm.  Suggestions are made that as soon as the first limited molecular assemblers are created  they will be used to create more advanced assemblers and factories of assemblers.

The Robot Within
<br>
<br>
By Philip Ball 
<br>
THEY call it "global ecophagy". That 's "eating the Earth" to you and me. Rumour has it that this is what replicating nanostructures might do, and according to one estimate, they could gobble up the entire planet in about three hours flat. 
<br>
<br>
So it 's a mystery why the announcement by German chemist G nter von Kiedrowski last December that he is on the brink of making self-replicating objects just nanometres across has passed off so quietly. No one batted an eyelid when von Kiedrowski and his team at the Ruhr University of Bochum reported they can copy the chemical information in complex molecules that are designed to assemble themselves into pre-defined structures. 
<br>
<br>
The idea is that these structures might one day be assembled into tiny robots nanobots that could perform incredibly precise tasks. They might prop up failing immune systems, for example, by helping to distinguish friendly cells from dangerous foreign invaders, or help construct miniature electronic circuits. 
<br>
<br>
Whereas the nanobots of sci-fi nightmares are implausible little devices that mine atoms from the environment and use them to build more nano-brothers and sisters, von Kiedrowski 's versions are based on the tried-and-tested molecular replicator DNA. Hisprototype replicators rely on the same principles that enable DNA to copy itself to pass on their own assembly instructions to a new generation. Why go to all the bother of designing replication systems from scratch, von Kiedrowski asks, when nature already has a good way of doing it?

Im am interested to know whether Ray has considered the CONTINUAL doubling of the exponential rate (as i know he has mentioned that the exponential rate is doubling).  I think Rays predictions are based on exponential rate and thus he would be overestimating the time taken to make these breakthroughs.  
<br>
Though i do not confess to understanding the technology behind nano tech i do understand the trends of growth.
<br>
I just read an interesting article by CRN where for the first time they have described a complete nanofactory in detail.  Also that "every aspect of nanofactory design other than the fabricator mechanism is well within the capability of todays engineering practice". The full story is listed in the news section of this website.
<br>
CRN (Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder)are cocerned that it will arrive too soon before adequate means for controlling it are in place.  
<br>
CRN have created original and thought provoking ideas on the subject of regulation.  So check out their site if you are interested.</p></td>

"Nanotech-built antipersonnel weapon capable of seeking" ? ... sounds like the typical 'seeker' robot in today's SF. So it seems Phoenix waivers on his idea of what is possible and what is not, from one publication to the next.
<br>
<br>
"but preparation for it should probably start now." Probably? I think it must, and Phoenix would agree. I wonder why he didn't say 'must', his argument would be more authoritative and stronger if he did.</p></td>

<br>
I wonder what would happen if, say, Japan were the first country to reach this goal. Don't get me wrong; I love Japan and Japanese culture. But, their fantasy of superiority, as evidenced by their myth-laden history school texts, has not completely vanished, and they've been aggressors before. 
<br>
<br>
Or let's say someone with both the position and the religious of General Boykin
<br>
[  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195300/http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;edition=us&amp;q=boykin" target="_blank">http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;edition=us&amp;q=boy  kin</a>  ] were to take an interest of American scientists' possession of such technology. Equally scary.
<br>
<br>
As Chris Phoenix' article suggests, this is all going to be hard to regulate. Before the beloved Singularity comes (if it comes), there are some chaotic times ahead. Am I being alarmist?
<br>
<br>
If I were find a small device bearing MNT in my basement, I think that would be the best for everyone. I promise to you all right now, that I would only use it for the betterment of mankind.</p></td>

<br>
Who says it'll be developed by governments?  Ideally, they'll be clueless, because it'll be people with too much personal integrity to work for the government who get there first.  Why do I say 'ideally'? -Because government's sole proper domain is the use of force -and using nanotechnology as a weapon would give nearly any government absolute power over its people (and any others it wished to conquer).
<br>
<br>
Government attracts the kind of people who want to control other people, and who can manipulate the willfully ignorant majority.  Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Causescu, Mussolini, Amin, Hussein, etc...  We'll get to experience a much more effective version of these regimes if a government is the first to control MNT.  Just think: everyone who's ever effectively complained about paying taxes -dead of something that looks like cancer and can't be proven to be otherwise.  Oh well!  Nobody cares!  -As long as they keep paying their taxes and keep their mouths shut, the trains they see every day won't be carrying them to the chambers.
<br>
<br>
With nanotechnology, our parasite class will have a window of opportunity to perfect itself beyond the moral limits currently imposed by the remnants of our Bill of Rights.  
<br>
<br>
If any of this moves you, you can get a head start on preventing effective totalitarianism by voting libertarian:
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195300/http://www.lp.org/" target="_blank">http://www.lp.org</a>   --it's the very very least you can do.  (And if you're like most people you'd rather vote for a killer because he fleetingly promises you a handout than vote for a liberator who will actually give you your freedom.)
<br>
<br>

<br>
All of these 200 million innocent people died because an ignorant majority didn't do everything they could to stop their socialist/fascist/statist dictators from seizing absolute power.  Hitler's nazis operated with the blessing of the ignorant and anti-enlightenment German citizens.  What made them anti-enlightenment?  -They believed in collective rule of the individual, and of subordinating the individual to the "greater good".
<br>
<br>
-But really, the greater good is every citizen acting in his own self interest, to the best of their intelligence.  The free market might not be perfect, but least under actual capitalism (not protectionist fascism), mass murder is avoided, and productivity gradually increases.
<br>
<br>
Ask most US citizens what they think about the Waco massacre in Texas, where the government killed a bunch of innocent people, on national tv, with no trial, after firing on them first and without provocation.  If you're in New York City, most people sympathize with the slaughterers, and if you're in Fairbanks, Alaska, most people sympathize with the slaughtered.
<br>
<br>
Which city casts more votes?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Proponents of Molecular Nanotechnology (MNT) manufacturing claim that the technology will be revolutionary like the Internet in its effects on society and the economy, yet unlike anything we have seen so far. But we have heard things like this before ' for the Internet, for wireless technology, for Virtual reality, for any new technology for that matter. Surely these technologies have affected our world to varying degrees but the Internet has not been apocalyptic so far. Though the Internet has brought its problems, it also has unforeseen benefits that society today is probably not willing to give up. Electricity brought environmental problems that we had not expected. Does that mean we will stop using it? No, even after almost a century, we are trying to find a solution. Similarly each change will bring good things and bad things for our society, and the way to face it would be to work to find a solution.
<br>
MNT offers many potential benefits for our society, albeit at a cost ' the risk of radical changes to our society's core. The Industrial Revolution transformed the 19th century world from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one. It was a time of dramatic change and innovations, but those were changes that have led to our current world. Even then there were opponents of technology who worried about loss of income and fewer jobs. This was seen again in the 20th century when the economy was being automated and computers were being used to replace human services. Those changes did not bring the end of our civilization, rather enriched it. I expect to see similar reactions when nanotechnology comes in the mainstream, but I also expect that people will have other things to do ' maybe trying to find ways to harness the potential of MNT. Even though optimists say that nanotechnology is coming, and coming very soon, it is hard to believe that it will change everything at once. It is quite reasonable to assume that the technology will be implemented in phases and won't happen overnight, after all 'Rome was not built in a day'.
<br>
We are living in an age of transformation ' the economy is changing from manufacturing to a service oriented one, and future innovations will require us to keep up with those changes. After all, that's what evolution is all about ' keep up or get left out. Every time civilization takes a step forward, there will be some who were happy with the way things were and they don't want anything to change, while others will want things to change. Most of my parent's and grandparent's generation complains about how fast-paced life is now and how they lived in much 'simpler' and 'happier' times. The fact is that pessimists will always be over cautious and techno-optimists will always try to 'better' our world. Human nature is such that we are always cautious of the unknown, and will fight change as far as possible.
<br>
That is not to say that we shouldn't be prepared to deal with the issues that will arise as nanotechnology becomes a common phenomenon. The solution to such a situation would not be simple and may require as much effort as the technology itself needed. It doesn't necessarily imply government or a particular state's control. Instead we need to rethink our current nation-state model to come up with something that treats all humans equally so that future technologies don't widen the gap between peoples of different regions. I believe that our society will undergo an upheaval like the French Revolution which will change the way we view ourselves ' not citizens of a country but of a global village. This change is necessary in view of global technologies such as the Internet and MNT, and will happen sooner or later. Such a model will encourage utilization of available resources and technologies for positive purposes and not to destroy 'enemies'.
<br>
Realistically speaking, people like Hitler and Alexander will always find a way to fulfil their goals regardless of the age or available technologies. Even a thousand years ago, people were fighting yet surviving. They are still doing that. Possibly they will continue doing so for the next thousand years or more. Human nature won't change. But that should not stop us from actively seeking improvements and change.

<br>
<br>
We seem to be patterns of cosmic particles.
<br>
<br>
we know that all patterns break up eventually, usually in the short term, and change into something else.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt that life could sustain it's pattern indefinately, and that entropy would occur in 10 20 years at most from now.
<br>
<br>
MNT pr SAI or something else is going to happen if it's possible.
<br>
<br>
But to beleive we can control it is monomaniac in it's optomism.
<br>
<br>
it will run it's own blind goals and probably burn out quickley
