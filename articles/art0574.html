<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>Thomas Watson, the chairman of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, observed in 1943 that "I think 
              there is a world market for maybe five <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s." In 1997 there 
              were 80 million <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s sold. To understand his impressive 
              lack of vision, remember that early <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> large <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s</li>
<li>housed in specialized rooms</li>
<li>used by skilled operators</li>
<li>for fixed industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s</li>
<li>with a limited market</li>
</ul>
<p>From there it was too hard to conceive of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that could 
              fit on a desk without crushing it, much less on a lap. Unseen beyond 
              that horizon in packaging lay the revolutionary implications of 
              personalization.</p>
<p>Once <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s became small enough and cheap enough for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s 
              to own them, their application became a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of personal preference 
              rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> policy. Big companies have an unerring knack 
              for doing dumb things because so many people are involved in specifying 
              and evaluating what someone else does that it's all too easy to 
              forget to think. Once it became possible for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s to write 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s or configure packages to reflect their <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> needs, 
              then instead of marveling at someone else's stupidity they could 
              do something about it. This represented a loss of control for the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> companies that were accustomed to prescribing what <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> their customers would use; in return, the market for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s grew to something more than five <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>Now consider <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools. These are the large mills and lathes 
              and drills that are used in factories for fabrication. For the ordinary 
              person, they are about as exciting as <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. In fact, 
              they really are quite similar. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> tools are</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>large <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s</li>
<li>housed in specialized rooms</li>
<li>used by skilled operators</li>
<li>for fixed industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s</li>
<li>with a limited market</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound familiar? Big companies use big <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to make things we 
              may not really want. Personal computing has not gone far enough: 
              it lets us shape our <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> environment, but not our physical environment. 
              By giving <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s the means to manipulate atoms as easily as they 
              manipulate bits, we can bring the same kind of personalization to 
              the rest of our lives. With the benefit of hindsight, plus a peek 
              into the laboratory to see what's coming, this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> around we can 
              do better than Thomas Watson and recognize the impending arrival 
              of the Personal Fabricator.</p>
<p>One of the eeriest <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s in my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> came when I first opened 
              the door of a 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> and took out a part that I had just seen 
              on the screen of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. It violated the neat boundary between 
              what is inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and what is outside. In a strange way, 
              holding the part felt almost like touching the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>A 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> peripheral like any other, but instead 
              of putting ink on paper, or <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on a disk, it puts materials together 
              to make <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. Working with a 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> engages our visceral 
              connection to the physical world, which has been off-limits for 
              so long whenever a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is involved. When I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              in my lab, people would come by just to touch the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and the 
              parts that it produced. Watching them, I could almost hear the mental 
              gears grinding as they began to think about how they could make 
              what they wanted, instead of purchasing what someone else <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              they wanted. If a static shape can have that kind of impact, then 
              I'm not sure how people will react when the output from the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              is able to walk out of it. Because we're also <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to print 
              sensors, motors, and <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>.</p>
<p>To appreciate just how inevitable and <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant personal fabrication 
              is, I had to retrace the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of computing in this new <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>. 
              When I arrived at MIT in the early '90s, you couldn't tell that 
              it had been a pioneer in manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The few remaining 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shops on campus were in a sorry state, holdovers from the 
              Iron Age in the midst of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Age. The campus had long 
              since gone <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>. Forlorn <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools were left neglected by 
              the throngs of students clustering around the latest <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>As I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to create a lab that could free computing from its 
              confining boxes, I knew that we would need to be equally adept at 
              shaping things as well as ideas. This meant that we would need to 
              start with a good <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop. A traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop is a 
              wonderful place in which a skilled machinist can make almost anything. 
              Since this one would be in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, where neither the people 
              nor the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are traditional, this shop would need to be much 
              more easily <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible.</p>
<p>The most versatile tool to be added was a milling <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. These 
              come in two flavors. Manual ones are designed to be used by hand; 
              a part to be <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>d is fixed to a bed that is moved under the 
              rotating cutting tool by long lead screws turned by hand. Numerically 
              controlled (NC) mills are designed to be run by a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>; the 
              bed and sometimes the head are moved by motors under <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> control. 
              The operator of an NC mill stands at a control panel that can be 
              some distance from the workpiece, usually with a cryptic <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> 
              that makes it difficult to do much more than start and stop the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted both less and more than a conventional NC mill. Whatever 
              we bought had to have a direct mechanical linkage that could be 
              used manually. The feeling of the torque and vibration through the 
              handles provides essential insight into how well a tool is cutting, 
              which is invaluable for beginners and <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant also for experts 
              working with unfamiliar materials. This is lost when the mill is 
              controlled from a remote console.</p>
<p>Next, the mill needed to have a graphical <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> that made it 
              simple to specify shapes right on the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, because the only 
              things more unfriendly than typical NC controllers are the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers use to design parts. Finally, the mill had to be 
              on speaking terms with the building's <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, to make it easy to 
              transfer designs from the many types of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in use.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> tool distributors laughed when I described what I was looking 
              for. I knew I had a problem when I got the same reaction from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              tool manufacturers. Over and over, I was told that I had to choose 
              between the immediacy of a manual <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> and the power of a numerical 
              one.</p>
<p>As I traveled around the world, I started to make detours to visit 
              manufacturers. The turning point in my quest came on a trip to see 
              one of the largest European makers of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools. The day started 
              with them proudly showing me their products&#8212;huge mills that 
              cost $100,000, required skilled technicians to operate and maintain 
              them, and were difficult to use for anything but repetitive <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s. 
              I then sat down with their eminent director of development to discuss 
              my requirements. As I spoke, he became increasingly agitated. Soon 
              he was pounding on the table and shouting that I must not ask for 
              such a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>At first I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. As he continued 
              to hold forth, I felt like I was being transported back a few decades 
              to reenact a familiar scene. I wanted to buy a PC; he wanted to 
              sell me a <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>. He was making all of the same arguments for 
              why small <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could never replace big <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s: machining/computing 
              requires expert skills, NC mills/<a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s have narrow markets, 
              personal <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are toys that can't do serious work. We parted 
              agreeing that we lived on different <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I came back and found what I was looking for in my 
              backyard. A company on Boston's Route 128, Compumachine, started 
              with a nice manual milling <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, added motors so that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              as well as a person could control it, then put on a keyboard and 
              screen to run it. Instead of the usual impenetrable industrial controller, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> was a familiar <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tool industry this was viewed as dangerous lunacy, 
              because the inevitable <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> crashes could cause real crashes of 
              the mill, destroying it if not its operator. What makes the mill 
              safe is an illusion: the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> only appears to be in charge. 
              There's a layer of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry between it and the mill that actually 
              issues the commands, monitoring everything the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> requests 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to prevent anything unsafe from happening.</p>
<p>An NC mill is such a specialized piece of equipment that it usually 
              has to earn its keep with manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s. Putting one 
              in the hands of <a class="thought" href="entries/graphic_design_entry.html">graphic design</a>ers, and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers, and musicians, 
              led to all sorts of clever things getting made in a way that would 
              never occur to a traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er. The mill was used to build 
              a parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with processors embedded in triangular tiles 
              that could be snapped together in 2'D or 3'D sculptures, exchanging 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and power through the connections. Miniature architectural 
              models were created to serve as tangible icons for a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. 
              The success of these kinds of projects led me to wonder if physical 
              fabrication could be made still simpler to reach still more people.</p>
<p>An alternative to making something by machining away parts that 
              you don't want is to assemble it by adding parts that you do. Lego 
              blocks are a familiar example of additive fabrication that make 
              it possible to quickly and easily build impressive <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s. There's 
              a surprising amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> in this apparently simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>; 
              Lego has spent decades getting the bricks just right, <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ing 
              with the size of the posts, the angle of the faces, the hardness 
              and finish of the plastic. The earliest bricks look almost like 
              the current bricks, but these ongoing incremental improvements are 
              what make them so satisfying to play with.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been around kids building with Legos understands 
              the power of a child's drive to create. This is on display at the 
              Legoland near Lego's headquarters in Denmark, an amusement park 
              filled with spectacular Lego creations. There are Lego cities with 
              buildings bigger than the kids admiring them, giant Lego <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, 
              Lego mountain ranges. What's so amazing about this place is the 
              kids' reaction. There are none of the things we've come to expect 
              that children need to be entertained, no whizzy rides or flashy 
              graphics or omnipresent soundtracks. Just great <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s. And 
              the kids are more engaged than any group I've ever seen, spending 
              awed hours professionally appraising the marvels on display. The 
              people who work for Lego, and who play with Lego, share a deep aesthetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the pleasure of a nicely crafted <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, Professor Mitch Resnick has one of the world's 
              most extensive Lego collections. For years his group has been working 
              to extend the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of Lego from form to function, embedding sensors 
              and actuators as well as <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s for computing and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, 
              so that the bricks can act and react. At first, conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              were externally <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>d to the Lego set; now they've been shrunken 
              down to fit into a brick. These let children become mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers, with the same comfortable <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> they've known 
              for years. Kids have used the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to make creatures that can 
              dance and interact, to animate their fantasy worlds, and to automate 
              their homes. This <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has been so successful that it has now 
              left the lab and become a new line of products for Lego. The only 
              surprise, which isn't really a surprise, is that grown-ups are buying 
              the sets for themselves as well as for their kids.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is Festo. Festo is to industrial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers as Lego is to kids; they make the actuators and controllers 
              that are used to build factories. In fact, Lego's factories are 
              full of Festo parts making the Lego parts. Festo also has a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              for prototyping new factories and teaching people to design and 
              run them. This is Lego for grown-ups. When I first brought its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              into my lab there was a rush of ooh's and aah's, because it could 
              do what Lego couldn't: make large precise <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s. The hefty, 
              shiny metal parts spoke to their serious purpose.</p>
<p>Following detailed instructions, with some effort, we used this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to put together an assembly line to make pencil sharpeners. 
              And that's all we did. People left as quickly as they appeared, 
              because it soon became clear that it was too hard to play with something 
              this exact. Too many specialized parts are needed to do any one 
              thing, assembling them is too much work, and interactively <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              the industrial controllers is all but hopeless.</p>
<p>Between Lego and Festo the needs of children and industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers 
              are covered. Mitch and I began to wonder about everyone else. Most 
              people don't make most of the things that they use, instead choosing 
              products from a menu selected for them by other people. Might it 
              be possible to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that would let ordinary people build 
              things they cared about? We called this "Any Thing" and <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a 
              project to develop it. Drawing on the lessons from Lego and Festo, 
              this kit would build electrical connections for <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and power into 
              every mechanical joint, so that these capabilities did not need 
              to be added on later. The parts would snap together in precise <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s, 
              without requiring tools. And it would be made out of new composite 
              materials, to be <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, strong, and cheap. Armed with these guiding 
              principles, we first tried out <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models of the parts, then 
              prepared to start building it. At this point we called a design 
              review meeting. We filled a room with as many alternative construction 
              kits as we could find for comparison, and then added as many people 
              and as much pizza as we could fit in. The night took many surprising 
              turns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Any Thing had been developed entirely by a bunch 
              of geeky guys (like me). This was the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> any women had seen 
              it. One of the first questions that one of my <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> colleagues 
              asked was what it was going to feel like; our jaws dropped when 
              we realized that we had designed bones without <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about skin. 
              As the night proceeded and people played with the various <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
              construction <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, they were uniformly frustrated by the nuisance 
              of chasing around to find all of the fiddly little bits they needed 
              to complete whatever they were working on. The Any Thing vision 
              of personal fabrication necessarily entailed a personal warehouse 
              to store an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>y of all the required <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s.</p>
<p>The more we talked, the more we realized that the most interesting 
              part of Any Thing was not our proposed design, it was the 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              we were using to prototype it. Three-dimensional printing takes 
              additive fabrication to its logical conclusion. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> tools make 
              parts by milling, drilling, cutting, turning, grinding, sanding 
              away unwanted material, requiring many separate <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s and a 
              lot of waste. Just as a Lego <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> is used to construct something 
              by adding bricks, a 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> also builds parts by adding material 
              where it is needed instead of subtracting it where it is not. But 
              where Lego molds the raw materials to mass-produce bricks in the 
              factory, in a 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> the raw materials are formed on demand 
              right in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this. One <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> aims a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> into 
              a vat of epoxy to cure it just where it is needed, another spreads 
              layers of powder and squirts a binder where it should stick together, 
              and our Stratasys 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> extrudes out a bead of material like 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-controlled glue gun that leaves a three'dimensional trail. 
              These techniques can all go from a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> model to something that 
              you can hold, without requiring any special operator training or 
              setup. This convenience is significantly decreasing the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it 
              takes companies to make product prototypes. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are currently 
              expensive and slow, but like any promising machinist they are steadily 
              becoming more efficient.</p>
<p>As interesting as 3D printing is, it's still like using a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> to 
              execute a <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. The end result is not very different 
              from what can be made with conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools, it's just 
              the path to get there that is simpler. The real question posed by 
              our Any Thing design review was whether 3D printing could be extended 
              as Lego had been to incorporate sensors and actuators, computing 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. If we could do this, then instead of forcing 
              people to use their infinitely flexible and <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s to 
              browse through catalogs reflecting someone else's guesses at what 
              they want, they could directly output it. Appliances with left-handed 
              controls, or ones with easy-to-read large type, would become <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s 
              of personal <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> rather than idle wishes.</p>
<p>This is the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of the personal fabricator, the PF, the missing 
              mate to the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. It would be the one <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that could make all 
              your others, a practical embodiment of the perennial <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>-fiction 
              staple of a universal <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> output <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. As we began to dare 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of developing such a thing, we realized that we had been 
              working on it all along.</p>
<p>Joe Jacobson's <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> book project was already 
              laying down the conductors, insulators, and <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a>s needed 
              to make <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s on paper. Just as an ink-jet <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> has cartridges 
              with different-colored inks, it is possible to provide a <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              with more types of input materials so that it can also deposit structural 
              shapes and active <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. One of the first successes was a printed 
              motor that used carefully timed electric fields to move a piece 
              of paper. If your desk was covered by such a <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> then it could 
              file your work away for you at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> industry is trying to reach this goal of integrating 
              sensors, <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and actuators, by cutting out tiny little <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with the fabrication processes that are currently used 
              to make <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s. This idea is called <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a>, Micro-Electro-Mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s. Although the industry sees this as an area with great <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              prospects, <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> fabrication has the same problem as <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools. <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s are designed by specialists and then 
              mass-produced using expensive equipment. The desktop version could 
              be called PEMS, Printed Electro-Mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s. Unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a>, 
              it can make people-size <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s rather than microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              and the things are made where and when they are needed rather than 
              being distributed from a factory.</p>
<p>A PEMS <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> requires two kinds of inputs, atoms and bits. Along 
              with the raw materials must come the instructions for how they are 
              to be placed. One possibility is for these to be distributed over 
              the Net. Instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing an <a class="thought" href="entries/applet_entry.html">applet</a> to run in a Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>, 
              a "fabblet" could be <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed to the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> to specify an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>. 
              This would significantly lower the threshold for a company or an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> to sell a new product, since all that gets sent is the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about how to make it. But it stills leaves people selecting 
              rather than designing what they want.</p>
<p>To bring <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering design into the home, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_aided_design_entry.html">CAD</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers currently use is a valuable guide for what not to do. 
              These packages generally betray their <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> legacy with opaque 
              user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s and awkward installation procedures, and isolate 
              the design of mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s, electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s into modules that are barely on speaking terms.</p>
<p>A design environment to be used in the home should be so simple 
              that even a child could understand it. Because then there's some 
              hope that their parents might be able to also. There's already a 
              pretty good precedent that's routinely used by children without 
              any formal training: Lego. It provides simple standard parts that 
              can be used to assemble complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>That was the original inspiration for the Any Thing project, which 
              in retrospect was the right idea for the wrong medium. It was a 
              mistake to assume that the physical fabrication process had to mirror 
              the logical design process. By moving the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> from a bin of parts 
              to a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> version that exists only inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, 
              the intuitive attraction of building with reusable <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s can 
              be retained without needing to worry about ever running out of anything. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers use "<a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>-oriented <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming" to write 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> this way; with a PEMS <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s can become tangible.</p>
<p>It's <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant that the reusability be extended to the physical 
              as well as the virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. The arrival of fast high-resolution 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>s has created the paperfull office of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> because 
              printing is now so convenient. This is a cautionary tale for PEMS, 
              which threatens to do the same for physical things. Two-dimensional 
              sheets of paper get thrown away in three-dimensional recycling bins; 
              three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s would need a four-dimensional recycling 
              bin.</p>
<p>A slightly more practical alternative is to let the PEMS <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              separate discarded <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s back into raw materials. This is what 
              a state-of-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> waste facility does on a large scale; it's a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> easier on the desktop because the task is restricted to a much 
              smaller group of materials that can be selected in advance to simplify 
              their separation. Just as coins get sorted by weight, differences 
              in the materials' density, melting temperature, electrical conductivity, 
              and so forth can be used to separate them back into the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>'s 
              input bins.</p>
<p>Complementing a PEMS <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> with intuitive design tools and the 
              means to recycle parts provides all of the ingredients needed to 
              personalize fabrication. This just might eliminate some of the many 
              bad ideas that should never have been turned into products. I have 
              a theory for why so many companies full of smart people persist 
              in doing so many dumb things. Each person has some external <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> 
              for communicating with other people, and some internal processing 
              power for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Since these are finite resources, doing more 
              of one ultimately has to come at the expense of the other. As an 
              organization expands, the volume of people inside the company grows 
              faster than the surface area exposed to the outside world. This 
              means that more and more of people's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> gets tied up in internal 
              message passing, eventually crossing a threshold beyond which no 
              one is able to think, or look around, because they have to answer 
              their e-mail, or write a <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> report, or attend a meeting, or 
              review a proposal. Just like a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> that traps <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> inside, 
              the company traps ideas inside organizational boundaries. Stephen 
              Hawking showed that some <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> can sneak out of a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> by 
              being created right at the boundary with the rest of the world; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> is left to do something similar in big companies.</p>
<p>So many people are needed in a company because making a product 
              increasingly requires a strategy group to decide what to do, electrical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to design <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s that get <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists, 
              mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to package the thing, industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers 
              to figure out how to produce it, marketers to sell it, and finally 
              a legal team to protect everyone else from what they've just done. 
              It's exceedingly difficult for one person's vision to carry through 
              all that. Focus groups help companies figure out when they've done 
              something dumb, but they can't substitute for a personal vision 
              since people can't ask for things they can't conceive of.</p>
<p>Companies are trying to flatten their organizational hierarchies 
              and move more decision making out from the center by deploying personal 
              computing to help connect and enable employees. But the impact of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> will always be bounded if the means of production 
              are still locked away like the <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s used to be. For companies 
              looking to foster innovation, for people looking to create rather 
              than just consume the things around them, it's not enough to stop 
              with a Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a> and an on-line catalog. Fabrication as well as 
              computing must come to the desktop.</p>
<p>The parallels between the promise and the problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools are too great to ignore. The personal fabricator 
              now looks to be as inevitable as the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> was a few 
              decades ago. Adding an extra dimension to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s output, from 
              2'D to 3'D, will open up a new dimension in how we live.</p>
<p>This revolutionary idea is really just the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> 
              of the initial impetus behind multimedia. Multimedia has come to 
              mean adding audio and video to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s output, but that's an 
              awfully narrow notion of what constitutes "<a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>." The images and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> don't have to be confined to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen; they can 
              come out here where we are.</p>
