<div class="TeaserText">Steven Spielberg's film "A.I." was previewed at MIT on April 20, 2001 at an event that seemed geared more toward humans than futuristic robots.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published May 7, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>In the beginning of <a class="thought" href="entries/spielberg_entry.html">Steven Spielberg</a>'s "A.I.," William Hurt's scientist/creator-of-A.I. character pokes a needle through the hand of one of his creations (a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, by visual accounts), who emits a shriek. He then tells her to undress, to which she complies without question. </p>
<p>This was intended to illustrate that we haven't come very far in creating robots. In a superficial physical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, they're <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>s to humans, but lacking in <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al depth, with no "ego" to question with. </p>
<p>But then the scientist proposes the next step: to create an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al depth--specifically, the ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>. Questioned on the moral implications, he replies: "Didn't <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> create Adam...to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> Him?"</p>
<p>In a videotaped interview, supporting actor Jude Law, elaborated: "If they are going to outlive us, they better <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>." </p>
<p>Indeed, <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>, was a major theme of the A.I. <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> at MIT on April 30, 2001, which featured a ten minute preview of the film, videotaped interviews with <a class="thought" href="entries/spielberg_entry.html">Steven Spielberg</a> and others, and a Q&amp;A session with Kathleen Kennedy, the executive producer of the film, and its <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>, Haley Joel Osment. There was also a panel discussion with four leading experts in the field--<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/turkle_entry.html">Sherry Turkle</a>  and Cynthia Breazeal--who also made presentations about their work and  insights on the film and the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> .</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> focused on A.I. in the contemporary world and how humans interact with technologies that perform intelligent tasks. As the film promotion says of Haley Joel Osment's character David, "His <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> is real, but he is not." The four experts illustrated how artificially intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, many of which we take for granted, are already real to us, interwoven into the fabric of our lives--in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, travel, and in any situation where we have come to rely on the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>  storing of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>  that humans previously stored in their heads.</p>
<p>It's important to distinguish between two forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> here:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a class="thought" href="entries/weak_ai_entry.html">Weak AI</a>" is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> in the contemporary sense: automated airline ticketing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, medical diagnostic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and even the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that diagnoses problems in your car are forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, albeit focused on specific tasks. </li>
<li>"<a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">Strong AI</a>" refers to artificially intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that act autonomously and reflect understanding, <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>ualization, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-enough qualities to pass the classic Turing (conversational) test. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;The film depicts the latter. <a class="thought" href="entries/turkle_entry.html">Sherry Turkle</a>, Professor of Sociology and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> at MIT, pointed out that we are already assign <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al qualities to these <a class="thought" href="entries/weak_ai_entry.html">weak AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, even though they're not conscious. That is, we anthropomorphize these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> --we believe in an <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al motivation.</p>
<p>Turkle, who has been <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ing children's responses to non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>  "relational objects," explored how we will likely create a new existence for artificially intelligent beings: the idea that they are alive in a different <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. In our relationships, whether with simple toys or complex <a class="thought" href="entries/chatterbot_entry.html">chatterbot</a>s (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>), we adapt so we can have more complex and fulfilling relationships with these objects. </p>
<p>As she puts it, the question of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> becomes bypassed when the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> fulfills its task. We then develop an <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al relationship and assign <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al qualities to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. We know it's not purposeful, but we want to believe it--to understand how the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> feels.</p>
<p>That's the goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> by MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> Lab post doctoral fellow Dr. Cynthia Breazeal: the creation of an <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>, or at least a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al range of an infant. Her <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">KISMET</a> does not attempt to pass <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>s with semantic sophistication, nor does it play chess; instead, it reacts to a wide variety of stimuli in ways modeled after <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> developmental <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> to create a different kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> with humans. </p>
<p>Despite her reminder that there is a great deal more to be done to improve <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">KISMET</a>'s sophistication, one is impressed by how "real" the interactions <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">KISMET</a> has with humans are, as she illustrated in video presentations of these interactions. When <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">KISMET</a> would drop its oversize eyes and frown, not only the videotaped <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> but the audience as well cooed in response to this display of seeming <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>; it is as if <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">KISMET</a> were pushing our genetically coded buttons that we share in response to body <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>.</p>
<p>She also pointed out that it is not hubris that pushes her and others forward in their pursuit of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. The goal is greater understanding of the simple <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> concepts of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> by attempting to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er them. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s we make become our mirrors, she says, similar to how the children of <a class="thought" href="entries/turkle_entry.html">Sherry Turkle</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> project <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s and qualities onto their <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a>, Director of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Lab at MIT, explored how we are becoming <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s ourselves, or at least merging with them. <a class="thought" href="entries/prosthetics_entry.html">Prosthetics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> eye surgery illustrate how we are already moving toward this merger, he said. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> may reveal ways in which we can gain full control over <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er our own bodies as we wish. So the relationships between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s becomes as indistinct as the boundaries between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. It is not a question, as he put it, of "us and them," but more a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of "us as them."</p>
<p>Case in point: Kathleen Kennedy said a 35 foot mechanical tyrannosaurus rex accidentally came alive and wreaked havoc during a lunch break on the <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of "Jurassic Park." Crew members reacted as though it were real (fleeing in terror). This serves as a dual metaphor: does the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> have to be truly artificially intelligent for it to evoke real <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s from its creators and does the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> carry threats for us? </p>
<p>We most likely will not, as <a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a> pointed out, create 747s by accident in our backyards (an example he used for the feared appearance of dangerous technologies that will emerge as if by accident), nor will we create 35 foot man-eating monsters. But we have created plenty of nuclear weapons. What is our responsibility, then, not only in creating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> us, but <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that could destroy us?</p>
<p>No stranger to this debate, inventor/<a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>/author <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a> spoke to these concerns, pointing out the need for more, not less, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> into areas of emerging technologies in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to lay the ethical and legal foundations, as well as develop safeguards before these technologies can be used for destructive means. He also illustrated that more complex forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> on the horizon will demand recognition, socially and politically. And their arrival is imminent, based on past and current <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> trends across a variety of technologies and scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>This was not a showcase of <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic gadgetry, nor does the film seem to be concerned with technological extravagance in its portrayal of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. The concern was psychological, social, and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al--and most importantly, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> responsibility in a world where the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of interaction between humans and their created counterparts is already very complex, and will swiftly become more so.</p>
