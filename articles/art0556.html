<p><i>Testimony presented April 9, 2003 at the Committee on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>, 
              U.S. House of Representatives Hearing to examine the societal implications 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and consider H.R. 766, The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> 
              and Development Act of 2003.</i></p>
<h1>Summary of Testimony: </h1>
<p>The size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is itself inexorably shrinking.&#160; According 
              to my models, both <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and mechanical technologies are shrinking 
              at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per decade.&#160; At this rate, 
              most of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>" by the 2020s. </p>
<p>We are immeasurably better off as a result of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but there 
              is still a lot of suffering in the world to overcome.&#160; We have a 
              moral imperative, therefore, to continue the pursuit of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              and advanced technologies, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, that can continue 
              to overcome <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> affliction.&#160; There is also an economic imperative 
              to continue due to the pervasive acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, including 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, in the competitive economy.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> is not a separate field of study that we can simply 
              relinquish.&#160; We will have no choice but to confront the challenge 
              of guiding <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in a constructive direction.&#160; There are 
              strategies we can deploy, but there will need to be continual development 
              of defensive strategies.&#160; </p>
<p>We can take some level of comfort from our relative success in 
              dealing with one new form of fully non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>: the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>The most immediate danger is not self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              but rather self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; We need to place a much 
              higher priority on developing vitally needed defensive technologies 
              such as antiviral medications.&#160; Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that a bioterrorist 
              does not need to put his "innovations" through the FDA.&#160; </p>
<p>Any broad attempt to relinquish <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will only push it 
              underground, which would interfere with the benefits while actually 
              making the dangers worse.</p>
<p>Existing regulations on the safety of foods, drugs, and other materials 
              in the environment are sufficient to deal with the near-term applications 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, such as nanoparticles. </p>
<h1><a name="_Toc37497149"></a>Full Verbal Testimony:</h1>
<p>Chairman Boehlert, distinguished members of the U.S. House of Representatives 
              Committee on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>, and other distinguished guests, I appreciate 
              this opportunity to respond to your questions and concerns on the 
              vital issue of the societal implications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160; Our 
              rapidly growing ability to manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> at ever 
              smaller scales promises to transform virtually every sector of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, 
              including health and <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, manufacturing, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, travel, and defense.&#160; There will be increasing overlap between 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and other technologies of increasing influence, such 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>.&#160; As with any other 
              technological transformation, we will be faced with deeply intertwined 
              promise and peril.</p>
<p>In my brief verbal remarks, I only have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to summarize my conclusions 
              on this complex subject, and I am providing the Committee with an 
              expanded written response that attempts to explain the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing 
              behind my views.&#160; </p>
<p>Eric Drexler's 1986 thesis developed the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of building <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>-scale 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s using molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s that would precisely guide chemical 
              reactions.&#160; Without going through the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the controversy 
              surrounding feasibility, it is fair to say that the consensus today 
              is that nano-assembly is indeed feasible, although the most dramatic 
              capabilities are still a couple of decades away.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> today has been expanded to include 
              essentially any <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> where the key features are measured in 
              a modest <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of nanometers (under 100 by some definitions).&#160; 
              By this standard, contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s has already passed this 
              threshold.&#160; </p>
<p>For the past two decades, I have studied <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends, along 
              with a team of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers who have assisted me in gathering critical 
              measures of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in different areas, and I have been developing 
              mathematical models of how <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> evolves.&#160; Several conclusions 
              from this study have a direct bearing on the issues before this 
              hearing.&#160; Technologies, particularly those related to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              develop at an exponential pace, generally doubling in capability 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> every year.&#160; This observation includes the 
              power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> &#8211; both <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> 
              sequencing, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, and the size 
              and scope of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in general.&#160; Of particular relevance 
              to this hearing, the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is itself inexorably shrinking.&#160; 
              According to my models, both <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and mechanical technologies 
              are shrinking at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per decade.&#160; 
              At this rate, most of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>" by the 
              2020s.&#160; </p>
<p>The golden age of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is, therefore, a couple of decades 
              away.&#160; This era will bring us the ability to essentially convert 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, directly into physical products.&#160; We 
              will be able to produce virtually any product for pennies per pound.&#160; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s will have greater <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and we will be completing the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to reveal the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> design of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.&#160; 
              We are already placing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in our bodies 
              for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.&#160; With the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              we will be able to keep our bodies and brains in a healthy, optimal 
              state indefinitely.&#160; We will have technologies to reverse environmental 
              pollution.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> and related advanced technologies of 
              the 2020s will bring us the opportunity to overcome age-old problems, 
              including pollution, <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, and aging.&#160; </p>
<p>We hear increasingly strident voices that <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> to the intermingling 
              of the so-called natural world with the products of our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; 
              The increasing intimacy of our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> lives with our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is 
              not a new story, and I would remind the committee that had it not 
              been for the technological advances of the past two centuries, most 
              of us here today would not be here today. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy 
              was 37 years in 1800.&#160; Most humans at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> lived lives dominated 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, intense labor, <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, and misfortune.&#160; We are immeasurably 
              better off as a result of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but there is still a lot of 
              suffering in the world to overcome.&#160; We have a moral imperative, 
              therefore, to continue the pursuit of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and of advanced 
              technologies that can continue to overcome <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> affliction.</p>
<p>There is also an economic imperative to continue.&#160;&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> 
              is not a single field of study that we can simply relinquish, as 
              suggested by <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s essay, "Why the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Doesn't Need Us."&#160; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> is advancing on hundreds of fronts, and is an extremely 
              diverse activity.&#160; We cannot relinquish its pursuit without essentially 
              relinquishing all of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which would require a Brave New 
              World totalitarian scenario, which is inconsistent with the values 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.&#160; </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> has always been a double-edged sword, and that is certainly 
              true of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160; The same <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that promises to advance 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> health and <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> also has the potential for destructive applications.&#160; 
              We can see that <a class="thought" href="entries/duality_entry.html">duality</a> today in <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; The same techniques 
              that could save millions of lives from <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> may also 
              empower a bioterrorist to create a bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>A lot of attention has been paid to the problem of self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> entities that could essentially form a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> that would threaten the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.&#160;I discuss in my written testimony 
              steps we can take now and in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to ameliorate these dangers.&#160;However, 
              the primary point I would like to make is that we will have no choice 
              but to confront the challenge of guiding <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in a constructive 
              direction.&#160; Any broad attempt to relinquish <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will 
              only push it underground, which would interfere with the benefits 
              while actually making the dangers worse.&#160;</p>
<p>As a test case, we can take a small measure of comfort from how 
              we have dealt with one recent technological challenge.&#160;There exists 
              today a new form of fully <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> 
              that didn't exist just a few decades ago: the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>.&#160; When 
              this form of destructive intruder first appeared, strong concerns 
              were voiced that as they became more sophisticated, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s 
              had the potential to destroy the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> medium they live 
              in.&#160;Yet the "<a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>" that has evolved in response to this 
              challenge has been largely effective.&#160;Although destructive self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> entities do cause damage from <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the injury 
              is but a small fraction of the benefit we receive from the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> links that harbor them.&#160;No one would suggest we 
              do away with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>s, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> because 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses.&#160;</p>
<p>One might counter that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses do not have the lethal 
              potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> viruses or of destructive <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160;This 
              is not always the case: we rely on <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to monitor patients 
              in critical care units, to fly and land airplanes, to guide intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s in our current campaign in Iraq, and other "mission critical" 
              tasks.&#160;To the extent that this is true, however, this observation 
              only strengthens my argument.&#160; The fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses are 
              not usually deadly to humans only means that more people are willing 
              to create and release them.&#160; It also means that our response to 
              the danger is that much less intense.&#160; Conversely, when it comes 
              to self-replicating entities that are potentially lethal on a large 
              scale, our response on all levels will be vastly more serious, as 
              we have seen since 9-11.&#160; </p>
<p>I would describe our response to <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s as effective 
              and successful.&#160; Although they remain (and always will remain) a 
              concern, the danger remains at a nuisance level.&#160; Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that 
              this success is in an industry in which there is no regulation, 
              and no certification for practitioners.&#160; This largely unregulated 
              industry is also enormously productive.&#160; One could argue that it 
              has contributed more to our technological and economic <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              than any other enterprise in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>Some of the concerns that have been raised, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s 
              article, are effective because they paint a picture of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> dangers 
              as if they were released on today's unprepared world.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> 
              is that the sophistication and power of our defensive technologies 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> will grow along with the dangers.&#160; </p>
<p>The challenge most immediately in front of us is not self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, but rather self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; The 
              next two decades will be the golden age of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, whereas 
              the comparable era for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will follow in the 2020s and 
              beyond.&#160; We are now in the early stages of a transforming <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              based on the intersection of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.&#160; We 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> the "<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>" <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> processes.&#160; 
              By reprogramming the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes that lead to and encourage 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and aging, we will have the ability to overcome these afflictions.&#160; 
              However, the same <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> can also empower a terrorist to create 
              a bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>As we compare the success we have had in controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses to the coming challenge of controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> viruses, we are struck with one <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> difference.&#160; 
              As I noted, the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> industry is almost completely unregulated.&#160; 
              The same is obviously not the case for <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; <u>A bioterrorist 
              does not need to put his "innovations" through the FDA</u>.&#160; However, 
              we do require the scientists developing the defensive technologies 
              to follow the existing regulations, which slow down the innovation 
              process at every step.&#160; Moreover, it is impossible, under existing 
              regulations and ethical standards, to test defenses to bioterrorist 
              agents on humans.&#160; There is already extensive discussion to modify 
              these regulations to allow for <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> models and simulations to 
              replace infeasible <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> trials.&#160; This will be necessary, but I 
              believe we will need to go beyond these steps to accelerate the 
              development of vitally needed defensive technologies.&#160; </p>
<p>With the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human genome project</a>, 3 to 5 percent of the budgets were 
              devoted to the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; A similar commitment for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> would be 
              appropriate and constructive.&#160; </p>
<p>Near-term applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> are far more limited in 
              their benefits as well as more benign in their potential dangers.&#160; 
              These include developments in the materials area involving the addition 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s with multi-nanometer features to plastics, textiles, 
              and other products.&#160; These have perhaps the greatest potential in 
              the area of <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> development by allowing new strategies 
              for highly targeted drugs that perform their intended function and 
              reach the appropriate tissues, while minimizing side effects.&#160; This 
              development is not qualitatively different than what we have been 
              doing for decades in that many new materials involve constituent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s that are <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> and of a similar physical scale.&#160; The emerging 
              nanoparticle <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> provides more precise control, but the idea 
              of introducing new <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> materials into the environment 
              is hardly a new <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>.&#160; We cannot say a priori that all nanoengineered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s are safe, nor would it be appropriate to deem them necessarily 
              unsafe.&#160; Environmental tests thus far have not shown <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for 
              undue concern, and it is my view that existing regulations on the 
              safety of foods, drugs, and other materials in the environment are 
              sufficient to deal with these near-term applications.&#160; </p>
<p>The voices that are expressing concern about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> are 
              the same voices that have expressed undue levels of concern about 
              genetically modified <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s.&#160; As with nanoparticles, GMO's are 
              neither inherently safe nor unsafe, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able levels of regulation 
              for safety are appropriate.&#160; However, none of the dire warnings 
              about GMO's have come to pass.&#160; Already, African nations, such as 
              Zambia and Zimbabwe, have rejected vitally needed food aid under 
              pressure from European anti-GMO activists.&#160; The reflexive anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              stance that has been reflected in the GMO controversy will not be 
              helpful in balancing the benefits and risks of nanoparticle <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>In summary, I believe that existing regulatory mechanisms are sufficient 
              to handle near-term applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160; As for the 
              long term, we need to appreciate that a myriad of nanoscale technologies 
              are inevitable.&#160; The current examinations and dialogues on achieving 
              the promise while ameliorating the peril are appropriate and will 
              deserve sharply increased attention as we get closer to realizing 
              these revolutionary technologies.&#160; </p>

              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Trends</h2>
<p>A diverse <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> such as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>es on many 
              fronts and is comprised of hundreds of small steps forward, each 
              benign in itself.&#160; An examination of these trends shows that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              in which the key features are measured in a small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of nanometers 
              is inevitable.&#160; I hereby provide some examples of my study of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              trends.&#160; </p>
<p>The motivation for this study came from my interest in inventing.&#160; 
              As an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> in the 1970s, I came to realize that my <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s 
              needed to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in terms of the enabling technologies and market 
              forces that would exist when the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> was introduced, which 
              would represent a very different world than when it was conceived.&#160; 
              I began to develop models of how distinct technologies &#8211; <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> processors, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, magnetic storage, and 
              the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> &#8211; developed and how these changes rippled 
              through markets and ultimately our social institutions.&#160;&#160; I realized 
              that most <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s fail not because they never work, but because 
              their timing is wrong.&#160; Inventing is a lot like surfing, you have 
              to anticipate and catch the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> at just the right moment.&#160; </p>
<p>In the 1980s, my interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends and implications 
              took on a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of its own, and I began to use my models of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              trends to project and anticipate the technologies of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> times, 
              such as the year 2000, 2010, 2020, and beyond.&#160; This enabled me 
              to invent with the capabilities of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.&#160; In the late 1980s, 
              I wrote my first book, <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a></i>, which 
              ended with the specter of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> becoming indistinguishable 
              from its <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> progenitors.&#160; This book included hundreds of predictions 
              about the 1990s and early 2000 years, and my track record of prediction 
              has held up well.&#160; </p>
<p>During the 1990s I gathered empirical <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on the apparent acceleration 
              of all <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-related technologies and sought to refine the 
              mathematical models underlying these observations.&#160; In <i>The Age 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</i> (ASM), which I wrote in 1998, I introduced 
              refined models of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and a theory I called "the law of 
              accelerating returns," which explained why <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> evolves in 
              an exponential fashion.&#160; </p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/intuitive_linear_view_entry.html">Intuitive Linear View</a> versus the <a class="thought" href="entries/historical_exponential_view_entry.html">Historical Exponential View</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is widely misunderstood.&#160; Our forebears expected the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to be pretty much like their present, which had been pretty 
              much like their past.&#160; Although <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s did exist a thousand 
              years ago, they were at that very early stage where an exponential 
              trend is so flat and so slow that it looks like no trend at all.&#160; 
              So their lack of expectations was largely fulfilled.&#160; Today, in 
              accordance with the common <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, everyone expects continuous technological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and the social repercussions that follow.&#160; But the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              will nonetheless be far more surprising than most observers realize 
              because few have truly internalized the implications of the fact 
              that the rate of change itself is accelerating.&#160; </p>
<p>Most long-range forecasts of technical feasibility in <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              periods dramatically underestimate the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments 
              because they are based on what I call the "intuitive <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>" view 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> rather than the "<a class="thought" href="entries/historical_exponential_view_entry.html">historical exponential view</a>."&#160; To express 
              this another way, it is not the case that we will <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> a hundred 
              years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the twenty-first century; rather we will witness 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of twenty thousand years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> (at <i>today's</i> 
              rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, that is). </p>
<p>When people think of a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> period, they intuitively assume that 
              the current rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> will continue for <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> periods.&#160; 
              Even for those who have been around long enough to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> how 
              the pace increases over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, an unexamined <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> nonetheless 
              provides the impression that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> changes at the rate that we 
              have <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d recently.&#160; From the mathematician's perspective, 
              a primary <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this is that an exponential curve approximates 
              a straight line when viewed for a brief duration.&#160; It is typical, 
              therefore, that even sophisticated commentators, when considering 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, extrapolate the current pace of change over the next 
              10 years or 100 years to determine their expectations.&#160; This is 
              why I call this way of looking at the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> the "intuitive <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>" 
              view.&#160; </p>
<p>But a serious assessment of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> shows that 
              technological change is exponential.&#160; In <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, we 
              find that a key measurement such as <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power is multiplied 
              by a constant factor for each unit of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (e.g., doubling every 
              year) rather than just being added to incrementally.&#160; Exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> is a feature of any <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process, of which <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              is a primary example.&#160; One can examine the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in different ways, 
              on different <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scales, and for a wide variety of technologies 
              ranging from <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, as well as social implications 
              ranging from the size of the economy to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span, and the 
              acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> applies.&#160; Indeed, we find not 
              just simple <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, but "double" <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, 
              meaning that the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is itself growing exponentially.&#160; 
              These observations do not rely merely on an assumption of the continuation 
              of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a> (i.e., the exponential shrinking of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> sizes 
              on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>), but is based on a rich model of diverse 
              technological processes.&#160; What it clearly shows is that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              particularly the pace of technological change, advances (at least) 
              exponentially, not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly, and has been doing so since the advent 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, indeed since the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Many scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have what my colleague Lucas Hendrich 
              calls "<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er's pessimism."&#160; Often an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er or scientist who 
              is so immersed in the difficulties and intricate details of a contemporary 
              challenge fails to appreciate the ultimate long-term implications 
              of their own work, and, in particular, the larger field of work 
              that they operate in.&#160; Consider the biochemists in 1985 who were 
              skeptical of the announcement of the goal of transcribing the entire 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> in a mere 15 years.&#160; These scientists had just spent an entire 
              year transcribing a mere one ten-thousandth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, so even 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able anticipated advances, it seemed to them like it 
              would be hundreds of years, if not longer, before the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              could be sequenced.&#160; Or consider the skepticism expressed in the 
              mid 1980s that the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> would ever be a significant <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>, 
              given that it included only tens of thousands of nodes.&#160; The fact 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of nodes was doubling every year and there were, 
              therefore, likely to be tens of millions of nodes ten years later 
              was not appreciated by those who struggled with "state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in 1985, which permitted adding only a few thousand nodes 
              throughout the world in a year. </p>
<p>I emphasize this point because it is the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant failure 
              that would-be prognosticators make in considering <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> trends.&#160; 
              The vast majority of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forecasts and forecasters ignore 
              altogether this "<a class="thought" href="entries/historical_exponential_view_entry.html">historical exponential view</a>" of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.&#160; 
              Indeed, almost everyone I meet has a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> view of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.&#160; 
              That is why people tend to overestimate what can be achieved in 
              the short term (because we tend to leave out necessary details), 
              but underestimate what can be achieved in the long term (because 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is ignored).&#160; </p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a></h2>
<p>The ongoing acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is the implication and inevitable 
              result of what I call the "<a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>," which describes 
              the acceleration of the pace and the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of the products 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. This includes <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, particularly 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-bearing technologies, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.&#160; More specifically, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> states the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> applies positive feedback in that the more capable 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s resulting from one stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> are 
                  used to create the next stage.&#160; As a result, the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
                  of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process increases exponentially over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; 
                  Over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the "<a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>" of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> embedded in the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
                  process (i.e., the measure of how well the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> fits 
                  a purpose, which in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is survival) increases.&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; A correlate of the above observation is that the "returns" 
                  of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process (e.g., the speed, cost-effectiveness, 
                  or overall "power" of a process) increase exponentially over 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; In another positive feedback loop, as a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
                  process (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>) becomes more effective (e.g., cost 
                  effective), greater resources are deployed towards the further 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of that process.&#160; This results in a second level of 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> (i.e., the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> itself 
                  grows exponentially).&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is one such <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; Technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is another such <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process.&#160; 
                  Indeed, the emergence of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> 
                  resulted in the new <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; Therefore, 
                  technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is an outgrowth of &#8211; and a continuation 
                  of&#160; &#8211;&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.&#160;&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; A specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> (a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> or approach to solving a problem, 
                  e.g., shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> as an approach 
                  to making more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s) provides <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
                  until the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> exhausts its potential.&#160; When this happens, 
                  a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> (a fundamental change in the approach) occurs, 
                  which enables <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> to continue. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; Each <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> follows an "S-curve," which consists of slow 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> (the early phase of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>), followed by 
                  rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> (the late, explosive phase of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>), 
                  followed by a leveling off as the particular <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> matures.&#160; 
                </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; During this third or maturing phase in the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle of 
                  a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, pressure builds for the next <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>.&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; When the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> occurs, the process begins a new 
                  S-curve.&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; Thus the acceleration of the overall <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process 
                  proceeds as a sequence of S-curves, and the overall exponential 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> consists of this cascade of S-curves.&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; The resources underlying the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
                  process are relatively unbounded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; One resource is the (ever-growing) <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
                  process itself.&#160; Each stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> provides more powerful 
                  tools for the next.&#160; In <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, the advent of 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> allowed more powerful and faster <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary "<a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s."&#160; 
                  Later, setting the "designs" of <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> body plans during the 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion allowed rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary development of 
                  other body organs, such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#160; Or to take a more recent 
                  example, the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-assisted design tools allows 
                  rapid development of the next generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#160; The other required resource is the "<a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>" of the environment 
                  in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process takes place and which provides 
                  the options for further <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>.&#160; In <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> enters the process in the form of mutations and ever- 
                  changing environmental conditions, including cosmological disasters 
                  (e.g., asteroids hitting the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>).&#160; In technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ingenuity combined with ever-changing market conditions 
                  keep the process of innovation going.&#160; </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we apply these principles at the highest level of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, the first step, the creation of cells, introduced the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>.&#160; The subsequent emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> provided a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> to record the results of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s.&#160; 
              Then, the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that combined rational <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              with an opposable appendage (the thumb) caused a fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              shift from <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; The upcoming primary <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              shift will be from <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> to a hybrid combining <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.&#160; This hybrid will include "<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly

              brains. </p>
<p>If we examine the timing of these steps, we see that the process 
              has continuously accelerated.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms required 
              billions of years for the first steps (e.g., primitive cells); later 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> accelerated.&#160; During the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion, major <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              shifts took only tens of millions of years.&#160; Later on, <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">Humanoid</a>s 
              developed over a period of millions of years, and <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> over 
              a period of only hundreds of thousands of years.&#160; </p>
<p>With the advent of a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, the exponential 
              pace became too fast for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-guided <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> 
              and moved on to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-created <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> goes beyond 
              mere tool making; it is a process of creating ever more powerful 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> using the tools from the previous round of innovation, 
              and is, thereby, an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process.&#160; The first technological 
              steps&#160; -- sharp edges, fire, the wheel &#8211; took tens of thousands 
              of years.&#160; For people living in this era, there was little noticeable 
              technological change in even a thousand years.&#160; By 1000 AD, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>

              two.&#160; In the nineteenth century, we saw more technological change 
              than in the nine centuries preceding it.&#160; Then in the first twenty 
              years of the twentieth century, we saw more advancement than in 
              all of the nineteenth century.&#160; Now, <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s occur in only 
              a few years <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> did not exist in anything

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rate (i.e., the overall rate of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>) 
              is currently doubling (approximately) every decade; that is, <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              shift times are halving every decade (and the rate of acceleration 
              is itself growing exponentially).&#160; So, the technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in the twenty-first century will be equivalent to what would require 
              (in the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> view) on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 200 centuries.&#160; In contrast, 
              the twentieth century saw only about 20 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> (again 
              at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>) since we have been speeding up to current 
              rates.&#160; So the twenty-first century will see about a thousand times 
              greater technological change than its predecessor.&#160; </p>
<h1><a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> and Beyond</h1>
<p>There is a wide range of technologies that are subject to the law 
              of accelerating returns.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a> that has gained 
              the greatest public recognition has become known as "<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>." 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, one of the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, and then 
              Chairman of Intel, noted in the mid-1970s that we could squeeze 
              twice as many <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> every 24 months.&#160; 
              Given that the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s have less distance to travel, the <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s 
              also run twice as fast, providing an overall quadrupling of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              power. </p>
<p>However, the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing is much broader than 
              <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>If we plot the speed (in instructions per second) per $1000 (in 
              constant dollars) of 49 famous <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s spanning 
              the entire twentieth century, we note that there were four completely 
              different <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s that provided <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> 
              of computing before the <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s were invented.&#160; Therefore, 
              <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> was not the first, but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to exponentially 
              grow the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.&#160; And it won't be the last.&#160; When 
              <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> reaches the end of its S-Curve, now expected before 
              2020, the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> will continue with three-dimensional 
              molecular computing, a prime example of the application of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              which will constitute the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>When I suggested in my book <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i>, 
              published in 1999, that three-dimensional molecular computing, particularly 
              an approach based on using <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, would become the dominant 
              computing <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in the teen years of this century, 
              that was considered a radical notion.&#160; There has been so much <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in the past four years, with literally dozens of major milestones 
              having been achieved, that this expectation is now a mainstream 
              view.&#160; </p>

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing is a marvelous quantitative 
              example of the exponentially growing returns from an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process.&#160; We can express the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing in 
              terms of an accelerating pace: it took 90 years to achieve the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> (million instructions per second) per thousand dollars; now 
              we add one <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> per thousand dollars every day.&#160; </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> narrowly refers to the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an

              even more narrowly in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> feature size.&#160; But rather 
              than feature size (which is only one contributing factor), or even 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, I think the most appropriate measure to track 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al speed per unit cost.&#160; This takes into account many 
              levels of "cleverness" (i.e., innovation, which is to 
              say, technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>).&#160; In addition to all of the innovation 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, there are multiple layers of innovation 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> design, e.g., pipelining, <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a>, instruction

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> uses a very inefficient electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-controlled

              done in the interneuronal connections at a speed of only about 200 
              calculations per second (in each connection), which is about ten 
              million times slower than contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s.&#160; But

              organization <i>in three dimensions</i>.&#160; There are many technologies

              inch of nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry would be a million times more powerful 
              than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#160; There are more than enough new computing

<p>As I discussed above, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to distinguish between the

              that is characteristic of any specific technological <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> and 
              the continuing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> that is characteristic of the 
              ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; Specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s, 
              such as <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, do ultimately reach levels at which exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> is no longer feasible.&#160; That is why <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> is an S curve.&#160; 
              But the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is an ongoing exponential (at least

              also called innovation, turns the S curve of any specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              into a continuing exponential. A new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> (e.g., three-dimensional

<p>The following two charts show the overall <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 
              based on the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of hosts (<a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s).&#160; These two charts 
              plot the same <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, but one is on an exponential axis and the other 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>.&#160; As I pointed out earlier, whereas <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>es

              So from the perspective of most observers, nothing was happening 
              until the mid 1990s when seemingly out of nowhere, the World Wide 
              Web and <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a> exploded into view.&#160; But the emergence of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 
              into a worldwide <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> was readily predictable much earlier

<p class="caption">Notice how the explosion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> appears 
              to be a surprise from the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">Linear</a> Chart, but was perfectly predictable

<p>The most relevant trend to this hearing, and one that will have 
              profound implications for the twenty-first century is the pervasive 
              trend towards making things smaller, i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>.&#160; The

<p>Ubiquitous <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is two to three decades away.&#160; A prime 
              example of its application will be to deploy billions of "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s": 
              small robots the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> blood cells that can travel inside 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bloodstream.&#160; This notion is not as <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic as it may 
              sound in that there have already been successful <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              using this <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> . There are already four major conferences on 
              "BioMEMS" (<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> Micro <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s) covering 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> blood stream.&#160; </p>
<p>Consider several examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which, based on 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> and cost <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> trends, will be feasible within 
              30 years.&#160; In addition to scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to facilitate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will be able to 
              perform a broad variety of diagnostic and therapeutic functions 
              inside the bloodstream and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a>, for example, 
              has designed robotic replacements for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> blood cells that perform 
              hundreds or thousands of times more effectively than their <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              counterparts.&#160; With Freitas' "respirocytes," (robotic red blood 
              cells), you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking 
              a breath.&#160; His robotic macrophages will be far more effective than 
              our white blood cells at combating <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s.&#160; His <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> 
              would be able to repair <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> transcription errors, and even <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> 
              needed <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> changes.&#160; Although Freitas' <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual designs are two 
              or three decades away, there has already been substantial <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              on bloodstream-based <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.&#160; For example, one scientist has cured 
              type I Diabetes in rats with a nanoengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that incorporates 
              pancreatic Islet cells.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> has seven- nanometer pores that 
              let insulin out, but block the antibodies which destroy these cells.&#160; 
              There are many innovative projects of this type already under way.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Clearly, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has profound <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> applications, 
              and any expectation that such uses will be "relinquished" are highly 
              unrealistic.&#160; Already, DOD is developing "smart dust," which are 
              tiny robots the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s or even smaller.&#160; Although not quite 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, millions of these <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s can be dropped into enemy 
              territory to provide highly detailed surveillance.&#160; The potential 
              application for even smaller, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s is even 
              greater.&#160; Want to find Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden?&#160; Need 
              to locate hidden <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s of mass destruction?&#160; Billions of&#160; essentially 
              invisible spies could monitor every square inch of enemy territory, 
              identify every person and every <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>, and even carry out missions 
              to destroy enemy targets.&#160; The only way for an enemy to counteract 
              such a force is, of course, with their own <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160; The 
              point is that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s will obsolete <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s 
              of larger size.&#160; </p>
<p>In addition, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will also be able to expand our <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s 
              and our capabilities.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will provide fully immersive, 
              totally convincing <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> in the following way.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s 
              take up positions in close physical proximity to every interneuronal 
              connection coming from all of our senses (e.g., eyes, ears, skin).&#160; 
              We already have the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to communicate 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in both directions that requires no direct physical 
              contact with the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s.&#160; For example, scientists at the <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> 
              Institute have developed "<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s" that can detect the 
              firing of a nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, or alternatively, can cause a nearby 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to fire, or suppress it from firing.&#160; This amounts to two-way 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s.&#160; 
              The Institute scientists demonstrated their <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> by controlling 
              the movement of a living leech from their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.&#160; Again, the 
              primary aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> that is not yet 
              feasible is size and cost.&#160; </p>
<p>When we want to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s just stay 
              in position (in the capillaries) and do nothing.&#160; If we want to 
              enter <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they suppress all of the inputs coming from 
              the real senses, and replace them with the signals that would be 
              appropriate for the virtual environment.&#160; You (i.e., your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>) 
              could decide to cause your muscles and limbs to move as you normally 
              would, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s again intercept these interneuronal signals, 
              suppress your real limbs from moving, and instead cause your virtual 
              limbs to move and provide the appropriate movement and reorientation 
              in the virtual environment.&#160; </p>
<p>The Web will provide a panoply of virtual environments to explore.&#160; 
              Some will be recreations of real places, others will be fanciful 
              environments that have no "real" counterpart.&#160; Some indeed would 
              be impossible in the physical world (perhaps, because they violate 
              the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>).&#160; We will be able to "go" to these virtual 
              environments by ourselves, or we will meet other people there, both 
              real people and simulated people.&#160; Of course, ultimately there won't 
              be a clear distinction between the two.&#160; </p>
<p>By 2030, going to a web site will mean entering a full-immersion 
              virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> environment.&#160; In addition to encompassing all of 
              the senses, these shared environments can include <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al overlays 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will be capable of triggering the neurological correlates 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, sexual pleasure, and other derivatives of our sensory 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> and mental reactions.</p>
<p>In the same way that people today beam their lives from web cams 
              in their bedrooms, "<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> beamers" circa 2030 will beam their 
              entire flow of sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s, and if so desired, their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s 
              and other secondary reactions.&#160; We'll be able to plug in (by going 
              to the appropriate web site) and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> other people's lives 
              as in the plot <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of 'Being John Malkovich.'&#160; Particularly 
              interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s can be archived and relived at any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>We won't need to wait until 2030 to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> shared virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> 
              environments, at least for the visual and auditory senses.&#160; Full-immersion 
              visual-auditory environments will be available by the end of this 
              decade, with images written directly onto our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s by our eyeglasses 
              and contact lenses.&#160; All of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, 
              image reconstruction, and very high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connection 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> will be embedded in our glasses and woven into our 
              clothing, so <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as distinct <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s will disappear.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>In my view, the most significant implication of the development 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and related advanced technologies of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
              century will be the merger of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.&#160; 
              First, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to point out that well before the end of 
              the twenty-first century, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s will 
              dominate.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is stuck at 10<sup>26</sup> calculations 
              per second (for all <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains), and that figure will 
              not appreciably change, even with <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> changes to our

              well before the middle of this century.&#160; However, in my view, this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> should still be considered <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> as it

<p>One of the key ways in which the two worlds can interact will be

              abilities.&#160; Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s are communicating with each other

<p>Using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s as <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> extenders is a significant improvement

              They can all be directed to leave, so the process is easily reversible.&#160; 
              They are <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable, in that they can provide <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>

<h1><a name="_Toc37497157"></a><a name="_Toc37515632"></a>The Economic 
              Imperatives of the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a></h1>
<p>It is the economic imperative of a competitive marketplace that 
              is driving <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forward and fueling the law of accelerating 
              returns.&#160; In turn, the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> is transforming 
              economic relationships.&#160; </p>
<p>The primary force driving <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is economic imperative.&#160; We 
              are moving towards nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, as well as more intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, as the result of a myriad of small advances, each with 
              their own particular economic justification.&#160; </p>
<p>To use one small example of many from my own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> at one 
              of my companies (Kurzweil Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>), whenever we came 
              up with a slightly more intelligent version of speech recognition, 
              the new version invariably had greater value than the earlier generation 
              and, as a result, sales increased.&#160; It is interesting to note that 
              in the example of speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the three primary 
              surviving competitors stayed very close to each other in the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.&#160; A few other companies that failed to do so (e.g., 
              Speech <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s) went out of business.&#160; At any point in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we 
              would be able to sell the version prior to the latest version for 
              perhaps a quarter of the price of the current version.&#160; As for versions 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that were two generations old, we couldn't even 
              give those away.&#160; </p>
<p>There is a vital economic imperative to create smaller and more 
              intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s that can more precisely carry 
              out their missions have enormous value.&#160; That is why they are being 
              built.&#160; There are tens of thousands of projects that are advancing 
              the various aspects of the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> in diverse 
              incremental ways.&#160; Regardless of near-term <a class="thought" href="entries/business_cycle_entry.html">business cycle</a>s, the 
              support for "high tech" in the business community, and in particular 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> advancement, has grown enormously.&#160; When I started 
              my <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a>) and speech <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> company 
              (Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Products, Inc.) in 1974, high-tech venture deals 
              totaled approximately $10 million.&#160; Even during today's high tech 
              recession, the figure is 100 times greater.&#160; We would have to repeal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> and every visage of economic competition to stop this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion.</p>
<p>The economy (viewed either in total or per capita) has been growing 
              exponentially throughout this century:</p>
<p><img height="296" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613224417im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart24.jpg" width="375"></p>
<p>Note that the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in the economy is a 
              far more powerful force than periodic recessions.&#160; Even the "Great 
              Depression" represents only a minor blip compared to the underlying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>.&#160; Most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, recessions, including the 
              depression, represent only temporary deviations from the underlying 
              curve.&#160; In each case, the economy ends up exactly where it would 
              have been had the recession/depression never occurred.&#160; </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">Productivity</a> (economic output per worker) has also been growing 
              exponentially.&#160; Even these statistics are greatly understated because 
              they do not fully reflect significant improvements in the quality 
              and features of products and services.&#160; It is not the case that 
              "a car is a car;" there have been significant improvements in safety, 
              reliability, and features.&#160; Certainly, $1000 of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> today 
              is immeasurably more powerful than $1000 of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> ten years 
              ago (by a factor of more than1000).&#160; There are a myriad of such 
              examples.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">Pharmaceutical</a> drugs are increasingly effective.&#160; Products 
              ordered in five minutes on the web and delivered to your door are 
              worth more than products that you have to fetch yourself.&#160; Clothes 
              custom-manufactured for your unique <a class="thought" href="entries/body_scan_entry.html">body scan</a> are worth more than 
              clothes you happen to find left on a store rack.&#160; These sorts of 
              improvements are true for most product categories, and none of them 
              are reflected in the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> statistics.&#160; </p>
<p>The statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s underlying the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> measurements 
              tend to factor out gains by essentially concluding that we still 
              only get one dollar of products and services for a dollar despite 
              the fact that we get much more for a dollar (e.g., compare a $1,000 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> today to one ten years ago).&#160; University of Chicago Professor 
              Pete Klenow and University of Rochester Professor Mark Bils estimate 
              that the value of existing goods has been increasing at 1.5% per 
              year for the past 20 years because of qualitative improvements.&#160; 
              This still does not account for the introduction of entirely new 
              products and product categories (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones, pagers, pocket 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s).&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/bls_entry.html">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, which is responsible 
              for the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> statistics, uses a model that incorporates an 
              estimate of quality <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> at only 0.5% per year, reflecting a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic 
              underestimate of quality improvement and a resulting overestimate 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> by at least 1 percent per year.&#160; </p>
<p>Despite these weaknesses in the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, 
              the gains in <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> are now reaching the steep part of the 
              exponential curve.&#160; Labor <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> grew at 1.6% per year until 
              1994, then rose at 2.4% per year, and is now growing even more rapidly.&#160; 
              In the quarter ending July 30, 2000, labor <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> grew at 
              5.3%.&#160; Manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> grew at 4.4% annually from 1995

              in the channels of distribution through the Web and other new <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>

<p>All of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trend charts above represent massive deflation.&#160; 
              There are many examples of the impact of these escalating efficiencies.&#160; 
              BP Amoco's cost for finding oil is now less than $1 per barrel, 
              down from nearly $10 in 1991.&#160; Processing an <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> transaction 
              costs a bank one penny, compared to over $1 using a teller ten years 
              ago.&#160; A Roland Berger/Deutsche Bank study estimates a cost savings 
              of $1200 per North American car over the next five years.&#160; A more 
              optimistic Morgan Stanley study estimates that <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>-based procurement

<p>None of this means that cycles of recession will disappear immediately.&#160; 
              Indeed there is a current economic slowdown and a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-sector 
              recession.&#160; The economy still has some of the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> 
              that historically have caused cycles of recession, specifically 
              excessive commitments such as over-investment, excessive capital 
              intensive projects and the overstocking of <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>ies.&#160; However, 
              the rapid dissemination of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, sophisticated forms of online 
              procurement, and increasingly transparent markets in all industries 
              have diminished the impact of this cycle.&#160; So "recessions" are likely 
              to have less direct impact on our standard of living. The underlying 
              long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate will continue at a double exponential rate.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Moreover, innovation and the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> are not noticeably 
              affected by the minor deviations caused by economic cycles.&#160; All 
              of the technologies exhibiting <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> shown in the above 
              charts are continuing without losing a beat through this economic 
              slowdown.&#160; </p>
<p>The overall <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of the economy reflects completely new forms 
              and layers of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and value that did not previously exist, or

<p>Consider unrestrained <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> replication.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>

              is through <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, essentially the same approach used 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> world.&#160; And in the same way that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>

              all physical entities, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> or otherwise. I address below 
              steps we can take to address this grave risk, but we cannot have 
              complete assurance in any strategy that we devise today.&#160; </p>
<p>Other primary concerns include "who is controlling the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s?" 
              and "who are the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s talking to?"&#160; Organizations (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, 
              extremist groups) or just a clever <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> could put trillions 
              of undetectable <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in the water or food supply of an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              or of an entire population.&#160; These "spy" <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s could then monitor, 
              influence, and even control our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s.&#160; In addition 
              to introducing physical spy <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, existing <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s could be 
              influenced through <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses and other <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> "hacking" 
              techniques.&#160; When there is <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> running in our brains, issues 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> and security will take on a new urgency.&#160; </p>
<p>My own expectation is that the creative and constructive applications 
              of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will dominate, as I believe they do today.&#160; However, 
              I believe we need to invest more heavily in developing specific 
              defensive technologies.&#160; As I address further below, we are at this 
              stage today for <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, and will reach the stage where we 
              need to directly <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> defensive technologies for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              during the late teen years of this century.&#160; </p>
<p>If we imagine describing the dangers that exist today to people 
              who lived a couple of hundred years ago, they would think it mad 
              to take such risks.&#160; On the other hand, how many people in the year 
              2000 would really want to go back to the short, brutish, <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>-filled, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>-stricken, disaster-prone lives that 99 percent of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              race struggled through a couple of centuries ago?&#160; We may romanticize 
              the past, but up until fairly recently, most of humanity lived extremely 
              fragile lives where one all-too-common misfortune could spell disaster.&#160;&#160; 
              Substantial portions of our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> still live in this precarious 
              way, which is at least one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to continue technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              and the economic enhancement that accompanies it.&#160; </p>
<p>People often go through three stages in examining the impact of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>: awe and wonderment at its potential to overcome 
              age old problems; then a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of dread at a new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of grave dangers 
              that accompany these new technologies; followed, finally and hopefully, 
              by the realization that the only viable and responsible path is 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> a careful course that can realize the promise while managing 
              the peril.&#160; </p>
<p>This congressional hearing was party inspired by <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s cover 
              story for <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a> magazine, <i>Why The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Doesn't Need </i>Us.&#160; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, cofounder of <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a> and principal developer 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/java_entry.html">Java</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, has recently taken up a personal 
              mission to warn us of the impending dangers from the emergence of 
              self-replicating technologies in the fields of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, which he aggregates under the label "<a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>."&#160; Although 
              his warnings are not entirely new, they have attracted considerable 
              attention because of Joy's credibility as one of our leading technologists.&#160; 
              It is reminiscent of the attention that George Soros, the currency 
              arbitrager and arch capitalist, received when he made vaguely critical 
              comments about the excesses of unrestrained <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> .</p>
<p>Joy's concerns include genetically altered designer <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s, 
              followed by self-replicating entities created through <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. 
              And&#160; if we manage to survive these first two perils, we will encounter 
              robots whose <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will rival and ultimately exceed our own. 
              Such robots may make great assistants, but who's to say that we 
              can count on them to remain reliably friendly to mere humans?</p>
<p>Although I am often cast as the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> optimist who counters 
              Joy's pessimism, I do share his concerns regarding self-replicating 
              technologies; indeed, I played a role in bringing these dangers 
              to Bill's attention. In many of the dialogues and forums in which 
              I have participated on this subject, I end up defending Joy's position 
              with regard to the feasibility of these technologies and scenarios 
              when they come under attack by commentators who I believe are being 
              quite shortsighted in their skepticism. Even so, I do find fault 
              with Joy's prescription: halting the advance of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and the 
              pursuit of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in broad fields such as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>In his essay, <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> eloquently described the plagues of centuries 
              past and how new self-replicating technologies, such as mutant bioengineered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s and "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s" run amok, may bring back long-forgotten 
              pestilence.&#160; Indeed these are real dangers.&#160; It is also the case, 
              which Joy acknowledges, that it has been technological advances, 
              such as <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s and improved sanitation, which have freed us 
              from the prevalence of such plagues.&#160; Suffering in the world continues 
              and demands our steadfast attention.&#160; Should we tell the millions 
              of people afflicted with <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and other devastating conditions 
              that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments 
              because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday 
              be used for malevolent purposes?&#160; Having asked the rhetorical question, 
              I realize that there is a movement to do exactly that, but I think 
              most people would agree that such broad-based <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> is 
              not the answer.&#160; </p>
<p>The continued opportunity to alleviate <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> distress is one <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              motivation for continuing technological advancement.&#160; Also compelling 
              are the already apparent economic gains I discussed above that will 
              continue to hasten in the decades ahead.&#160; The continued acceleration 
              of many intertwined technologies are roads paved with gold (I use 
              the plural here because <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is clearly not a single path).&#160; 
              In a competitive environment, it is an economic imperative to go 
              down these roads.&#160; Relinquishing technological advancement would 
              be economic suicide for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, companies, and nations.&#160; </p>
<h3>The <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">Relinquishment</a> Issue</h3>
<p>This brings us to the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s 
              most controversial recommendation and personal commitment.&#160;&#160; I do 
              feel that <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> at the right level is part of a responsible 
              and constructive response to these genuine perils.&#160; The issue, however, 
              is exactly this: at what level are we to relinquish <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>?&#160; 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/kaczynski_entry.html">Ted Kaczynski</a> would have us renounce all of it.&#160; This, in my view, 
              is neither desirable nor feasible, and the futility of such a position 
              is only underscored by the senselessness of Kaczynski's deplorable 
              tactics.&#160; There are other voices, less reckless than Kaczynski, 
              who are nonetheless arguing for broad-based <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; 
              Bill McKibben, the environmentalist who was one of the first to 
              warn against <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>, takes the position that "environmentalists 
              must now grapple squarely with the idea of a world that has enough 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and enough technological capability, and should not pursue 
              more."&#160; In my view, this position ignores the extensive suffering 
              that remains in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> world, which we will be in a position 
              to alleviate through continued technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Another level would be to forego certain fields -- <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              for example -- that might be regarded as too dangerous.&#160; But such 
              sweeping strokes of <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> are equally untenable.&#160; As I 
              pointed out above, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is simply the inevitable end result 
              of the persistent trend towards <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> that pervades all 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; It is far from a single centralized effort, but 
              is being pursued by a myriad of projects with many diverse goals.

<p>The observer I am quoting is, again, <a class="thought" href="entries/kaczynski_entry.html">Ted Kaczynski</a>.&#160; Although one 
              will properly resist Kaczynski as an authority, I believe he is

              However, Kaczynski and I clearly part company on our overall assessment 
              on the relative balance between the two.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> and I have dialogued 
              on this issue both publicly and privately, and we both believe that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will and should <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, and that we need to be actively 
              concerned with the dark side.&#160; If Bill and I disagree, it's on the 
              granularity of <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> that is both feasible and desirable.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Abandonment of broad areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will only push them underground 
              where development would continue unimpeded by <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> and regulation.&#160; 
              In such a situation, it would be the less-stable, less-responsible 
              practitioners (e.g., terrorists) who would have all the expertise.&#160;&#160;&#160; 
            </p>
<p>I do think that <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> at the right level needs to be part 
              of our ethical response to the dangers of 21st century technologies.&#160; 
              One constructive example of this is the proposed ethical guideline 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a>, founded by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> pioneer Eric 
              Drexler, that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologists agree to relinquish the development 
              of physical entities that can self-replicate in a natural environment.&#160; 
              Another is a ban on self-replicating physical entities that contain 
              their own codes for <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>.&#160; In what <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologist 
              Ralph Merkle calls the "<a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>," such entities would 
              have to obtain such codes from a centralized secure <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>, which 
              would guard against undesirable replication.&#160; I discuss these guidelines 
              further below.&#160; </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> is impossible in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> world, 
              which represents at least one way in which <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> can be 
              made safer than <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; In other ways, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> is potentially 
              more dangerous because <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s can be physically stronger than 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-based entities and more intelligent.&#160; It will eventually 
              be possible to combine the two by having <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> provide 
              the codes within <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities (replacing <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>), in which case 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities can use the much safer <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>.&#160; 
              I comment further on the strengths and weaknesses of the <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> below.&#160; </p>
<p>As responsible technologies, our <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> should include such "fine-grained" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a>, among other professional ethical guidelines.&#160; Other 
              protections will need to include oversight by regulatory bodies, 
              the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-specific "immune" responses, as well 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> assisted surveillance by law enforcement organizations.&#160; 
              Many people are not aware that our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> agencies already 
              use advanced technologies such as automated word spotting to monitor 
              a substantial flow of telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s.&#160; As we go forward, 
              balancing our cherished rights of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> with our need to be protected 
              from the malicious use of powerful 21st century technologies will 
              be one of many profound challenges.&#160; This is one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that such 
              issues as an <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> "trap door" (in which law enforcement authorities 
              would have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to otherwise secure <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>) and the FBI "<a class="thought" href="entries/carnivore_entry.html">Carnivore</a>" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a>-snooping <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> have been controversial, although these controversies 
              have abated since 9-11-2001.&#160; </p>
<p>As a test case, we can take a small measure of comfort from how 
              we have dealt with one recent technological challenge.&#160; There exists 
              today a new form of fully <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> self replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> 
              that didn't exist just a few decades ago: the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>.&#160; When 
              this form of destructive intruder first appeared, strong concerns 
              were voiced that as they became more sophisticated, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s 
              had the potential to destroy the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> medium they live 
              in.&#160; Yet the "<a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>" that has evolved in response to this 
              challenge has been largely effective.&#160; Although destructive self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> entities do cause damage from <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the injury 
              is but a small fraction of the benefit we receive from the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> links that harbor them.&#160; No one would suggest 
              we do away with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>s, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 
              because of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses.&#160; </p>
<p>One might counter that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses do not have the lethal 
              potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> viruses or of destructive <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160; 
              This is not always the case; we rely on <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to monitor patients 
              in critical care units, to fly and land airplanes, to guide intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s in our current campaign in Iraq, and other "mission-critical" 
              tasks.&#160; To the extent that this is true, however, this observation 
              only strengthens my argument.&#160; The fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses are 
              not usually deadly to humans only means that more people are willing 
              to create and release them.&#160; It also means that our response to 
              the danger is that much less intense.&#160; Conversely, when it comes 
              to self-replicating entities that are potentially lethal on a large 
              scale, our response on all levels will be vastly more serious, as 
              we have seen since 9-11.&#160; </p>
<p>I would describe our response to <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s as effective 
              and successful.&#160; Although they remain (and always will remain) a 
              concern, the danger remains at a nuisance level.&#160; Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that 
              this success is in an industry in which there is no regulation, 
              and no certification for practitioners.&#160; This largely unregulated 
              industry is also enormously productive.&#160; One could argue that it 
              has contributed more to our technological and economic <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              than any other enterprise in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.&#160;&#160; I discuss the issue 
              of regulation further below. </p>
<h3>Development of Defensive Technologies and the Impact of Regulation</h3>
<p>Joy's treatise is effective because he paints a picture of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              dangers as if they were released on today's unprepared world.&#160; The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that the sophistication and power of our defensive technologies 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> will grow along with the dangers.&#160; When we have "gray 
              goo" (unrestrained <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> replication), we will also have "blue 
              goo" ("police" <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s that combat the "bad" <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s).&#160; The story 
              of the 21<sup>st</sup> century has not yet been written, so we cannot 
              say with assurance that we will successfully avoid all misuse.&#160; 
              But the surest way to prevent the development of the defensive technologies 
              would be to relinquish the pursuit of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in broad areas.&#160; 
              We have been able to largely control harmful <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> replication 
              because the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is widely available to responsible 
              practitioners.&#160; Attempts to restrict this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> would have created 
              a far less stable situation.&#160; Responses to new challenges would 
              have been far slower, and it is likely that the balance would have 
              shifted towards the more destructive applications (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              viruses).&#160; </p>
<p>The challenge most immediately in front of us is not self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, but rather self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; The 
              next two decades will be the golden age of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, whereas 
              the comparable era for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will follow in the 2020s and 
              beyond.&#160; We are now in the early stages of a transforming <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              based on the intersection of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.&#160; We 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> the "<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>" <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> processes.&#160; 
              By reprogramming the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes that lead to and encourage 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and aging, we will have the ability to overcome these afflictions.&#160; 
              However, the same <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> can also empower a terrorist to create 
              a bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>As we compare the success we have had in controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses to the coming challenge of controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> viruses, we are struck with one <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> difference.&#160; 
              As I noted above, the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> industry is almost completely unregulated.&#160; 
              The same is obviously not the case for <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; <u>A bioterrorist 
              does not need to put his "innovations" through the FDA</u>.&#160; However, 
              we do require the scientists developing the defensive technologies 
              to follow the existing regulations, which slow down the innovation 
              process at every step.&#160; Moreover, it is impossible, under existing 
              regulations and ethical standards, to test defenses to bioterrorist 
              agents.&#160; There is already extensive discussion to modify these regulations 
              to allow for <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> models and simulations to replace infeasible 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> trials.&#160; This will be necessary, but I believe we will need 
              to go beyond these steps to accelerate the development of vitally 
              needed defensive technologies.&#160; </p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s I have articulated above, stopping these technologies 
              is not feasible, and pursuit of such broad forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> 
              will only distract us from the vital task in front of us.&#160; In terms 
              of public policy, the task at hand is to rapidly develop the defensive 
              steps needed, which include ethical standards, legal standards, 
              and defensive technologies.&#160; It is quite clearly a race.&#160; As I noted, 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> field, the defensive technologies have remained 
              a step ahead of the offensive ones.&#160; With the extensive regulation 
              in the medical field slowing down innovation at each stage, we cannot 
              have the same confidence with regard to the abuse of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>In the current environment, when one person dies in gene therapy 
              trials, there are congressional investigations and all gene therapy 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> comes to a temporary halt.&#160; There is a legitimate need 
              to make biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> as safe as possible, but our balancing 
              of risks is completely off.&#160; The millions of people who desperately 
              need the advances to be made available by gene therapy and other 
              breakthrough <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> advances appear to carry little political 
              weight against a handful of well-publicized casualties from the 
              inevitable risks of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.</p>
<p>This equation will become even more stark when we consider the 
              emerging dangers of bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s. &#160;What is needed is 
              a change in public attitude in terms of tolerance for needed risk.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Hastening defensive technologies is absolutely vital to our security.&#160; 
              We need to streamline regulatory procedures to achieve this.&#160; However, 
              we also need to greatly increase our investment explicitly in the 
              defensive technologies.&#160; In the <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> field, this means 
              the rapid development of antiviral medications.&#160; We will not have 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to develop specific countermeasures for each new challenge 
              that comes along.&#160; We are close to developing more generalized antiviral 
              technologies, and these need to be accelerated.</p>
<p>I have addressed here the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> because that is 
              the threshold and challenge that we now face.&#160; The comparable situation 
              will exist for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> once replication of nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              entities has been achieved.&#160; As that threshold comes closer, we 
              will then need to invest specifically in the development of defensive 
              technologies, including the creation of a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-based immune 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> and other observers have pointed out that such 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> would itself be a danger because of the potential 
              of "autoimmune" reactions (i.e., the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> using its powers 
              to attack the world it is supposed to be defending).&#160; </p>
<p>However, this observation is not a compelling <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to avoid the 
              creation of an <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>.&#160; No one would argue that humans would 
              be better off without an <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> because of the possibility 
              of auto immune <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s.&#160; Although the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> can itself 
              be a danger, humans would not last more than a few weeks (barring 
              extraordinary efforts at isolation) without one.&#160; The development 
              of a technological <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will happen 
              even without explicit efforts to create one.&#160; We have effectively 
              done this with regard to <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses.&#160; We created a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> not through a formal grand design project, but 
              rather through our incremental responses to each new challenge.&#160; 
              We can expect the same thing will happen as challenges from <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              based dangers emerge.&#160; The point for public policy will be to specifically 
              invest in these defensive technologies.&#160; </p>
<p>It is premature today to develop specific defensive <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies 
              since we can only have a general idea of what we are trying to defend 
              against.&#160; It would be similar to the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering world creating 
              defenses against <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses before the first one had been 
              created.&#160; However, there is already fruitful dialogue and discussion 
              on anticipating this issue, and significantly expanded investment 
              in these efforts is to be encouraged.&#160; </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a>, for example, has 
              devised a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of ethical standards and strategies for assuring the 
              development of safe <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.&#160; These guidelines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> "Artificial replicators must not be capable of replication 
                  in a natural, uncontrolled environment."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> within the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of a self-replicating manufacturing 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is discouraged."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "MNT (molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>) designs should specifically 
                  limit proliferation and provide traceability of any replicating 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Distribution of molecular manufacturing development capability 
                  should be restricted whenever possible, to responsible actors 
                  that have agreed to the guidelines.&#160; No such restriction need 
                  apply to end products of the development process."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other strategies that the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> has proposed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> Replication should require materials not found in the natural 
                  environment.&#160; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Manufacturing (replication) should be separated from the functionality 
                  of end products.&#160; Manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s can create end products, 
                  but cannot replicate themselves, and end products should have 
                  no replication capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Replication should require replication codes that are encrypted, 
                  and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> limited.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> mentioned earlier 
                  is an example of this recommendation.&#160; </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These guidelines and strategies are likely to be effective with 
              regarding to preventing accidental release of dangerous self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> entities.&#160; The situation with regard to intentional 
              design and release of such entities is more complex and more challenging.&#160; 
              We can anticipate approaches that would have the potential to defeat 
              each of these layers of protections by a sufficiently determined 
              and destructive opponent.&#160; </p>
<p>Take, for example, the <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>.&#160; When properly designed, 
              each <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is unable to replicate without first obtaining replication 
              codes.&#160; These codes are not passed on from one replication generation 
              to the next.&#160; However, a modification to such a design could bypass 
              the destruction of the replication codes and thereby pass them on 
              to the next generation.&#160; To overcome that possibility, it has been 
              recommended that the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> for the replication codes be limited 
              to only a subset of the full replication <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> so that there is insufficient 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> to pass the codes along.&#160; However, this guideline could be 
              defeated by expanding the size of the replication <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> to 
              incorporate the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>.&#160; Another protection that has been suggested 
              is to encrypt the codes and to build in protections such as <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              expiration limitations in the decryption <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.&#160; However, we can 
              see the ease with which protections against unauthorized replications 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> such as <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> files has been defeated.&#160; 
              Once replication codes and protective layers are stripped away, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can be replicated without these restrictions.&#160; </p>
<p>My point is not that protection is impossible.&#160; Rather, we need 
              to realize that any level of protection will only work to a certain 
              level of sophistication.&#160; The "meta" lesson here is that we will 
              need to continue to advance the defensive technologies, and keep 
              them one or more steps ahead of the destructive technologies.&#160; We 
              have seen <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ies to this in many areas, including technologies 
              for national defense, as well as our largely successful efforts 
              to combat <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses, that I alluded to above.&#160; </p>
<p>What we can do today with regard to the critical challenge of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is to continue the type of effective study that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> has initiated.&#160; With the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human genome project</a>, 
              three to five percent of the budgets were devoted to the ethical, 
              legal, and social implications (ELSI) of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; A similar 
              commitment for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> would be appropriate and constructive.&#160; 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> will remain a double-edged sword, and the story of the 
              21st century has not yet been written.&#160; It represents vast power 
              to be used for all humankind's purposes.&#160; We have no choice but 
              to work hard to apply these quickening technologies to advance our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> values, despite what often appears to be a lack of consensus 
              on what those values should be.&#160; </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>From "Testimony of Ray Kurzweil on the Societal Implications of Nanotechnology" I quote:
<br>
<br>
"We have a moral imperative, therefore, to continue the pursuit of knowledge and advanced technologies..."
<br>
<br>
I do not mean to argue with this.  What I would like to ask you, Ray, has to do with the meaning of the word 'moral'.  It is interesting to me that I did not find a definition in The Brain section of this site.  Yet morals are the foundation according to which we make important choices, such as how to handle technological progress.  But how do we choose our morals?  This should might seem a strange question, so let me elaborate.
<br>
<br>
One could trace the development of the concept of morals through the social evolution of our species, and thus explain them away.  But that does not deal with the question of justifying any given set of morals.  While one could use science to explain how morals arose, and quantitatively compare the outcomes of moral decisions, one cannot derive some absolute set of morals.  The subjective nature of morals presents a problem when dealing with accelerating technological progress.
<br>
<br>
As progress changes the world, situations can arise sufficiently different from what has historically occurred so that existing moral ideas are obsolete.  Consider for example the difficulty in moral thinking about the common example that goes something like: if you replace someone's neurons one by one by nanomachines until eventually all are replaced, how is that different from first scanning the brain and building a nanotechnology based functionally equivalent device and then killing the person?
<br>
Now, perhaps historically moral concepts have slowly changed to fit changing social environments; thus, one might argue that there is no problem: we'll simply continue to adapt as progress continues to change our world.  But that is an explanation of what may happen, not a justification for new morals.  And the problem is exactly that, how can you justify a particular direction of change for morals, when your basis for justification are the morals themselves???  An analogy (not very good, but I'm too tired to think of a better one) would be a genetic algorithm that has population members choose their own fitness function (and to extend the analogy even further, in this case there is no alternative, since there does not exist a 'proper' fitness function -- no absolute moral standards).
<br>
<br>
In any case, my apologies if I did not make myself as clear as I intendet, I was up all night...</p></td>

In any technologically advancing civilization there may be that one single discovery or creation that wipes out the species. It may be a simple combination of chemicals that sets the sky on fire or it may be a self-replicating nanobot that fills every square inch of space on the planet with butterscotch pudding. I don't know what it might be but until we have evidence that an advanced civilization can exist I'm just hoping that it's quick and painless...
