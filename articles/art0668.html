<p>Is the advent of, and mass availability of, desktop personal nanofactories 
              (PNs) [1] likely to cause deflation (a persistent decline in the 
              general prices of goods and services), <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> (a persistent general 
              price increase), or neither? </p>
<p>A definitive analysis would have to address: (1) the technical 
              assumptions that are made, including as yet imprecisely defined 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technological advances and the pace and <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of their introduction;

              to guide us; (3) the counter-leaning responses of existing power

              potential dilution of their power, influence, or interests, including 
              their likely efforts to actively oppose or at least delay this potential

              may have changed.</p>
<p>A definitive answer is beyond the scope of this essay. Here, we 
              take only a first look at the question.</p>
<h4>Price/Performance Assumptions</h4>
<p>Our preliminary analysis begins with an assumption that at the 
              end of a 20-year period of introduction, almost every household 
              in a given developed country has purchased a PN. The PN will be 
              capable of building any manner of consumer goods using simple molecular 
              feedstock such as acetylene or propane gas that will be piped into 
              the home via a <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> connection, similar to present-day hookups 
              that deliver natural gas, water, and electricity. There are other 
              delivery scenarios such as bottled gas feedstock, and more self-sufficient 
              feedstock provisioning scenarios such as nanoblock premanufacturing, 
              solar-powered recycling, biomass/biowaste extraction, or even atmospheric 
              extraction, but these will be <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> aside here both in the interest 
              of simplicity and because they may be heavily regulated [2] or in 
              some cases even declared illegal [3].</p>
<p>If we further assume that (1) the price to acquire the PN is approximately 
              US$4400 (see below), (2) the PN has a mass of 10 kg and produces 
              consumer products at the rate of 1 kg/hr [1], and (3) the PN is 
              operated 50% of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> throughout a useful lifetime of 10 years, 
              then the PN during its useful <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> produces 44,000 kg of consumer 
              products which then have an amortized capital cost of $0.10/kg, 
              a cost that is built into every product manufactured by the PN.</p>
<p>The $4400 price point for the PN was taken as a plausible figure 
              that might reasonably be chosen by a U.S. manufacturer. This price 
              point cannot be too cheap or there is no profit, nor too expensive 
              or there are no buyers. For comparison, $4400 will purchase a good 
              quality large-screen TV, a high-end refrigerator/freezer, or a topnotch 
              laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in the U.S. today. The PN will be a versatile appliance, 
              able to manufacture whatever is deemed legal in the 21st century 
              such as: (1) consumer goods including nondurables such as food and 
              durables heavily laden with nanosensors, nanomotors, nanopumps and 
              nanocomputers, (2) all the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>ed sheets or chunks of diamond 
              that anyone might want, and (3) some kinds of medical nanorobots 
              for personal use, though these may be heavily regulated. We assume 
              that the PN will not be allowed to manufacture contraband, nor various 
              types of <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s systems including ecophages [4], or more PNs (which 
              would nullify the R&amp;D funding and manufacturing business model). 
              If the public is not allowed to manufacture PNs using PNs [5], then 
              the production cost of a PN using a PN becomes almost irrelevant 
              to the retail price of a PN. The manufacturer may charge $4400 for 
              a PN even if it only costs them $10 to make one (see below), using 
              the difference to pay for showrooms and sales staff, marketing and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">advertising</a>, legal costs for defending the brand and a monopolistic 
              pricing regime, product liability insurance costs (which could be 
              substantial), warranty and servicing costs, online and print publications 
              including consumer how-to books and magazines, websites and online 
              help desks, executive overhead and corporate perks, and perhaps 
              modest dividends from profits for the shareholders.</p>
<p>Assuming the average person in the developed world consumes 2000 
              kcal/day of food, and taking the average <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> density of food 
              (arbitrarily weighting <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>:carbohydrate:fat in a 4:3:3 ratio) 
              as 24 million J/kg [6], then the person is consuming about 130 kg/yr 
              of food. Further assuming this average person consumes four grocery 
              bagfuls per week of nondurables with each bag containing 2 kg of 
              useful product, then the average person requires 400 kg/yr of consumer 
              nondurables (of which 130 kg/yr is food). The PN is assumed to produce 
              4400 kg/yr of consumer products. Given that the average person in 
              an industrialized economy needs 400 kg/yr of nondurables, or 1600 
              kg/yr for a household of four people, this leaves 2800 kg/yr either 
              for increased nondurables consumption or for the manufacture of 
              desired consumer durables. Durables might include clothing, appliances, 
              furniture, and cars. Large automobiles that weigh 2000 kg today 
              might weigh as little as 200 kg if made of much stronger diamondoid 
              materials [7], so the production budget would allow up to 14 diamondoid 
              cars per year to be built. Thus, a single PN per household with 
              the above <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s is probably sufficient to satisfy all reasonable 
              household needs for residents of industrialized countries.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Cost of PN-Manufactured Goods</h4>
<p>The base operating cost of a working PN, and hence the price of 
              anything that can be manufactured by the nanofactory, should approximate 
              the cost of the material and energy inputs. Of course, &#8220;cost&#8221; 
              is not price&#8212;in a capitalist economy, prices of goods are set 
              by competitive markets. In a stable equilibrium economy, the price 
              of manufactured goods that are in demand cannot long persist below 
              the base cost of the material inputs. But added to those base input 
              costs, and hence indirectly added to the price of a good, will also 
              be various intangible costs, which for the PN might include some 
              or all of the following:</p>
<p>(1) acquisition financing or opportunity costs;</p>
<p>(2) PN licensing costs;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) the cost of product-description <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> not in the public 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> (e.g., IP fees, per-use fees, per-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> fees);</p>
<p>(4) <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s toll charges for PN data links, with flat baseline 
              fee varying by transmission speed, fidelity, security, and availability 
              for product data <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>s;</p>
<p>(5) fee for dangerous-product construction blocking (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>al, 
              parental);</p>
<p>(6) fee for contraband or socially-taboo construction blocking 
              (e.g., governmental, parental, religious, etc.);</p>
<p>(7) regulatory costs (e.g., environmental impact/mitigation, thermal 
              pollution credits, <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> policing, federal mandates enforcement);</p>
<p>(8) federal/state taxes (e.g., sales/use, value-added, property, 
              excise, luxury, inheritance, estate, gift, etc.), State Nanofactory 
              Commission tax, and surcharges for unrelated social purposes;</p>
<p>(9) local taxes (e.g., feedstock fire services, toxic gas mitigation, 
              metering services, low-income subsidies, universal <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> subsidies, 
              9-1-1 emergency phone <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> fees);</p>
<p>(10) federal protective trade and domestic subsidy-support tariffs;</p>
<p>(11) federal economic stabilization surcharges;</p>
<p>(12) fee for regular government-mandated safety inspections, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous 
              to annual smog inspections commonly required for automobiles;</p>
<p>(13) international surcharge for disadvantaged nations, administrated 
              through United Nations auspices (perhaps imposed as single fee collected 
              at time of sale, or paid as annual international tax);</p>
<p>(14) registration fee for all PNs, analogous to automobile registration 
              fees;</p>
<p>(15) the cost of government mandated insurance for accidents or 
              injuries to others as a result of products manufactured by the PN, 
              similar to the automobile personal injury insurance required in 
              many states; and</p>
<p>(16) miscellaneous other fees and expenses. A precise quantification 
              or estimate of all these costs cannot easily be made, but prorated 
              intangible costs of at least $0.20/kg appear plausible [8].</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This means that even if the cost of material and energy inputs 
              fell to essentially zero&#8212;say, through the use of recyclable 
              nanoblocks that could create the potential for cheap disassembly 
              and re-use of nanoblocks, thus recovering the majority of the energy 
              investment in a given amount of diamondoid mass&#8212;there would 
              still be an amortized capital cost of $0.10/kg plus a fixed intangible 
              cost of $0.20/kg built into all products manufactured by the PN, 
              giving an irreducible total minimum cost of $0.30/kg. (The fixed 
              intangible $0.20/kg <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> should prove relatively insensitive 
              to fluctuations in the general price level.)</p>
<p>Bulk petroleum-based hydrocarbon gases like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) 
              or propane (<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a><sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) can cost as little as ~$0.17/kg 
              [9a] or ~$0.31/kg [9b], respectively, at wholesale, but the retail 
              price for home delivery&amp;#8212as would be required to supply a PN&#8212;was 
              $2/gallon for liquefied propane gas in December 2005, or $0.90/kg. 
              Nanofactories may need to be restricted to such feedstocks for reasons 
              of public safety (because development of more flexible feedstock 
              technologies might facilitate malicious development of self-replicating 
              systems [10], e.g., by using nanofactories to construct them). For 
              a complete PN feedstock gas, small amounts of other gases containing 
              additional non-<a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms needed for mechanosynthetic processes 
              still must be added to the mix, raising feedstock costs by an additional 
              but unknown amount&amp;#8212for example, $1.50/kg for <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> (H<sub>2</sub>) 
              gas, $110/kg for Si atoms in silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), $354/kg for 
              P atoms in phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>), and $1150/kg for Ge atoms 
              [11].</p>
<p>Theoretical studies of diamond mechanosynthesis [12] often assume 
              the use of a more chemically convenient carbon-rich hydrogen-poor 
              precursor carbon-source <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> such as acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>). 
              Note that the chemical energy of all the interatomic bonds in one 
              kilogram of acetylene is about 67 MJ, implying a relatively low 
              theoretical cost of $1.85/kg at the current electricity price of 
              ~$0.10/kW-hr, even though large-volume commercial acetylene prices 
              are typically $18/kg [13] because of costly special tanks required 
              by law for the safe transport of this unstable high-energy gas.</p>
<p>If electricity could be obtained more cheaply, then in principle 
              the cost of acetylene could fall accordingly. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, if electricity 
              costs dropped 10-fold to $0.01/kW-hr, then acetylene costs could 
              fall to $0.185/kg, and ignoring the cost of ancillary non-hydrocarbon 
              gases the minimum total cost of PN manufactures would then decline 
              to $0.185/kg + $0.10/kg (capital cost) + $0.20/kg (intangibles) 
              = $0.485/kg. If electricity costs dropped 100-fold to $0.001/kW-hr, 
              then acetylene costs could fall to $0.0185/kg, implying a total 
              cost for PN manufactures (again ignoring the cost of ancillary gases) 
              of at least $0.3185/kg. The cost of electricity cannot as a practical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> decline to zero [14] because energy is an inherently scarce 
              resource, electrical generators have input material costs and fixed 
              capital/site expenses, transmission lines require maintenance, waste 
              heat and other pollution byproducts must be properly disposed of, 
              natural environments should not be despoiled, and so forth. But 
              even if the cost of electricity did fall to zero, the total cost 
              of PN manufactures would still be at least ~$0.30/kg as noted earlier.</p>
<p>Supporting the plausibility of our assumption of a future ~$0.10/kW-hr 
              electricity price is the historical fact that U.S. prices of electricity 
              in nominal dollars have been remarkably constant over the last 100 
              years. This period has seen economic booms and depressions, war 
              and peace, and tremendous technological change and gains in industrial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a>. Specifically, the average price in nominal dollars 
              for delivered U.S. residential electricity was $0.105/kW-hr in 1907 
              [15] and $0.099/kW-hr in August 2005 [16]&#8212;that is, no change. 
              (The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen 22-fold during this 
              same period which means that the real cost of residential electricity 
              has declined 22-fold over the last 100 years, but the nominal price 
              has stayed constant at 10 cents. Industrial electricity prices have 
              behaved similarly.) We can consider an idealized alternative scenario 
              for decentralized energy production in which solar energy is captured 
              by inexpensive thin solar panels placed as ground cover over cheaply-priced 
              vacant rural land, initially bringing the cost of solar-derived 
              electricity down to ~$0.001/kW-hr [17]. Since this cheap electricity 
              can be immediately resold at the prevailing $0.10/kW-hr price in 
              competition with existing utility suppliers, a likely rapid escalation 
              of free-market vacant land values or the imposition of regulatory/protectionist 
              tariffs by government should quickly close much if not most of the 
              price gap. Of course, environmentalists may prevent the project 
              from going forward at all for a variety of reasons&#8212;such as 
              (1) the possible <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of covered vegetation due to sunlight deprivation; 
              (2) the alteration of local weather patterns and watershed hydrodynamics 
              including soil drainage, erosion, and water tables; (3) the destruction 
              of natural &#8220;view easements&#8221; with solar collectors that 
              are aesthetic eyesores; (4) the interference with <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> and bird 
              navigation; and so forth. Ocean-based solar collection systems have 
              similar costs with different sets of environmental issues.</p>
<p>Optimistically assuming that feedstock gases can be purchased by 
              the consumer for a delivered price of $0.70/kg, and adding in the 
              amortized initial capital outlay of $0.10/kg to buy the PN, and 
              another $0.20/kg for prorated intangible costs, then the cost of 
              manufacturing consumer products using a personal nanofactory should 
              be about $1/kg. This is moderately cheaper than the current cost 
              of nondurables like bread and meat at the grocery store ($3-$5/kg) 
              [9b, 18], and 2-3 orders of magnitude cheaper than the current cost 
              of commonplace durables such as a good pair of shoes ($100/kg) or 
              a good laptop computer ($1000/kg) [9b]. Supplemental licensing fees, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> restrictions, taxes, regulatory tariffs and 
              so forth may drive up the cost of some luxury or specialty items 
              to well above the $1/kg price of manufactured goods, but the current 
              prices of expensive items such as beluga caviar ($796/kg), pearls 
              ($27,000/kg) and <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> interferon ($190,000,000/kg) [9b] 
              (all made from intrinsically cheap atoms) also have room to fall 
              many orders of magnitude. Over time, most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> consumer goods should 
              become commoditized with prices asymptotically approaching production 
              + capital + intangibles costs, though perhaps with some government 
              tariffs on personal manufacturing zeroed out on basic staples and 
              necessities to accommodate the neediest citizens.</p>
<p>A sudden lowering of manufacturing costs might lead to deflation. 
              An interesting historical precedent for <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-driven hyperdeflation 
              of a commodity price is the example of aluminum metal. During most 
              of the 1800s, aluminum could only be produced commercially using 
              an expensive chemical process involving highly reactive alkali metals. 
              As late as 1884, the pure <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> still was regarded as a precious 
              metal with a price of $16/pound, equivalent to $23/oz in current 
              2006 dollars. Aluminum was used for fine tableware (much like sterling 
              silver, then and today) and the metal was chosen to cast the small 
              pyramidal cap atop the Washington Monument [19]. In 1886 a cheap 
              new electrolytic technology called the Hall process was discovered 
              which by 1914 had sent the price of the pure metal plunging to just 
              $0.19/lb, a price floor determined by the cost of electricity. This 
              represents a nearly 100-fold single-commodity price hyperdeflation 
              in less than 3 decades&#8212;the technology-enabled price drop could 
              occur because aluminum atoms are plentiful and widespread in nature, 
              unlike, say, gold atoms [24]. Still, a bit of perspective is needed 
              here. Average U.S. consumer prices have only risen 50-fold during 
              the last 300 years and 10-fold in the last 60 years [20], a +4%/yr 
              long-term rate in modern times; the U.K. has a similar record. The 
              sharpest general price deflation in U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> occurred during 
              1780-89 when prices declined 100-fold from temporarily inflated 
              Revolutionary War profiteering highs [20]. But except in similar 
              cases involving bursting economic bubbles, deflations are generally 
              mild and rare&amp;#8212across the worldwide Great Depression during 
              1920-1933, U.S. consumer prices dropped by -35% (not even 2-fold) 
              [20].</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of the above considerations, a conservative assumption 
              is that the introduction of personal nanofactories over a time period 
              lasting, say, two decades will result in the average prices of consumer 
              nondurables falling perhaps 5-fold from today&#8217;s prices, and 
              the average prices of consumer durables falling perhaps 100-fold.</p>
<p>How will this affect the overall inflation rate? Perhaps surprisingly, 
              not much.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>The Deflationary Impulse</h4>
<p>In the 2005 U.S. economy, consumer durables accounted for 12.8% 
              of all Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), nondurables were 
              29.0% of PCE, and services were 58.2% of PCE [21]. If the aforementioned 
              5-fold and 100-fold price declines occur over a 20-year period during 
              which PNs are introduced at a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> rate of market penetration 
              growing from 0% to 100%, and if the services component of PCE continues 
              to inflate at the long-term historical +4%/yr rate, then the net 
              inflation rate for all of PCE falls from +4%/yr in the last year 
              prior to PN introduction to +1.4%/yr during the 20 year period in 
              which PNs are introduced into the economy. In other words, there 
              is no actual deflation, just -2.6%/yr worth of disinflation. By 
              the end of the 20-year PN introduction period, services make up 
              95.5% of the private consumption economy, nondurables are 4.4% of 
              PCE, and durables have almost vanished at 0.1% of PCE. In year 21, 
              inflation returns to the long-term historical +4%/yr trendline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what effect PNs might have on inflation in the 
              service sector [22]. On the one hand, it can be argued that services 
              may <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> some disinflation during the PN introduction period 
              because PNs in the hands of service providers will make those businesses 
              more efficient, hence able to lower their prices for competitive 
              advantage. On the other hand, the principal determinant of the price 
              of services is the cost of human labor. With workers generally more 
              affluent and less desperate for necessities, labor wage rates might 
              actually need to rise, not fall, to induce PN-goods-satiated indolent 
              citizens to remain in, or return to, the workforce. Of course, if 
              most services no longer needed to be provided by humans&amp;#8212e.g., 
              if most services could be provided by <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>-enabled robotic slaves 
              cheaply manufactured by PNs, thus allowing humans to become pure 
              consumers with no need to produce anything of value or to serve 
              anyone&#8212;then the value of human labor would have effectively 
              fallen close to zero and the cost of services would then fall to 
              the same degree as durable goods, since robots and AI-embedded computers 
              are also durable goods. The degree to which humans will find <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>-only 
              services to be socially and aesthetically acceptable is unclear, 
              as is the legal status of enslaved AI-enabled robotic &#8220;persons&#8221; 
              [52], and both issues are beyond the scope of this essay.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>The Inflationary Impulse</h4>
<p>However, this is not the end of the story. Much like the extreme 
              but narrow economic dislocations experienced by developed countries 
              when suddenly confronted with cheaper external sources of goods 
              (often causing companies to outsource), personal nanofactories are 
              the economic equivalent of below-cost trade competition for most 
              retail manufactured products. One likely result is that much of 
              the manufacturing, agriculture and wholesale/retail trade sectors 
              (about 40% of all employment in developed economies [20]) could 
              face continuing downsizing pressures throughout the 20-year introduction 
              period of the PNs. Up to 40% of all workers could be affected and 
              they may experience wage stagnation, job loss, and a need for additional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> or retraining for gainful employment in the service sector&#8212;much 
              as displaced agricultural workers fled to the manufacturing sector 
              a century ago.</p>
<p>Consider the likely governmental response to these displacements. 
              If a significant fraction of manufacturing-sector employees lose 
              their jobs and thus have no money to pay for necessities, then as 
              their unemployment or union benefits and savings become exhausted 
              these people will naturally turn to the government for further assistance 
              during their period of career realignment.</p>
<p>They will demand to receive transfer payments of subsistence cash 
              to buy the commodity goods (e.g., food, clothing) and services (especially 
              nanomedical care) that they need but can no longer afford. Politicians 
              will feel little restraint against printing money as fast as it 
              is needed to make voters whole, equivalent to Milton Friedman&#8217;s 
              famous proposed &#8220;helicopter drop&#8221; of cash [23].</p>
<p>This forced expansion of the money supply will be inflationary. 
              But by how much? In the scenario analyzed earlier, over a 20-year 
              PN introduction period the economy loses a combined average of $160B/yr 
              in consumer spending on durables and nondurables, rather than gaining 
              a combined average of $220B/yr that would have occurred in the absence 
              of the PNs. In the simplest case, the government (using the United 
              States as an example) would just issue the swing difference ($380B/yr) 
              as direct grants to displaced people in the affected industries. 
              This would increase the current <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate of the 2005 U.S. M2 
              money supply from $300B/yr (+5%/yr) to $680B/yr (+10%/yr), perhaps 
              adding about +5%/yr to the annual CPI inflation rate (assuming for 
              simplicity no multiplier effect) during the 20-year PN introduction 
              period. Combining this new government-induced inflation with the 
              disinflation of -2.6%/yr caused by the rapid fall in the prices 
              of PN-manufactured goods (see above) gives a net inflation rate 
              increase of +2.4%/yr, i.e., from the current +3%/yr rate to a slightly 
              higher +5.4%/yr rate of U.S. consumer price inflation. The macroeconomic 
              effects of this change might be hardly noticeable to non-economists.</p>
<p>Even this small increment to the CPI inflation rate can be entirely 
              neutralized (at least on an economy-wide basis) if the government 
              increases the M2 money supply growth by only an average of $200B/yr 
              (rather than $380B/yr) of direct grants of assistance to displaced 
              workers. In this case, the +2.6%/yr inflationary impact of increased 
              government outlays would exactly counterbalance the -2.6%/yr deflationary 
              impact of the PNs on the general price level, resulting in a zero 
              net change in the overall inflation rate. The missing $180B/yr not 
              directly paid to the displaced workers would be offset in most cases 
              by the incremental appreciation of tangible assets owned by them, 
              that cannot readily be manufactured by nanofactories with any clear 
              cost advantage (e.g., houses (whose conventional manufacturing cost 
              is already $1/kg [9c]), land and other real estate, precious metals 
              [24], and so forth). The 2004 U.S. national home ownership rate 
              was 69.0% [25], and an extra +2.6%/yr of general inflation applied 
              to the current $19.1T worth of owned residential real estate [26] 
              amounts to an annual appreciation gain of $500B/yr.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Deflation and Inflation Can Be Balanced through Government <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">Action</a></h4>
<p>Note that because government has the ability to &#8220;lean against 
              the wind,&#8221; then, within broad limits, the inflationary effects 
              of increased government outlays can always absorb the deflationary 
              effects of PNs, even if cheaper electricity allows the cost of PN-made 
              goods to fall from $1/kg to the irreducible minimum of $0.30/kg. 
              The same result occurs if PNs are introduced into the economy over 
              a period substantially shorter than 20 years. For example, a faster 
              10-year introduction period produces a mild -0.8%/yr deflation over 
              that period [27]. In this case, the +4.8%/yr inflationary impact 
              of $365B/yr of increased government outlays would exactly counterbalance 
              the -4.8%/yr deflationary impact of the PNs on the general price 
              level, again resulting in a zero net change in the overall inflation 
              rate.</p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, an unrealistically fast 1-year introduction 
              period of PNs would produce a 1-year -33.5%/yr deflation rate (in 
              the absence of any government response), almost exactly matching 
              the total peak-to-valley deflation that was recorded during the 
              Great Depression (see above). But rather than allowing money supply 
              to naturally decline as in the 1930s (which enhanced the contraction 
              in real economic growth), this time the governmental monetary authorities 
              would probably increase the M2 money supply to match the $3,320B 
              in lost final sales. That&#8217;s the equivalent of handing every 
              man, woman, and child in the U.S. a check for $11,600. The one-time 
              stimulative action would increase the M2 money supply by about +50.1% 
              in a single year.</p>
<p>Such stimuli are not unprecedented in U.S. economic history [28]. 
              For instance, a two-year +50.1% M2 increase during 1942-44 at the 
              beginning of WWII produced only +4%/yr CPI inflation in those years, 
              in part due to the simultaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation of price controls 
              [15, 20]. A one-year +60.6% increase in total U.S. currency during 
              1862-63 at the beginning of the Civil War produced +23%/yr CPI inflation 
              across those years, though by 1878 consumer prices had returned 
              back down to 1862 levels [15, 20].</p>
<p>In the above worst-case scenario, the one-time issuance of government 
              largesse would permanently balloon federal debt [29] from $7,900B 
              (2005) to $11,200B in a single year. Assuming interest rates remain 
              roughly unchanged along with the inflation rate (since interest 
              rates loosely track the inflation rate), federal interest payments 
              on the debt [30] would only rise from $350B/yr (2005) to $500B/yr, 
              a $150B/yr federal budget expenditure increase that seems modest 
              in comparison to the usual $3,900B/yr (2005) in U.S. federal outlays 
              [31]. Even a modest increase in long-term interest rates, due to 
              the increased debt level, is probably tolerable to the federal budget. 
              In the low-probability 1-year PN introduction scenario, federal 
              outlays would spike +85%, from $3,900B to $7,220B for one year, 
              but this is historically comparable to the +51% increase in federal 
              outlays during 1862-63 and the +172% increase in federal outlays 
              during 1942-44.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Deflationary forces driven by advances in molecular manufacturing 
              (MM) can be opposed by inflationary forces competently initiated 
              by governmental monetary authorities. This allows the two forces 
              to remain roughly in balance, with the incremental inflation at 
              the general price level remaining close to zero as PNs are introduced. 
              Since an MM-rich economy will be dominated by services and information, 
              not goods, our expectation is that the prices of services and information 
              might rise very slightly as the prices of PN-manufactured goods 
              falls significantly. For example, if services and information comprise 
              95% of the economy and goods are only 5% of all sales, then a deflationary 
              -20% decline in the prices of goods can be largely offset by an 
              inflationary rise of just +1% in the prices of services and information.</p>
<p>Manufactured goods will represent a decreasing portion of the total 
              economy as PNs are introduced, hence the influence of such goods 
              on the general price level in the overall economy will tend to decline 
              as the diffusion of MM throughout the economy approaches saturation. 
              Similarly, services and information will represent an increasing 
              fraction of the total economy as PNs are introduced, eventually 
              reaching near 100%. Hence the amount of incremental inflation in 
              the prices of services and information that is required to offset 
              the deflation caused by falling goods prices will also tend to decline 
              toward zero as the diffusion of MM throughout the economy approaches 
              saturation [32].</p>
<p>Both deflationary and inflationary levers exist in the economy. 
              Either may be pulled on harder, as needed, to maintain a stable 
              price regime (or at least to ensure &#8220;soft landings&#8221;), 
              up to the point where the whole economic system breaks down. That 
              is, a monetary expansion (possibly creating soaring public debt 
              politically rationalized by a Presidential proclamation of a &#8220;War 
              on Deflation&#8221;) can continue until the required inflationary 
              counterstimulus becomes so enormous that the financial stresses 
              induced by large and rapid monetary flows literally break the economic 
              system, possibly in an extended analog of the stock market crash 
              of 19 October 1987 [33]. Quantifying this threshold systemic breakage 
              point&#8212;in both local and global economies&#8212;should be an 
              urgent matter for future econometric and <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a>-history <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>.</p>

              of the hypsithermal limit for <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, when combined with a few other 
              reasonable assumptions, suggests that a per capita allocation of 
              about 10 kg of active nanomachinery will generate about the maximum 
              amount of extra thermal pollution that our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> can handle without 
              sustaining ecological damage. This limit or something like it may 
              someday be enshrined in international law.</p>
<p>3. For example, consider the case of a private <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> who sets 
              up equipment to extract CO2 from the air and combine it with water 
              to synthesize his own acetylene gas. Authorities may not allow individuals 
              to set up unregistered and unregulated systems (i.e., acetylene 
              generator + PN) that are capable, in effect, of metabolizing air 
              into diamond. Such a system would amount to the construction of 
              an aerovore (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030024059/http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm#Sec8-2_GrayDust" target="_blank">http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm#Sec8-2_GrayDust</a>)&amp;#8212a 
              free-range replicator that can copy itself by feeding on air&amp;#8212because 
              it would be fairly trivial to miniaturize the proposed acetylene 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> system down to a micron scale system, and because basic 
              scaling designs for submicron-size self-replicating molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s 
              that use acetylene as feedstock have already been published (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030024059/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm" target="_blank">http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm</a>). 
              Since the proposed system, once miniaturized, could be used to effectuate 
              a &#8220;gray dust&#8221; scenario thus precipitating a global ecological 
              catastrophe, it is likely that systems of this type (and their obvious 
              precursors) may be deemed illegal except when deployed in highly 
              regulated and extensively monitored (probably government) facilities, 
              probably with an international supervisory body such as the IAEA 
              continuously watching the entire proceedings via ubiquitous cameras. 
              Because of the ecophagic risks, the building of such a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> by

<p>5. It seems unreasonable to presume that the existing capitalist 
              power <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> will knowingly fund the development, and then later 
              willingly allow the widespread sale and unrestricted use, of a product 
              which has no economic value whatsoever to capitalist manufacturers&amp;#8212and 
              even worse, will likely threaten the economic value of all other 
              product lines of all manufacturers. It may be hard to make money 
              selling a product to consumers that can build more copies of itself, 
              thus obviating future sales. This is amply demonstrated by the commoditization 
              of agriculture, a &#8220;(bio)manufacturing&#8221; sector of the economy 
              that relies heavily on self-replicating (bio) machinery. (Observe 
              that big agribusiness survives in part by selling farmers new seeds 
              each growing season.) It is unlikely that PNs will be sold that 
              can make other PNs, because these could be a serious threat to the 
              existing capitalist system and thus will be vigorously resisted 
              by all possible means, once the power structure fully appreciates 
              the threat and believes the threat to be both possible and imminent. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">Hacker</a>-proofing is likely to be strictly enforced; the technologies 
              that will make this possible are already being developed in the 
              private sector IP area today. And governments of all types will 
              be motivated not to let their citizens have too much <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> to 
              manufacture whatever is locally defined as &#8220;contraband&#8221; 
              or &#8220;taboo&#8221;, so a fair degree of international cooperation 
              in enforcing these restrictions can be expected. Consequently, restricted-use 
              (and monitored-use, perhaps even publicly-published use) technologies 
              in the personal manufacturing area cannot be ruled out and in fact 
              seem highly probable in view of the security and economic risks.</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine an alternative scenario in which PNs 
              are given away for free, but cannot build anything unless you pay 
              a subscription fee for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and product-build instructions for 
              all the products you want, similar to the situation today in some 
              companies where <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones are given away free as a marketing ploy 
              to sell subscription services. The success of this business model 
              applied to PNs would strongly depend on the manufacturer having 
              absolutely secure control over the source, and the use, of the purchased 
              software and product-build information. We will not further evaluate 
              here the economic consequences of this or other alternative business 
              models for PNs.</p>

<p>7. The mass of diamondoid products whose utility is primarily a 
              function of their strength may decrease by between two and three 
              orders of magnitude. (If we are manufacturing food, there will likely 
              be almost zero mass <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in the products.) The only published 
              detailed design analysis for the comparative mass reduction of any 
              diamondoid products is for the respirocytes (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030024059/http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes/index.html</a>), 
              which are calculated to achieve a 1620-fold mass reduction compared 
              to a volume of red blood cells of equal functional <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. But 
              respirocytes are a microscale durable product. As of late 2005, 
              no similar detailed analysis had yet been undertaken for macroscale 
              consumer durables such as shoes, bicycles, automobiles, and the 
              like. So, while it is reasonable to assume a 10-fold mass reduction 
              in consumer durables, our ability to achieve 1000-fold mass reductions 
              in macroscale durables (e.g., a 10-gram bicycle) remains somewhat 
              speculative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another scaling issue is whether future consumer durables, fabricated 
              using molecular manufacturing (MM) techniques, will be given the 
              same functionality as today&#8217;s products, or somewhat greater 
              functionality, or will have dramatically augmented functionality 
              (superfunctionality) due to the incorporation of a significant mass 
              fraction of active nanomachinery. Over time, products will probably 
              emerge across the entire spectrum, ranging from current functionality 
              to superfunctionality.</p>
<p> In the case of MM-fabricated superfunctional nanomachinery-rich 
              consumer products, a possible further complication of reducing product 
              mass is the reduction in thermal capacity that this causes. Thermal 
              capacity can be recovered by incorporating high heat capacity bulk 
              materials such as water into the product or adding extra conductive 
              structures in contact with external heat sinks, but either solution 
              increases total product mass. Additionally, a superfunctional macroscale 
              product containing a large quantity of active simultaneously-actuated 
              nanoscale machinery can generate significant waste heat (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030024059/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/6.5.3.htm#p11" target="_blank">http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/6.5.3.htm#p11</a>)&#8212;mainly 
              from computational tasks by nanocomputers but also from some kinds 
              of mechanical tasks, both of which may employ power densities many 
              orders of magnitude larger than those commonly found in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              systems. The fraction of active nanocomponent mass that is present 
              in a superfunctional nanomachinery-rich macroscale product is a 
              design decision. This fraction may range from 0% (e.g., the product 
              is purely passive nanomaterials with no active nanocomponentry) 
              to 100% (e.g., the product is purely active nanocomponentry as is 
              approached by &#8220;utility fog&#8221;), depending on the application 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ives of the designer and his customers. For example, 
              a respirocyte will have 8.37 x 10<sup>-17</sup> kg of active nanocomponents 
              (e.g., computers, sensors, pumps, and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s) for every 3.56 x 
              10<sup>-16</sup> kg of total dry mass of final product (which includes 
              inactive mass such as hull and other support structure), so 24% 
              of the respirocyte dry mass is active nanocomponent mass. The problem 
              of heat removal for a superfunctional product of size-independent 
              power density grows more restrictive as product size increases (the 
              familiar Square-Cube law), making this a more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issue for 
              superfunctional macroscale products than for superfunctional microscale 
              products such as medical nanorobots (e.g., respirocytes). Design 
              solutions for superfunctional macroscale products incorporating 
              large mass fractions of active nanomachinery may include: (1) reducing 
              overall power density of the product, (2) reducing the fraction 
              of active nanomachinery present in the product, (3) operating active 
              nanomachinery present in the product at less than a 100% duty cycle, 
              or (4) adding cooling systems such as onboard refrigerators coupled 
              to radiators, disposable cooling packs, or hookups to external sources 
              of cooling fluids or other heat removal systems.</p>
<p>In the case of MM-fabricated consumer products having similar functionality 
              to present-day durable goods, cooling will be no more difficult 
              for these products than it is today&amp;#8212and may, in fact, be easier 
              because of the increased efficiency of nanoscale machinery compared 
              with traditional macroscale machinery. Cooling only becomes an extra 
              consideration when the designer adds significant new functionality 
              that doesn&#8217;t exist in today&#8217;s consumer products.</p>
<p>8. What is the impact of government taxation and regulation on 
              the cost of goods? There are many possible estimates, none of them 
              very precise but all suggesting a consistent range of impact on 
              costs. Starting with the broadest view, in the U.S. National Accounts 
              for 2005QIII the &#8220;taxes on production and imports less subsidies&#8221; 
              were 6.8% of Gross National Product [21], implying an equivalent 
              load on a $1/kg PN product of about $0.068/kg. Alternatively, in 
              2005QIII the total of &#8220;personal current taxes&#8221; plus &#8220;contributions 
              for government social insurance&#8221; were 20.4% of Personal Income 
              [21], which would imply an equivalent load on a $1/kg PN product 
              of about $0.204/kg. The average effective state and local tax burden 
              in the U.S. is 10.0% of income [34], which equates to a prorated 
              $0.10/kg assuming the value of PN output is treated as income at 
              $1/kg. Academic and institutional sources [35] estimate the economic 
              cost of all U.S. federal regulations during the 1995-2005 period 
              as $0.865T-$1.27T/yr, equivalent to a $0.07-$0.10/kg regulatory 
              burden on a $1/kg product.</p>
<p>In the author&#8217;s home state of California (USA), vehicle registration 
              fees are based primarily on purchase price. According to the state&#8217;s 
              online vehicle registration fee <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> [36], the purchase of 
              a new gas-powered vehicle in El Dorado County having a purchase 
              price of $4400 (identical to the purchase price posited for the 
              PN) would require payment of a total first-year registration fee 
              of $409, which includes a one-time sales/use tax of $319 on the 
              initial purchase and $90 for the first annual registration fee. 
              Over the 10-year useful life of a PN requiring registration, this 
              would amount to a total of $1219 in fees, which implies a registration 
              fee of $0.028/kg when amortized over the lifetime PN product output 
              of 44,000 kg. A listing of the items comprising the annual automobile 
              registration fee (most of which are suggestive or have obvious analogs 
              to a PN purchase) include Current Registration ($31), Vehicle License 
              Fee ($29), California Highway Patrol ($9), Smog High Polluter Repair 
              Fee ($6), Smog Abatement ($6), Air Quality Management District ($4), 
              Abandoned Vehicle Fee ($1), Auto Theft and/or DUI Crime Deterrence 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> ($1), County Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies Fee 
              ($1), Fingerprint ID Fee ($1), and Reflectorized License Plate Fee 
              ($1).</p>
<p>The author&#8217;s review of personal residential landline telephone 
              and electric bills for 2005 reveal essentially fixed government 
              fees, taxes, and other surcharges averaging $6/mo and $45/mo, respectively, 
              regardless of quantity consumed. Applying these amounts to a PN 
              producing 367 kg/mo would imply a minimum fixed burden of $0.02-$0.12/kg, 
              or higher if the full 367 kg product mass budget for the month was 
              not manufactured. Property taxes are usually imposed on a per-parcel 
              or per-house (or per floor-area) basis, regardless of the level 
              of use (e.g., ignoring number of occupants, children, cars, etc.) 
              of the real estate. An additional 1%-3%/yr personal property tax 
              imposed on a PN costing $4400 producing 4400 kg of products annually 
              would equate to a $0.01-$0.03/kg tax. Property taxes based on property 
              market value range from 0.13%-2.3% in the U.S. [34], 0.1%-2.0% in 
              Russia [37], and 1.4%-2.1% in Japan [38]; or as a percentage of 
              national income (<a class="thought" href="entries/gdp_entry.html">GDP</a>), ~1% in Germany, ~3% in France, and ~4% in 
              U.K. [39]. The City of Baltimore, MD, also assesses a 5.77% personal 
              property tax and a 5.77% utility tax [40].</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">Copyright</a> royalties for owned written intellectual property (IP) 
              are typically 10%, which might suggest an additional $0.10/kg of 
              IP-related costs on products initially priced at $1/kg, except that 
              user fees might here be calculated according to the level of use 
              (e.g., the number of users or &#8220;seats&#8221; authorized to operate 
              the PN, as is common in commercial software contracts) rather than 
              as a percentage of sales, hence might not be tied to unit price 
              of product like a sales tax would be.</p>
<p>Financing a $4400 capital expenditure on an interest-only basis 
              at a 5% interest rate for a device producing 4400 kg/yr equates 
              to a minimum $0.05/kg financial overhead if the device is always 
              operated at the 50% production rate. The cost of lost opportunity 
              is calculated similarly, with the interest rate taking the role 
              of a discount rate on foregone alternative uses of the capital. 
              Note that the additional amortized capital cost of $0.10/kg still 
              applies because interest-only financing means the borrower still 
              owes the $4400 after 20 years of paying only interest. (These are 
              only crude estimates; an explicit calculation of discounted future 
              value, etc. would be needed to establish more precise estimates.)</p>
<p>Based on the above considerations, an irreducible intangible cost 
              of at least $0.20/kg for government fees, IP rights, and financing 
              costs seems plausible.</p>

              (c) Is the cost of housing really irreducible? It is true that personal 
              residences of current design, if constructed using diamondoid materials, 
              might be buildable using an order of magnitude less processed mass 
              (possibly incorporating water, dirt, or stone ballast to provide 
              wind-resistance bulk) than present-day houses, hence reducing homebuilding 
              costs tenfold assuming a $1/kg rate. However, opposing this deflationary 
              factor will be consumers&#8217; inflationary desire for houses with 
              more square footage and more extensive features&#8212;such as pools 
              and saunas, interior waterfalls and decorative ponds, reconfigurable 
              rooms, escalators and elevators to upper floors, greenhouses and 
              extensive outbuildings for hobby purposes, home theaters, ubiquitous 
              fireplaces and wall-sized &#8220;view&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>, hurricane and 
              earthquake-proofing, and so forth. And it is likely that any remaining 
              savings in house construction costs may be spent to bid up the price 
              of scarce land to build upon in desirable locations, since lower 
              house prices would increase the demand for more houses.</p>

              the cost for the 40.56 kg of liberated gas would be $9.86/kg, not

<p>14. An uncritical optimist heedless of many technical, political, 
              public safety, and other practical obstacles might propose obtaining 
              almost zero-cost energy by employing a single well-shielded 2500 
              micron<sup>3</sup> selenophage of mass ~10<sup>-11</sup> kg that 
              is delivered to the Moon by hitchhiking for free on the next scheduled 
              lunar lander mission that someone launches. The minimum possible 
              energy cost for such a launch approximates the gravitational potential 
              energy of a selenophage resting on Earth&#8217;s surface, or -GM<sub>Earth</sub>m<sub>Selenophage</sub>/R<sub>Earth</sub> 
              ~ 1.7 x 10<sup>-10</sup> kW-hr which would cost ~$1.7 x 10<sup>-11</sup> 
              assuming today&#8217;s energy price on Earth of $0.10/kW-hr. The 
              pure energy cost to manufacture the one selenophage unit in a PN, 
              assuming $1/kg, is also $10<sup>-11</sup>. Using lunar-available 
              visible-spectrum solar energy (25 W/m<sup>2</sup> on cloudless Moon 
              [17]) absorbed on the device&#8217;s surface (184 micron<sup>2</sup>) 
              and local materials, the device replicates copies of itself (at 
              64 MJ/kg, 6.7 x 10-5 J needed per copy; 4.6 nW available to the 
              device via solar energy; assume only 1/6 is used for replication/mechanosynthetic 
              activities) at a leisurely rate of 1 day per copy cycle. Acceleration 
              of each selenophage to the required average diasporic speed of 1.5 
              m/sec across the lunar surface costs (1/2 mv<sup>2</sup> =) 0.01 
              nJ, demanding only 0.002 sec of available onboard power, a negligible 
              drain from replicative activities. After 81.2 doubling times, say 
              82 days, the entire lunar surface is coated with solar-electricity-producing 
              selenophages. Conservatively assuming a solar-electric lifetime 
              of only 10 years before replacement is needed, the circumlunar selenophagic 
              layer now generates a total output of 500 terawatts (current human 
              energy use ~ 10 terawatts worldwide) at a net cost to the original 
              human instigator of (~$10<sup>-11</sup>) / [(500 terawatts) (10 
              years)] ~ $ 2x10<sup>-28</sup> / kW-hr.</p>

<p>17. Taking average ground-level cloudless noontime optical-band 
              solar intensity as 200 W/m<sup>2</sup> [41] and correcting for day/night 
              cycles (0.5), cloud cover (0.5), solar angle (0.5), and 50% conversion 
              efficiency (0.5), the panels deliver ~50 kW/acre (12.5 W/m<sup>2</sup>) 
              or ~4.4 million kW-hr/acre over an assumed 10-year lifetime for 
              the panels. Taking the average cost of vacant rural land as $500/acre 
              [42], the carrying cost at 5% mortgage interest and a 1% property 
              tax rate is $30/yr, or $300/acre for 10 years. Thin diamondoid solar 
              panels with their support structures to cover 1 acre will have a 
              total mass of ~2900 kg [43], costing $2900 if fabricated for $1/kg 
              (see below), bringing total cost over 10 years to $3200/acre and 
              thus the cost of energy to ~$0.001/kW-hr. Cost is similar if the 
              ground is first cleared by a bulldozer at $50-$150/hr [44] plus 
              move-in/out fees, allowing laying solar collectors on the ground 
              without supports. This analysis also ignores any additional costs 
              of local energy storage or transmission to a distant site.</p>
<p>18. Even if the base cost of molecular manufacturing using PNs 
              was lowered to $0.30/kg, food prices would always have less far 
              to fall than durable goods prices because nondurables made using 
              current production <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s such as agriculture start out from a 
              cheaper price base. Agriculture may be regarded as a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>-based 
              nanotechnology (the plant or <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> cells do most of the work of 
              creating the molecular structure of the food, not the farmer) whose 
              prices already have much of the manufacturing cost advantages of 
              nanotechnology built into them.</p>

<p>22. The impact of PNs on the food sector is illustrative. PNs may 
              bring down the prices of basic food and food products 5-fold, with 
              basic nutrition becoming public domain. But food with a strong service 
              component may not suffer and might even thrive. For example, visiting 
              a restaurant is mainly experiential service consumption, not nondurable 
              goods consumption. Served food derives much of its value from ambiance, 
              service, and variety. The restaurant chef may be fabricating all 
              the food using a PN in the back of the kitchen, but the PN will 
              be running specialized software that allows the chef to synthesize 
              each course using unique molecular recipes he&#8217;s written himself 
              incorporating the latest flavors, smells and textures, and to create 
              a dazzling variety of special effects.</p>

<p>28. Keynes [45] had argued in 1936 that public spending was a perfect 
              substitute for private spending in terms of its effect on the overall 
              economy. During the 1940s, the positive impact of WWII on the American 
              economy was interpreted by many as a vindication of Keynesian economic 
              principles, suggesting that it was possible to manage the overall 
              economy through a judicious use of public spending.</p>

<p>32. Ray Kurzweil (personal communication, 21 December 2005) suggests 
              that once a technology becomes an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>, it becomes 
              subject to the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> (LOAR) [46], which is 
              a strongly deflationary force. Some technologies, he says, are already 
              subject to LOAR such as computers and communications, while others 
              are becoming subject to it such as drugs and medical technologies 
              that are in the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing from the hit-and-miss <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              of drug discovery to the information-driven paradigm of rational 
              drug design. Information technology is now only about 10 percent 
              of the economy but will grow substantially over the next 20 years, 
              ultimately dominating the economy. However, Kurzweil adds: &#8220;There 
              is a natural counterbalance to the deflationary effect of the LOAR, 
              which is the tendency to increase consumption with greater <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a>. 
              The price-performance of electronics (in terms of the cost per <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              cycle) has been coming down by half about every year. But our consumption 
              of electronics has more than kept pace: the industry has grown by 
              18% per year in constant dollars over the past fifty years despite 
              the fact that you can buy about twice as much capability each year 
              for the same number of dollars. People didn&#8217;t buy ten thousand 
              dollar iPods ten years ago. We&#8217;ve seen that at each stage of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a>. In the eighteenth century, few people could afford any 
              well-made clothing. With the automation of the textile industry 
              starting around 1800, the common man and woman could afford well-made 
              clothes for the first time, and people were no longer satisfied 
              with owning a single shirt. This led to the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of fashion, 
              in which people did not want to keep wearing the same clothes for 
              very long. So this increase in consumption with increasing price-performance 
              acts as a natural counterbalance so that the deflationary effect 
              of the LOAR does not actually shrink the size of the economy as 
              measured in constant currency.&#8221;</p>
