</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>&#8212;the precise <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of tiny but powerful 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8212;is advancing quickly, leaping from the pages of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              fiction into world-class <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> laboratories, and coming soon 
              to a desktop near you.</p>
<p>Like electricity or <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s before it, nanotechnology will bring 
              greatly improved efficiency and <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> in many areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              endeavor. In its mature form, known as molecular nanotechnology 
              (MNT) or molecular manufacturing (MM), it will have significant 
              impact on almost all industries and all parts of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. Personal 
              nanofactories (PNs) may offer better built, longer lasting, cleaner, 
              safer, and smarter products for the home, for <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, for <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>, for agriculture, and for industry 
              in general.</p>
<p>However, as a general-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, MM will be dual-use, 
              meaning that in addition to its civilian applications, it will have 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> uses as well&#8212;making far more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s and 
              tools of surveillance. Thus, it represents not only wonderful benefits 
              for humanity, but also grave risks.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> toward developing the technical requirements for desktop 
              molecular manufacturing is moving forward rapidly. By reading the 
              collection of essays in the March 27 issue of <i>Nanotechnology 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">Perception</a>s</i>&#8212;or reading them here at KurweilAI.net&#8212;you 
              will learn how PNs will bring radical changes to society, and to 
              your <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>Several factors will come together to make MM truly revolutionary.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cost: One PN can build another PN as easily as any other product, 
                so nanofactories will be neither scarce nor expensive. Labor costs 
                will also be minimal, since PNs will be automated. Small <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s (feedstock) are quite inexpensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Exponential manufacturing: One PN can be made to build two, 
                or a small <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can build one twice as big. Working in parallel, 
                manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> can double every few hours. Within just 
                a few months, a single molecular manipulation <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> could be 
                expanded to PN's with a combined capacity of thousands of tons 
                per hour. The PN <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> can even scale to <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> factories 
                of industrial size.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Precision: Atoms of each type are identical with each other, 
                and products made from precisely placed atoms also will be identical&#8212;more 
                reliable and easier to manufacture.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>High performance: Small machines are more powerful than large 
                ones&#8212;perhaps a million times more powerful, when shrunk to 
                nano-scale&#8212;and precise materials are perhaps 100 times stronger. 
                Also, precise surfaces can have extremely low friction and wear. 
                Nanofactory-built products could include large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of small, 
                high-performance machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>General-purpose manufacturing: <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">Structure</a>s will be made by automated 
                placement of tiny building blocks, so changing the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> (blueprint) 
                will change the product. A wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s and products 
                is possible, including computers, sensors, motors, and displays, 
                and combinations thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid prototyping: Because a nanofactory will make a complete 
                product in a few minutes from any given blueprint, new product 
                designs could be built and tested almost immediately, and at very 
                low cost.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="center">OVERVIEW OF ESSAYS</h3>
<p>In August 2005, the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology (CRN), 
              a non-profit research and advocacy organization, announced the formation 
              of a Task Force convened to study the societal implications of this 
              rapidly emerging technology. Bringing together a diverse group of 
              world-class experts from multiple disciplines, CRN is spearheading 
              an historic, collaborative effort to develop comprehensive recommendations 
              for the safe and responsible use of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Many of the profound implications of molecular manufacturing are 
              explored in an initial collection of 11 new essays, all written 
              by members of the CRN Task Force and published in the March 24 issue 
              of <i>Nanotechnology Perceptions</i>. From military and security 
              issues to human enhancement, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, and more, 
              we take a look under the lid of Pandora's box to see what the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              might hold. A second collection of essays exploring additional concerns 
              will form the next issue of <i>Nanotechnology Perceptions</i>.</p>
<p>Reacting to the huge risks of MM, some advocate that all research 
              be halted. Our first two essays, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0653.html%20" target="_top">Nanotechnology

              Need For Limits</a>," Chris Phoenix explains that we may face unprecedented 
              risks as MM's revolutionary potential dissolves the barriers that 
              keep us safe.</p>
<p>After Giulio Prisco explores the real-world challenge of "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0659.html%20" target="_top">Globalization 
              and Open Source Nano Economy</a>," <a class="thought" href="entries/broderick_entry.html">Damien Broderick</a> provides a broad 
              historical perspective of the relationship between society and technology 
              in "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0660.html%20" target="_top">Cultural 
              Dominants and Differential MNT Uptak</a>e."</p>
<p>Advanced nanotechnology could go well beyond making better consumer 
              goods and better weapons. In "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0661.html%20" target="_top">Nanoethics 
              and Human Enhancement</a>," professional ethicists Patrick Lin and 
              Fritz Allhoff look into the controversial aspects of using MM to 
              change our bodies and minds. Noted <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/vita_more_entry.html">Natasha Vita-More</a> then 
              lays out the problems our grey <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> could face in "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0662.html%20" target="_top">Strategic 
              Sustainable Brain</a>."</p>
<p>Computers built by nanofactories may be millions of times more 
              powerful than anything we have today. The potential for creating 
              world-changing <i>artificial</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is examined by scientist 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hall_entry.html">J. Storrs Hall</a> in "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0655.html%20" target="_top">Is 
              AI Near a Takeoff Point?</a>" Finally, if some of our worst scenarios 
              become real, we may face truly existential dilemmas. These are surveyed 
              in depth by best-selling author David Brin in "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142147/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0656.html%20" target="_top">Singularities

              and informed. But we will be further gratified if you are inspired 
              to learn more. We hope you'll want to get involved in the vital 
              work of raising awareness and finding effective solutions to the 
              challenges presented to the world by advanced nanotechnology.</p>

<br>
<br>
Personally to me MM represents the next stage in our evolutionary journey within the Universe as a species - only in this, next step, we will have, for the 1st time in the history [that we know of] mankind and animal life on this planet, the opportunity to consciously intervene in the evolutionary process.
<br>
<br>
Post Humans are a very real future reality in my mind, and I can well see us as a species entering a very enlightening era, a new age of enlightened awareness you might say.
<br>
<br>
MM offers up so many possibilities for mankind, and it would be a real shame if everyday civilization like me and you, or the man out walking his dog right now in some park, or the scientist reading these articles as I am, let the governments we now live under, [and used to employ - but instead these days they employ themselves more and more] take-over MM and use it solely for militaristic type purposes while continuing to claim that the general public is incapable of realising the every growing threats we are now supposed to face, and as a result we shouldn't be aloud to see such new discoveries let alone utilize them.
<br>
<br>
All excuses to just herd us like cattle in their chosen direction if you ask me, when really it should be US that is telling them what needs to be done, after all we employ them don't we?
<br>
<br>
The Universe is a VAST entity with many other such VAST Entities within it, and MM offers us up the opportunity of seeing it/them, and more importantly understanding it/them at it/their most fundamental levels.
<br>
<br>
At present we Humans are stuck to one planet and are only capable of processing and utilizing vast complex amounts of data via still very bulky machines that we employ to do the most complex of  the analysis of such data for us.
<br>
<br>
With MM we could smash through wall that is holding us back, and design our very bodies and minds to become both self aware Human/person AND analytical machines with improved brain speeds and data storage; no longer relying on bulky machines to do the work for us, but actually doing it in our own minds, and in so doing understanding that "data" with ever more greater depths of awareness.
<br>
<br>
I say bring on the singularity and MM, but lets make it for every man woman and child, and not just for the hawks WE employ to govern OUR societies.
