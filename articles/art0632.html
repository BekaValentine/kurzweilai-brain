<div class="TeaserText">Robert A. Freitas Jr. has filed the first known patent application on positional mechanosynthesis, which is also the first on positional diamond mechanosynthesis. The "Freitas process" -- more fully described here -- is a method for building a tool for molecularly precise fabrication of physical structures. Methods of making diamondoid structures are detailed here, but the same toolbuilding process can be extended to other materials, mechanosynthetic processes, and structures.

              of legal counsel, was abstracted from (and thus differs in some

              material, running a total of 133 pages in length) was subsequently 
              filed on 11 February 2005. This patent is now pending before the 
              USPTO. It is the first known patent ever filed on positional mechanosynthesis, 
              and the first known patent ever filed on positional diamond mechanosynthesis.

<p><a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract. A <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> is described for building 
              a mechanosynthesis tool intended to be used for the molecularly 
              precise fabrication of physical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s&#8211;as for example, 
              diamond structures. The exemplar tool consists of a bulk-synthesized 
              dimer-capped triadamantane tooltip <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> which is initially attached 
              to a deposition surface in tip-down orientation, whereupon CVD or 
              equivalent bulk diamond deposition processes are used to grow a 
              large crystalline handle structure around the tooltip molecule. 
              The large handle with its attached tooltip can then be mechanically 
              separated from the deposition surface, yielding an integral finished 
              tool that can subsequently be used to perform diamond mechanosynthesis 
              in vacuo. The present disclosure is the first description of a complete 
              tool for positional diamond mechanosynthesis, along with its method 
              of manufacture. The same toolbuilding process may be extended to 
              other classes of tooltip molecules, other handle materials, and 
              to mechanosynthetic processes and structures other than those involving 
              diamond.</p>

<p><a name="p1"></a><a name="p1"></a>The properties of diamond, such 
              as its extraordinary hardness, coefficient of friction, tensile

<p><a name="p2"></a><a name="p2"></a>The present invention relates 
              generally to methods for the manufacture of synthetic diamond. More 
              particularly, the invention is concerned with the physical structure 
              and method of manufacture of a tool, which can itself subsequently 
              be employed in the mechanosynthetic manufacture of other molecularly 
              precise diamond structures. However, the same toolbuilding process 
              is readily extended to other classes of tooltip molecules, handle 
              materials, and mechanosynthetic processes and structures other than 
              diamond.</p>
<h5> <a name="1.1"></a>1.1 Conventional Diamond Manufacturing</h5>
<p><a name="p3"></a>All prior <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> methods of manufacturing diamond 
              are bulk processes in which the diamond crystal structure is manufactured 
              by statistical processes. In such processes, new atoms of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> 
              arrive at the growing diamond crystal structure having random positions, 
              energies, and timing. <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">Growth</a> extends outward from initial nucleation 
              centers having uncontrolled size, shape, orientation and location. 
              Existing bulk processes can be divided into three principal methods 
              &#8211; high pressure, low pressure <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>ic, and low pressure 
              nonhydrogenic.</p>
<p> <a name="p4"></a><a name="1.1A"></a>(A) In the <u>first or high 
              pressure bulk method</u> of producing diamond artificially, powders 
              of graphite, diamond, or other carbon-containing substances are 
              subjected to high temperature and high pressure to form crystalline 
              diamond. High pressure processes are of several types [<a href="#R1" target="_self">1</a>]:</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p5"></a>(1) Impact Process. The 
              starting powder is instantaneously brought under high pressure by 
              applying impact generated by, for example, the explosion of explosives 
              and the collision of a body accelerated to a high speed. This produces 
              granular diamond by directly converting the starting powder material 
              having a graphite structure into a powder composed of grains having 
              a diamond structure. This process has the advantage that no press 
              as is required, as in the two other processes, but there is difficulty 
              in controlling the size of the resulting diamond products. Nongraphite 
              organic compounds can also be shock-compressed to produce diamond 
              [<a href="#R2" target="_self">2</a>].</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p6"></a>(2) Direct Conversion 
              Process. The starting powder is held under a high static pressure 
              of 13-16 GPa and a high temperature of 3,000-4,000 oC in a sealed 
              high pressure vessel. This establishes stability conditions for 
              diamond, so the powder material undergoes direct phase transition 
              from graphite into diamond, through graphite decomposition and structural 
              reorganization into diamond. In both direct conversion and flux 
              processes, a press is widely used and enables single crystal diamonds 
              to be grown as large as several millimeters in size.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p7"></a>(3) Flux Process. As 
              in direct conversion, a static pressure and high temperature are 
              applied to the starting material, but here fluxes such as Ni and 
              Fe are added to allow the reaction to occur under lower pressure 
              and temperature conditions, accelerating the atomic rearrangement 
              which occurs during the conversion process. For example, high-purity 
              graphite powder is heated to 1500-2000 oC under 4-6 GPa of pressure 
              in the presence of iron catalyst, and under this extreme, but equilibrium, 
              condition of pressure and temperature, graphite is converted to 
              diamond: The flux becomes a saturated solution of solvated graphite, 
              and because the pressure inside the high pressure vessel is maintained 
              in the stability range for diamond, the solubility for graphite 
              far exceeds that for diamond, leading to diamond precipitation and 
              dissolution of graphite into the flux. Every year about 75 tons 
              of diamond are produced industrially this way [<a href="#R14" target="_self">14</a>].</p>
<p> <a name="p8"></a><a name="1.1B"></a>(B) In the <u>second or low 
              pressure hydrogenic bulk method</u> of producing diamond artificially, 
              widely known as CVD or Chemical Vapor Deposition, hydrogen (H2) 
              gas mixed with a few percent of methane (CH4) is passed over a hot 
              filament or through a microwave discharge, dissociating the methane 
              molecule to form the methyl radical (CH3) and dissociating the hydrogen 
              molecule into atomic hydrogens (H). Acetylene (C2H2) can also be 
              used in a similar manner as a carbon source in CVD. Diamond or diamond-like 
              carbon films can be grown by CVD epitaxially on diamond nuclei, 
              but such films invariably contain small contaminating amounts (0.1-1%) 
              of hydrogen which gives rise to a variety of structural, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              and chemical defects relative to pure bulk diamond. Currently, diamond 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> from CVD is routinely achieved by more than 10 different 
              methods [<a href="#R163" target="_self">163</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p9"></a>As noted by McCune and Baird [<a href="#R3" target="_self">3</a>], 
              a diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> is a special cubic lattice grown from a single 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> of four-coordinated carbon atoms. The diamond-cubic lattice 
              consists of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices, displaced 
              by one quarter of the cube diagonal. Each carbon <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> is tetrahedrally 
              coordinated, making strong, directed sp3 bonds to its neighbors 
              using hybrid atomic orbitals. The lattice can also be visualized 
              as planes of six-membered saturated carbon rings stacked in an ABC 
              ABC ABC sequence along &lt;111&gt; directions. Each ring is in the 
              &#8220;chair&#8221; conformation and all carbon-carbon bonds are 
              staggered. A lattice with hexagonal symmetry, lonsdaleite, can be 
              constructed with the same tetrahedral nearest neighbor <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>. 
              In lonsdaleite, however, the planes of chairs are stacked in an 
              AB AB AB sequence, and the carbon-carbon bonds normal to these planes 
              are eclipsed. In simple organic molecules, the eclipsed conformation 
              is usually less stable than the staggered because steric interactions 
              are greater. Thermodynamically, diamond is slightly unstable with 
              respect to crystalline graphite. At 298 K and 1 atm the free energy 
              difference is 0.026 eV per atom, only slightly greater than kBT, 
              where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature 
              in degrees Kelvin.</p>
<p><a name="p10"></a>The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> obstacle to crystallization of diamond 
              at low pressures is the difficulty in avoiding co-deposition of 
              graphite and/or amorphous carbon when operating in the thermodynamically 
              stable region of graphite [<a href="#R3" target="_self">3</a>]. 
              In general, the possibility of forming different bonding <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s 
              of carbon atoms is understandable from their ability to form different 
              electronic configurations of the valence electrons. These bond types 
              are classified as sp3 (tetrahedral), sp2 (planar), and sp1 (<a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>), 
              and are related to the various carbon allotropes including cubic 
              diamond and hexagonal diamond or lonsdaleite (sp3), graphite (sp2), 
              and carbenes (sp1), respectively.</p>
<p><a name="p11"></a>Hydrogen is generally regarded as an essential 
              part of the reaction steps in forming diamond film during CVD, and 
              atomic hydrogen must be present during low pressure diamond growth 
              to: (1) stabilize the diamond surface, (2) reduce the size of the 
              critical nucleus, (3) &#8220;dissolve&#8221; the carbon in the feedstock 
              gas, (4) produce carbon solubility minimum, (5) generate condensable 
              carbon radicals in the feedstock gas, (6) abstract hydrogen from 
              hydrocarbons attached to the surface, (7) produce vacant surface 
              sites, (8) etch (regasify) graphite, hence suppressing unwanted 
              graphite formation, and (9) terminate carbon dangling bonds [<a href="#R4" target="_self">4</a>, 
              <a href="#R6" target="_self">6</a>]. Both diamond and graphite are 
              etched by atomic hydrogen, but for diamond, the deposition rate 
              exceeds the etch rate during CVD, leading to diamond (tetrahedral 
              sp3 bonding) growth and the suppression of graphite (planar sp2 
              bonding) formation. (Note that most potential atomic hydrogen substitutes 
              such as atomic halogens etch graphite at much higher rates than 
              atomic hydrogen [<a href="#R4" target="_self">4</a>].)</p>
<p><a name="p12"></a>Low pressure or CVD hydrogenic metastable diamond 
              growth processes are of several types [<a href="#R3" target="_self">3</a>-<a href="#R5" target="_self">5</a>]:</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p13"></a>(1) Hot Filament Chemical 
              Vapor Deposition (HFCVD). Filament deposition involves the use of 
              a dilute (0.1-2.5%) mixture of hydrocarbon gas (typically methane) 
              and hydrogen gas (H2) at 50-1000 torr which is introduced via a 
              quartz tube located just above a hot tungsten filament or foil which 
              is electrically heated to a temperature ranging from 1750-2800 oC. 
              The gas mixture dissociates at the filament surface, yielding dissociation 
              products consisting mainly of radicals including CH3, CH2, C2H, 
              and CH, acetylene, and atomic hydrogen, as well as unreacted CH4 
              and H2. A heated deposition <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> placed just below the hot 
              tungsten filament is held in a resistance heated boat (often molybdenum) 
              and maintained at a temperature of 500-1100 oC, whereupon diamonds 
              are condensed onto the heated substrate. Filaments of W, Ta, and 
              Mo have been used to produce diamond. The filament is typically 
              placed within 1 cm of the substrate surface to minimize thermalization 
              and radical recombination, but radiation heating can produce excessive 
              substrate temperatures leading to nonuniformity and even graphitic 
              deposits. Withdrawing the filament slightly and biasing it negatively 
              to pass an electron current to the substrate assists in preventing 
              excessive radiation heating.</p>

              Chemical Vapor Deposition (PACVD). Plasma deposition involves the 
              addition of a plasma discharge to the foregoing filament process. 
              The plasma discharge increases the nucleation density and growth 
              rate, and is believed to enhance diamond film formation as opposed 
              to discrete diamond particles. There are three basic plasma <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              in common use: a microwave plasma system, a radio frequency or RF 
              (inductively or capacitively coupled) plasma system, and a direct 
              current or DC plasma system. The RF and microwave plasma systems 
              use relatively complex and expensive equipment which usually requires 
              complex tuning or matching networks to electrically couple electrical 
              energy to the generated plasma. The diamond growth rate offered 
              by these two systems can be quite modest, on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of ~1 micron/hour. 
              Diamonds can also be grown in microwave discharges in a magnetic 
              field, under conditions where electron cyclotron resonance is considerably 
              modified by collisions. These &#8220;magneto-microwave&#8221; plasmas 
              can have significantly higher densities and electron energies than 
              isotropic plasmas and can be used to deposit diamond over large 
              areas. </p>

              Chemical Vapor Deposition. Flame deposition of diamond occurs via 
              direct deposit from acetylene as a hydrocarbon-rich oxyacetylene 
              flame. In this technique, conducted at atmospheric pressure, a specific 
              part of the flame (in which both atomic hydrogen (H) and carbon 
              dimers (C2) are present [<a href="#R19">19</a>]) is played on a 
              substrate on which diamond grows at rates as high as &gt;100 microns/hour

              (e.g., C60) vapor suspended in a noble gas stream or a vapor of 
              mixed fullerenes (e.g., C60, C70) is passed into a microwave chamber, 
              forming a plasma in the chamber and breaking down the fullerenes 
              into smaller fragments including isolated carbon dimer radicals 
              (C2) [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. (Often a small amount of H2, e.g., ~1%,

              [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon, containing 
              no hydrogen, so diamonds produced from fullerene precursors are 
              hydrogen-defect free [<a href="#R11">11</a>] &#8211; indeed, the

              single crystal diamond sample [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. The growth 
              rate of diamond film is ~1.2 microns/hour, comparable to the deposition

              deposition conditions [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. 
              Diamond films can, using this process, be grown at relatively low 
              temperatures (&lt;500 oC) [<a href="#R10">10</a>] as opposed to

<p><a name="p17"></a><i>Ab initio</i> calculations indicate that C2 
              insertion into carbon-hydrogen bonds is energetically favorable 
              with small activation barriers, and that C2 insertion into carbon-carbon 
              bonds is also energetically favorable with low activation barriers 
              [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. A mechanism for growth on the diamond C(100) 
              (2x1):H reconstructed surface with C2 has been proposed [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. 
              A C2 molecule impinges on the surface and inserts into a surface 
              carbon-carbon dimer bond, after which the C2 then inserts into an 
              adjacent carbon-carbon bond to form a new surface carbon dimer. 
              By the same process, a second C2 molecule forms a new surface dimer 
              on an adjacent row. Then a third C2 molecule inserts into the trough 
              between the two new surface dimers, so that the three C2 molecules 
              incorporated into the diamond surface form a new surface dimer row 
              running perpendicular to the previous dimer row. This C2 growth 
              mechanism requires no hydrogen <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> reactions from the surface 
              and in principle should proceed in the absence of gas phase atomic 
              hydrogen.</p>
<p><a name="p18"></a>The UNCD films were grown on silicon (Si) substrates 
              polished with 100 nm diamond grit particles to enhance nucleation 
              [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. Deposition of UNCD on a sacrificial release 
              layer of SiO2 substrate is very difficult because the nucleation 
              density is 6 orders of magnitude smaller on SiO2 than on Si [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. 
              However, the carbon dimer growth <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in the UNCD process can 
              insert directly into either the Si or SiO2 surface, and the lack 
              of atomic hydrogen in the UNCD fabrication process permits both 
              a higher nucleation density and a higher renucleation rate than 
              the conventional H2/CH4 plasma <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> [<a href="#R18">18</a>], 
              so it is therefore possible to grow UNCD directly on SiO2.</p>
<p><a name="p19"></a>Besides fullerenes, it has been proposed that 
              &#8220;diamondoids&#8221; or polymantanes, small hydrocarbons made 
              of one or more fused cages of adamantane (C10H16, the smallest unit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> of hydrogen-terminated crystalline diamond) could be used as 
              the carbon source in nonhydrogenic diamond CVD [<a href="#R20">20</a>-<a href="#R22">22</a>]. 
              Dahl, Carlson and Liu [<a href="#R22">22</a>] suggest that the injection 
              of diamondoids could facilitate growth of CVD-grown diamond film 
              by allowing carbon atoms to be deposited at a rate of about 10-100 
              or more at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, unlike conventional plasma CVD in which carbons 
              are added to the growing film one atom at a time, possibly increasing 
              diamond growth rates by an order of magnitude or better. However, 
              Plaisted and Sinnott [<a href="#R23">23</a>] used atomistic simulations 
              to study thin-film growth via the deposition of very hot (119-204 
              eV/molecule; 13-17 km/sec) beams of adamantane molecules on hydrogen-terminated 
              diamond (111) surfaces, with forces on the atoms in the simulations 
              calculated using a many-body reactive empirical potential for hydrocarbons. 
              During the deposition process the adamantane molecules react with 
              one another and the surface to form hydrocarbon thin films that 
              are primarily polymeric with the amount of adhesion depending strongly 
              on incident energy. Despite the fact that the carbon atoms in the 
              adamantane molecules are fully sp3 hybridized, the films contain 
              primarily sp2 hybridized carbon with the percentage of sp2 hybridization 
              increasing as the incident velocity goes up. However, cooler beams 
              might allow more consistent sp3 diamond deposition, and other techniques 
              [<a href="#R24">24</a>] have deposited diamond-like carbon (DLC) 
              films with a higher percentage of sp3 hybridization from adamantane.</p>
<h5> <a name="1.2"></a>1.2 Diamond Manufacturing via Positional Diamond 
              Mechanosynthesis</h5>
<p><a name="p20"></a>A new non-bulk non-statistical method of manufacturing 
              diamond, called positional diamond mechanosynthesis, was proposed 
              theoretically by Drexler in 1992 [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. In this 
              method, positionally controlled carbon deposition tools are manipulated 
              to sub-<a class="thought" href="entries/angstrom_entry.html">Angstrom</a> tolerances via SPM (Scanning Probe Microscopy) or 
              similar atomic-resolution manipulator mechanisms to build diamond 
              in vacuo. Each carbon deposition tool includes a tooltip molecule 
              attached to a larger handle structure which is grasped by the atomic-resolution 
              manipulator mechanism. One or more carbon atoms having one or more 
              dangling bonds are relatively loosely bound to the tip of the tooltip 
              molecule. When the tip is brought into contact with the substrate 
              surface at a specific location and sufficient mechanical forces 
              (compression, torsion, etc.) are applied, a stronger <a class="thought" href="entries/covalent_bond_entry.html">covalent bond</a> 
              is formed between the tip-bound carbon atom(s) and the surface, 
              via the dangling bonds, than previously existed between the tip-bound 
              carbon atom(s) and the tooltip structure. As a result, the tool 
              may subsequently be retracted from the substrate and the tip-bound 
              carbon atom(s) will be left behind on the substrate surface at the 
              specific location and orientation desired. By repeating this process 
              of positionally-constrained chemistry or mechanosynthesis, using 
              a succession of similar tools, a large variety of molecularly precise 
              diamond structures can be fabricated, placing one or a few atoms 
              at a time on the growing workpiece.</p>
<p><a name="p21"></a>Several analyses using the increasingly accurate 
              methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al chemistry have confirmed the theoretical 
              validity of the proposed process of positional diamond mechanosynthesis 
              for hydrogen abstraction [<a href="#R25">25</a>-<a href="#R33">33</a>] 
              and hydrogen donation [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>], 
              in respect to the surface passivating hydrogen atoms, and carbon 
              deposition [<a href="#R32">32</a>-<a href="#R38">38</a>], in respect 
              to diamond surfaces and the body of diamond nanostructures. While 
              positional diamond mechanosynthesis has not yet been demonstrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ally, early experiments [<a href="#R39">39</a>] have demonstrated 
              single-molecule positional covalent bond formation on surfaces via 
              SPM, though in these cases bond formation was not purely mechanochemical 
              but included electrochemical or other means. Mechanosynthesis of 
              the Si(111) lattice has been studied theoretically [<a href="#R40">40</a>, 
              <a href="#R41">41</a>] and the first laboratory demonstration of 
              nonelectrical, purely mechanical positional covalent bond formation 
              on a silicon surface using a simple SPM tip was reported in 2003 
              [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. In this demonstration, Osaka University 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers lowered a silicon AFM tip toward the silicon Si(111)-(7x7) 
              surface and pushed down on a single atom. The focused pressure forced 
              the atom free of its bonds to neighboring atoms, which allowed it 
              to bind to the AFM tip. After lifting the tip and imaging the material, 
              there was a hole where the atom had been (<a href="#Figure1">Figure 
              1</a>). Pressing the tip back into the vacancy redeposited the tip-bound 
              selected single atom, this time using the pressure to break the 
              bond with the tip. These manipulation processes were purely mechanical 
              since neither bias voltage nor voltage pulse was applied between 
              probe and sample [<a href="#R42">42</a>].</p>

<h2> <a name="2"></a>2. Description of the Invention</h2>
<p><a name="p26"></a>The present invention is concerned with the physical 
              structure and method of manufacture of a complete tool for positional 
              diamond mechanosynthesis, which can subsequently be employed in 
              the mechanosynthetic manufacture of other molecularly precise diamond 
              structures, including other tools for positional diamond mechanosynthesis.</p>
<p><a name="p27"></a>The present invention is the first description 
              of a complete tool for positional diamond mechanosynthesis, along 
              with its method of manufacture. The subject mechanosynthetic tool 
              is constructed using only bulk chemical and mechanical processes, 
              and yet, once fabricated, is capable of molecularly precise carbon 
              dimer deposition to produce molecularly precise diamond structures. 
              The present invention provides a tool by which the trajectory and 
              timing of each new carbon atom added to a growing diamond nanostructure 
              can be precisely controlled, thus allowing the manufacture of molecularly 
              precise three-dimensional diamond structures of specified size, 
              shape, orientation, location, and chemical composition, a significant 
              improvement over all known bulk methods for fabricating synthetic 
              diamond and a significant improvement over all existing mechanosynthetic 
              SPM tips or styluses.</p>
<p><a name="p28"></a>The positional diamond mechanosynthesis tool 
              described herein enables the convenient manufacture of large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s 
              and varieties of diamond mechanosynthesis tools of similar or improved 
              types, and also enables the convenient manufacture of a wide variety 
              of molecularly precise nanoscale, microscale, and other diamond 
              structures that cannot be fabricated by any known bulk process, 
              including, but not limited to, molecularly-sharp scanning probe 
              tips, shaped nanopores and custom binding sites, complex nanosensors, 
              interleaved nanomechanical structures, compact mechanical nanocomputer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, nanoelectronic and quantum computational <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, aperiodically 
              nanostructured optical materials, and many other complex nanodevices, 
              nanomachines, and nanorobots. The tool can also be used in the fabrication 
              of additional tools for the positional mechanosynthetic manufacture 
              of molecularly precise structures made of materials other than diamond, 
              employing either carbon (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> and other graphene sheet 
              structures) or carbon together with <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s other than carbon, 
              such as nanostructured nondiamond hydrocarbons, nanostructured fluorocarbons, 
              nanostructured sapphire/alumina, and even <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and other organic 
              polymeric materials.</p>
<p><a name="p29"></a>The positional diamond mechanosynthesis tool 
              consists of two distinct parts which are covalently joined.</p>
<p><a name="p30"></a>The first part of the positional diamond mechanosynthesis 
              tool is the tooltip molecule (<a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>). 
              In the preferred embodiment the tooltip molecule consists of one 
              or more adamantane molecules arranged in a polymantane or lonsdaleite 
              (iceane; <a href="#Figure2C">Figure 2C</a>) configuration making 
              a triadamantane base molecule. One or more dimerholder atoms (most 
              preferably the Group IV elements Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb with three bonds 
              into the base, but Group V elements N, P, As, Sb and Bi and Group 
              III elements B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl with two bonds into the base 
              may also be used [<a href="#R36">36</a>]) are substituted into each 
              of the adamantane molecules composing the triadamantane base molecule. 
              A single carbon dimer (C2) molecule is bonded to two dimerholder 
              atoms integral to the triadamantane base molecule; the carbon dimer 
              is held by the tooltip but is later mechanically released during 
              a mechanosynthetic dimer placement operation. Finally, a capping 
              group is temporarily bonded to the two dangling bonds of the carbon 
              dimer, passivating the dangling bonds and chemically stabilizing 
              the tooltip molecule for a solution-phase environment. The capping 
              group must be removed from the tooltip, exposing the dimer dangling 
              bonds and activating the tooltip molecule, prior to use in a diamond 
              mechanosynthesis operation.</p>
<p><a name="p31"></a>The second part of the positional diamond mechanosynthesis 
              tool is the handle structure (e.g., <a href="#Figure17">Figure 17</a>). 
              The handle structure may be a large rigid molecule, consisting in 
              the preferred embodiment of a regular crystal, or a rod, or a cone, 
              of pure hydrogen-terminated diamond, thus providing the greatest 
              possible mechanical rigidity and thermal stability. At the base 
              of the handle, the handle structure is sufficiently wide (0.1-10 
              microns in diameter) to be securely grasped by, or bonded to, a 
              conventional SPM tip, a <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> robotic end-effector, or other similarly 
              rigid and well-controlled microscale manipulator device. Near the 
              apex of the handle structure, the tooltip molecule is covalently 
              bonded to the handle structure, forming an intimate and permanent 
              connection thereto. The tooltip molecule is oriented <a class="thought" href="entries/coaxial_entry.html">coaxial</a>ly with 
              the handle structure, with the carbon dimer (whether capped or uncapped) 
              of the tooltip molecule occupying the location most distal from 
              the base of the handle structure, just as the writing tip of a sharpened 
              pencil is most distal from the pencil eraser end.</p>
<p><a name="p32"></a>The manufacture of the complete positional diamond 
              mechanosynthesis tool requires four distinct steps, including (1) 
              synthesis of capped tooltip molecule (<a href="#2.1">Section 2.1</a>), 
              (2) attachment of tooltip molecule to deposition surface in a preferred 
              orientation (<a href="#2.2">Section 2.2</a>), (3) attaching handle 
              structures onto the tooltip molecules (<a href="#2.3">Section 2.3</a>), 
              and finally (4) separating the finished tools from the deposition 
              surface (<a href="#2.4">Section 2.4</a>). The concept of seeded 
              growth of a useful nanoscale tool has previously been employed in 
              the CVD growth of carbon nanotube tips for AFM [<a href="#R50">50</a>-<a href="#R52">52</a>].</p>
<h5> <a name="2.1"></a><a name="Step1"></a>2.1 STEP 1: Synthesis of 
              Capped Tooltip Molecule</h5>
<p><u><a name="p33"></a><a href="#Step1">STEP 1</a></u>. <b>Synthesize 
              the triadamantane tooltip molecule, with its active C2 dimer tip 
              appropriately capped</b>, using methods of bulk chemical synthesis 
              derived from known synthesis pathways for functionalized polyadamantanes 
              as found in the existing chemical literature.</p>
<p><a name="p34"></a>While an explicit synthesis of the exact DCB6-X 
              (X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) capped tooltip molecule has not yet been located 
              in the chemical literature, the sila-adamantanes have been investigated 
              since at least the early 1970s [<a href="#R53">53</a>-<a href="#R55">55</a>] 
              and multiply-substituted adamantanes such as 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-tetrasilaadamantane 
              [<a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>] and other 1,3,5,7-tetrasilaadamantanes 
              [<a href="#R57">57</a>] have been synthesized. Adamantanes are readily 
              functionalized with alkene C=C bonds, e.g., 2,2-divinyladamantane, 
              a colorless liquid at room temperature [<a href="#R161">161</a>]. 
              Polymantanes as a class of molecules can be functionalized [<a href="#R58">58</a>, 
              <a href="#R60">60</a>] and assembled to a limited extent, including 
              biadamantanes [<a href="#R66">63</a>], diadamantanes [<a href="#R64">64</a>-<a href="#R66">66</a>] 
              and diamantanes [<a href="#R67">67</a>], triamantanes [<a href="#R68">68</a>, 
              <a href="#R69">69</a>], and tetramantanes [<a href="#R70">70</a>, 
              <a href="#R71">71</a>]. The Beilstein <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> lists over 20,000 
              adamantane variants and there are several excellent literature reviews 
              of adamantane chemistry [<a href="#R59">59</a>-<a href="#R63">63</a>]. 
              The molecular geometries of diamantane, triamantane, and isotetramantane 
              have been investigated theoretically using molecular mechanics, 
              semiempirical and ab initio approaches [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. 
              The core of the DCB6-X (X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) class of adamantane-based 
              tooltip molecules is a single iceane molecule (<a href="#Figure2C">Figure 
              2C</a>), the smallest unit cage of lonsdaleite or hexagonal diamond 
              (the counterpart to adamantane which is the unit cage for the more 
              common cubic diamond lattice). The iceane molecule was first synthesized 
              experimentally in 1974 [<a href="#R73">73</a>-<a href="#R75">75</a>] 
              and more recently has been studied using the customary methods of 
              computational chemistry [<a href="#R77">77</a>-<a href="#R80">80</a>]; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> sources for hexagonal diamond (lonsdaleite) powder already 
              exist [<a href="#R76">76</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p35"></a>A crucial decision to be made in a particular 
              application of this invention is the choice of capping group to 
              be used to passivate the two dangling bonds of the C2 dimer that 
              is held by the tooltip molecule. The presence of the capping group 
              converts the otherwise highly reactive C2 dimer radical into a chemically 
              stable moiety in solution phase for the duration of the synthesis 
              process. Only when the capping group is later removed (<a href="#2.2">Section 
              2.2</a>), in vacuo, does the C2 dimer resume its status as a chemically 
              active radical. Note that for some choices of capping group it may 
              be simpler to synthesize the capped tooltip molecule in the configuration 
              of a double-capped single-bonded C-C dimer, then employ a subsequent 
              process to alkenate the dimer bond to C=C which would include removing 
              half of the capping groups.</p>
<p><a name="p36"></a>Many possible capping groups could in principle 
              provide electronic closed-shell termination of the C2 dangling bonds, 
              thus maximizing tooltip molecule chemical stability during conventional 
              solution synthesis in <a href="#Step1">Step 1</a> and during tooltip 
              molecule attachment in <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a> (<a href="#2.2">Section 
              2.2</a>). In some procedures, attachment is facilitated if the chemical 
              structure of the capping group is highly dissimilar to the adamantane 
              structure of the tooltip molecule, so that the capping group may 
              be conveniently removed, e.g., by selective bond resonance excitation, 
              during the tooltip attachment process. (Thus purely hydrocarbon-based 
              and some other organic radicals may be problematic as capping groups.) 
              For simplicity of analysis, ease of tooltip molecule synthesis, 
              and ease of capping group removal, the capping group should have 
              as few atoms as possible, all else equal. An enumeration of 400 
              potentially useful capping groups fulfilling the above requirements 
              is given in <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>, though the present invention 
              is not limited to this partial list of illustrative exemplar moieties. 
              As the number of atoms in the capping group increases, the combinatoric 
              possibilities expand enormously. Some of the groups listed in <a href="#Table1">Table 
              1</a> may yield tooltip molecules that are stable only at very low 
              temperatures or only in particular chemical environments, and a 
              few may not yet have been verified as experimentally available or 
              even chemically stable.</p>

<p><a name="p37"></a>The precise choice of capping group is determined 
              by the desired interactions of tooltip molecules with the selected 
              deposition surface (as described in <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a> 
              (<a href="#2.2">Section 2.2</a>) and <a href="#Step4">Step 4</a> 
              (<a href="#2.4">Section 2.4</a>)), but also by the desired interactions 
              of tooltip molecules with themselves, e.g., during synthesis. There 
              are at least four relevant factors which must be considered.</p>
<p><u><a name="p38"></a>First</u>, from the standpoint of basic utility 
              the ideal capping group: (1) should be loosely bound to the dimer, 
              thus easily released in order to uncap (and activate) the tooltip; 
              (2) should form only a single bond with carbon; and (3) should be 
              very simple, hence relatively easy to synthesize in a polymantane 
              system. A few capping atoms that meet these criteria are given in

<p><a name="p39"></a>For ease of release alone, <a href="#Table2">Table

              as the C2 dimer capping group of the tooltip molecule, as shown 
              in <a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> below, right, though other capping

<p align="center">(B)) capped with iodine atoms</p>
<p><u><a name="p40"></a>Second</u>, during bulk chemical synthesis 
              using conventional techniques in solution phase, the capped tooltip 
              molecule should not spontaneously dimerize across the C2 working 
              tips. Dimerization can occur between two tooltip molecules across 
              one bond or two bonds, as shown in <a href="#Figure4">Figure 4</a>. 
              <a href="#Table3">Table 3</a> shows the results of <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> optimization 
              energy minimization calculations using semi-empirical AM1 for the 
              DCB6-Ge capped tooltip molecule [<a href="#R235">235</a>] in various 
              stages of &#8220;tip-on-tip&#8221; dimerization, for a variety of 
              capping groups, in vacuo.</p>
<p><a name="p41"></a>With no protective capping group in place, tip-to-tip 
              dimerization is very energetically favorable. Tooltip molecule dimerization 
              is energetically unfavorable to varying degrees for 1-atom capping 
              groups consisting of, for example, -I, -Cl, -F, -Na, and -Li, and 
              also for several 2-atom capping groups including hydroxyl (-OH), 
              amine (-NH2), oxylithyl (-OLi), oxyiodinyl (-OI), and sulfiodinyl 
              (-SI). In the case of some 2-atom oxyl (-OF), sulfyl (-SS-, -SH, 
              -SF), and selenyl (-SeH) capping groups, dimerization is energetically 
              unfavorable for direct =C-C= bonds linking the two tooltip molecules 
              but appears likely to occur if dimerization occurs through an oxygen, 
              sulfur (e.g., =C-S-C= or =C-S-S-C=) or selenium atom in the dimerization 
              bond(s) linking the two tooltip molecules. Single-bond dimerization 
              of an H-capped tooltip molecule with release of H2 is also energetically 
              favorable, though double-bond dimerization for H-capped tooltips 
              with the release of 2H2 appears unfavorable.</p>
<p><a name="p42"></a>These analyses should be repeated using ab initio 
              techniques, and should be extended to include a calculation of activation 
              energy barriers (which could be substantial), weak ionic forces 
              that could lead to crystallization (in the case of capping groups 
              containing metal or semi-metal atoms), and solvent effects, all 
              of which could affect the results. As a limited example of one such 
              study, Mann et al [<a href="#R38">38</a>] found that the dimerization 
              reaction enthalpies of uncapped DCB6-Si and DCB6-Ge tooltip molecules 
              are -1.64 eV and -1.84 eV, but that the energy barriers to the dimerization 
              reaction were 1.93 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively. Therefore the dimerization 
              of uncapped DCB6-Si and DCB6-Ge tooltip molecules &#8220;is thermodynamically 
              favored but not kinetically favored. Due to the electron correlation 
              errors in DFT these barrier heights may be considerably overestimated, 
              therefore both reactions may be kinetically <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible at room temperature.&#8221; 
              Subsequent work [<a href="#R235">235</a>] appears to have confirmed 
              that both tooltips work well as expected on the diamond C(110) surface, 
              with the DCB6-Ge structure emerging as the preferred dimer placement 
              tooltip molecule [<a href="#R235">235</a>].</p>

<p><a name="p43"></a>In the case of bromine, and to a lesser extent 
              in several other cases, the undimerized and 1-bond dimerized forms 
              appear energetically almost equivalent, although 2-bond dimerization 
              is energetically unlikely. Application of the process described 
              in <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a> using a capping group having this 
              characteristic could result in a mixture of undimerized and 1-bond 
              dimerized tooltips attached to the deposition surface. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> 
              that some 1-bond dimerizations occur and that a few dimerized tooltip 
              molecules are subsequently inserted into the deposition surface 
              during <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a>, the distinctive two-lobed geometric 
              signature of these dimerized nucleation seeds can be detected and 
              mapped via SPM scan prior to <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>, and subsequently 
              avoided during tool detachment in <a href="#Step4">Step 4</a>. Surface 
              editing is another approach. Due to the low surface nucleation density 
              (<a href="#2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a>), after the aforementioned mapping 
              procedure it may be possible to selectively detach and remove from 
              the surface all attached dimerized tooltip molecules that are detected, 
              e.g., using focused ion beam, electron beam, or NSOM photoionization, 
              subtractively editing the deposition surface prior to commencing 
              CVD in <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>. An alternative to subtractive 
              editing is additive editing, wherein FIB deposition of new substrate 
              atoms on and around the dimerized tooltip molecule can effectively 
              bury it under a smooth mound of fresh substrate, again preventing 
              nucleation of diamond at that site during <a href="#Step3">Step 
              3</a>.</p>
<p><u><a name="p44"></a>Third</u>, the capped-C2 tip of the capped 
              tooltip molecule should not spontaneously recombine into the side 
              or the bottom of the adamantane base of neighboring tooltip molecules, 
              during synthesis or storage, as illustrated in <a href="#Figure5">Figure 
              5</a> for a side-bonding event. Recombination can occur between 
              two tooltip molecules across one bond or two bonds. <a href="#Table4">Table 
              4</a> shows the results of semi-empirical energy calculations using 
              AM1 for the DCB6-Ge capped tooltip molecule in two particular cases 
              of &#8220;tip-on-base&#8221; side-bonding recombination, for a variety 
              of capping groups, in vacuo.</p>
<p><a name="p45"></a>With no protective capping group, tip-on-base 
              recombination is very energetically preferred, with 1-bond recombination 
              preferred over 2-bond when the H atom released from the adamantane 
              base during formation of the 1-bond link becomes bonded with the 
              remaining dangling bond of the tip-held C2 dimer. Mann et al [<a href="#R38">38</a>] 
              showed that intermolecular dehydrogenation from the bottom of the 
              adamantane base by a neighboring uncapped tooltip molecule is exothermic 
              and kinetically accessible (against a 0.48 eV reaction energy barrier) 
              at room temperature. However, with an appropriate cap in place, 
              tooltip molecule recombination is energetically unfavorable to varying 
              degrees, e.g., for 1-atom capping groups consisting of -I, -Br, 
              -Na, and -Li, and also for several 2-atom capping groups including 
              hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH2), oxylithyl (-OLi), seleniodinyl (-SeI), 
              several sulfyl groups including sulfhydryl (-SH), sulfiodinyl (-SI), 
              and sulfalithyl (-SLi), and dimagnesyl (-MgMg-). There may be some 
              tip-to-tip ionic bonding for beryllium (-Be-), lithium, oxylithyl, 
              seleniodinyl, selenobromyl (-SeBr), berylfluoryl (-BeF) and berylchloryl 
              (-BeCl) capping groups, and the imide (-NH-) cap appears to twist 
              the tooltip dimer out of horizontal alignment. In the case of some 
              2-atom sulfyl (-SF, -SBr), and selenyl (-SeH) capping groups, recombination 
              is energetically unfavorable for direct =C-C= bonds linking the 
              two tooltip molecules but appears likely to occur if recombination 
              occurs through a sulfur (e.g., =C-S-C= or =C-S-S-C=) or selenium 
              atom in the recombination bond(s) linking the two tooltip molecules. 
              Single-bond recombination of an H-capped tooltip molecule with release 
              of H2 is slightly energetically favorable, though double-bond dimerization 
              for H-capped tooltips with release of 2H2 appears very unfavorable 
              energetically. These analyses should be repeated using ab initio 
              techniques, and should be extended to include a calculation of activation 
              energy barriers (which could be substantial), weak ionic forces 
              that could lead to crystallization (in the case of capping groups 
              containing metal atoms), and solvent effects, all of which could 
              affect the results.</p>

<p><a name="p46"></a>In the case of chlorine, and to a lesser extent 
              in several other cases, the unrecombined and 1-bond recombined forms 
              appear energetically almost equivalent, although 2-bond recombination 
              is energetically unlikely. Application of the process described 
              in <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a> using a capping group having this 
              characteristic could result in a mixture of unrecombined and 1-bond 
              recombined tooltips attached to the deposition surface. In the event 
              that some 1-bond recombinations occur and that a few recombined 
              tooltip molecules are subsequently inserted into the deposition 
              surface during <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a>, the distinctive two-lobed 
              geometric signature of these recombined nucleation seeds can be 
              detected and mapped via SPM scan prior to <a href="#Step3">Step 
              3</a>, and subsequently avoided during tool detachment in <a href="#Step4">Step 
              4</a>. Surface editing is another approach. Due to the low surface 
              nucleation density (<a href="#2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a>), after the 
              aforementioned mapping procedure it may be possible to selectively 
              detach and remove from the surface all attached recombined tooltip 
              molecules that are detected, e.g., using focused ion beam, electron 
              beam, or NSOM photoionization, subtractively editing the deposition 
              surface prior to commencing CVD in <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>. 
              An alternative to subtractive editing is additive editing, wherein 
              FIB deposition of new substrate atoms on and around the recombined 
              tooltip molecule can effectively bury it under a smooth mound of 
              fresh substrate, again preventing nucleation of diamond at that 
              site during <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>.</p>
<p><u><a name="p47"></a>Fourth</u>, the capped-C2 tip of the capped 
              tooltip molecule should not spontaneously react with solvent, feedstock, 
              or catalyst molecules that are employed during conventional techniques 
              for the bulk chemical synthesis of functionalized adamantanes in 
              solution phase. A definitive result regarding this capping-group 
              selection factor depends critically upon the exact synthesis pathways 
              required.</p>
<p><a name="p48"></a>As a proxy for these many pathways, it has been 
              shown that even straight-chain hydrocarbons, upon exposure to the 
              customary aluminum halide catalysts at high temperature, readily 
              produce mixtures of various polymethyladamantanes [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. 
              The simplest-case recombination event illustrated in <a href="#Figure6">Figure 
              6</a> was analyzed via semi-empirical energy calculations using 
              AM1 for the DCB6-Ge iodine-capped tooltip molecule in the specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of 1-bond and 2-bond side-bonding recombination with a 
              simple straight-chain hydrocarbon molecule (n-octane). The 2-bond 
              analysis includes one event in which the second bond occurs adjacent 
              to the first, producing a 4-carbon ring with the octane molecule, 
              and a second alternative event in which the second bond occurs with 
              an octane chain carbon atom three positions down the chain, producing 
              a more stable 6-carbon ring with the octane molecule. Since solvent 
              effects, temperature, reverse reaction rates, and so forth will 
              determine whether the reaction can occur, and will also determine 
              the relative yields of various products and reactants, the thermodynamics 
              results indicate primarily the relative ease or difficulty of maintaining 
              the given capped tooltip molecule stably in solution with liquid 
              n-octane. The <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in <a href="#Table5">Table 5</a> show that iodine 
              (-I), hydrogen (-H), amine (-NH2), and perhaps bromine (-Br) capped 
              tooltip molecules should be the most stable in hydrocarbon <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, 
              as should seleniodinyl (-SeI) and several sulfyl-capped molecules 
              including sulfhydryl (-SH), sulfiodinyl (-SI), and sulfobromyl (-SBr). 
              Fluorine- and oxygen-containing capping groups may be (relatively) 
              less stable.</p>

<p><u><a name="p49"></a><a href="#Step2">STEP 2</a></u>. <b>Attach 
              a small number of tooltip molecules to an appropriate deposition 
              surface in tip-down orientation, so that the tooltip-bound dimer 
              is bonded to the deposition surface.</b></p>
<p><a name="p50"></a>The appropriate deposition surface material (<a href="#2.2.1">Section 
              2.2.1</a>) is determined by choosing a surface which is not readily 
              amenable to bulk diamond deposition, under the thermal and chemical 
              conditions that will prevail during the diamond deposition processes 
              described in <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>. In Attachment Method A 
              (<a href="#2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</a>), tooltip molecules may be bonded 
              to the deposition surface in the desired orientation via low-energy 
              ion bombardment of the deposition surface in vacuo, creating a low 
              density of preferred diamond nucleation sites. In Attachment Method 
              B (<a href="#2.2.3">Section 2.2.3</a>), tooltip molecules may be 
              bonded to the deposition surface in the desired orientation by non-impact 
              dispersal and weak physisorption on the deposition surface, followed 
              by tooltip molecule decapping via targeted energy input producing 
              dangling bonds at the C2 dimer which can then bond into the deposition 
              surface in vacuo, also creating a low density of preferred diamond 
              nucleation sites. In Attachment Method C (<a href="#2.2.4">Section 
              2.2.4</a>), the techniques of conventional solution-phase chemical 
              synthesis are used to attach tooltip molecules to a deposition surface 
              in the preferred orientation, again creating diamond nucleation 
              sites.</p>
<h5> <a name="2.2.1"></a>2.2.1 Surface Nucleation and Choice of Deposition 
              Substrate</h5>
<p><a name="p51"></a>The intention of this invention is to grow a 
              handle molecule as a single crystal of bulk diamond large enough 
              to permit convenient physical manipulation of the attached C2 dimer-bearing 
              tooltip. Since this single crystal will be in the size range of 
              0.1-10 microns, and since sufficient room must be allowed around 
              each single crystal to afford access to a MEMS-scale gripping mechanism, 
              the maximum surface nucleation density appropriate for this process 
              in the preferred embodiment will be ~105 cm-2, giving a mean separation 
              between handle molecule crystals of ~32 microns on the deposition 
              surface. In other embodiments in which much smaller 100 nm handle 
              molecule crystals can be employed with narrower attachment clearances 
              for the external gripping mechanism, the maximum surface nucleation 
              density could be as high as ~109 cm-2, giving a mean separation 
              between surface-grown handle molecule crystals of ~320 nm.</p>
<p><a name="p52"></a>Conventional diamond films grown by CVD on smooth 
              nondiamond substrates are characterized by very low nucleation densities, 
              typically &lt;104 cm-2 when diamond is deposited on a polished silicon 
              wafer surface, which is many orders of magnitude less than that 
              exhibited by most materials [<a href="#R127">127</a>]. (Interestingly, 
              the CVD nucleation density of diamond nanocrystals on an SiO2 substrate 
              is 6 orders of magnitude smaller than on pure silicon [<a href="#R18">18</a>].) 
              The commercial preparation of continuous diamond films requires 
              separately nucleated diamond crystals eventually to grow together 
              to form a single sheet, hence is maximally efficient under conditions 
              of high nucleation density. Therefore diamond film growth procedures 
              often include preliminary substrate preparation techniques which 
              attempt to increase the nucleation density to a practicable level. 
              Such techniques typically involve introduction of surface discontinuities 
              by scratching or abrading the substrate surface with a fine diamond 
              grit powder or paste. Such surface discontinuities either create 
              preferential geometrical sites for diamond crystal nucleation, or 
              more probably embedded residues from the diamond abrading powder 
              may serve as nucleation sites from which diamond growth can occur 
              by accumulation. The presence of carbon particles on the surface 
              of a substrate can provide a high density of nucleation sites for 
              subsequent diamond growth [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. As shown in <a href="#Table6">Table 
              6</a>, despite abrasive surface preparation the nucleation densities 
              for diamond films prepared by such techniques remain relatively 
              low, on the order of ~108 cm-2 (~1 'm-2) (vs. ~1015 cm-2 available 
              atomic sites), and the surface structure of such films is unpredictable 
              and typically exhibits very disordered surface <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s [<a href="#R127">127</a>]. 
              Nucleation has also been enhanced by coating substrate surfaces 
              with a thin (10-20 nm) layer of hydrocarbon oil [<a href="#R83">83</a>].</p>

<p><a name="p53"></a>Since the purpose of this invention is to grow 
              isolated micron-scale diamond single crystals over tooltip molecule 
              nucleation sites, rather than a continuous diamond film, the deposition 
              surface ideally is chosen so as to minimize the number of natural 
              (non-tooltip molecule) nucleation sites. If tooltip molecules are 
              attached at a number density of ~105 cm-2 to a surface of polished 
              silicon otherwise having no pretreatment, the number density of 
              naturally occurring nucleation sites can be held to at most 103-105 
              cm-2. This implies that from 50% to 99% of the isolated micron-scale 
              diamond single crystals that are grown during <a href="#Step3">Step 
              3</a> (<a href="#2.3">Section 2.3</a>) will be correctly nucleated 
              by surface-bound undimerized tooltip molecules. An SPM scan of the 
              deposition surface, following the completion of <a href="#Step2">Step 
              2</a> but prior to the commencement of <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>, 
              can identify and map the positions of all of the undimerized surface-bound 
              tooltip molecules, so that the isolated micron-scale diamond single 
              crystals that are later grown and properly nucleated by surface-bound 
              tooltip molecules can be identified prior to selection and detachment 
              in <a href="#Step4">Step 4</a> (<a href="#2.4">Section 2.4</a>).</p>
<p><a name="p54"></a>As noted by May [<a href="#R85">85</a>], most 
              of the CVD diamond films reported to date have been grown on single-crystal 
              Si wafers, mainly due to the availability, low cost, and favorable 
              properties of Si wafers. But this is not the only possible substrate 
              material. Candidate substrates for diamond handle molecule crystal 
              growth must satisfy five <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant basic criteria [<a href="#R85">85</a>], 
              the first four of which are summarized quantitatively in <a href="#Table7">Table 
              7</a>.</p>
<p><u><a name="p55"></a>First</u>, the substrate must have a melting 
              point (at the process pressure) higher than the temperature required 
              for diamond growth (at least 300-500 oC, but normally greater than 
              700 oC). This precludes the use of low-melting-point materials such 
              as plastics, aluminum, certain glasses and some electronic materials 
              such as GaAs as a deposition substrate, when hydrogenic diamond 
              CVD techniques are employed in <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a> (<a href="#2.3">Section 
              2.3</a>).</p>
<p><u><a name="p56"></a>Second</u>, for growing diamond films the 
              substrate material should have a thermal expansion coefficient comparable 
              with that of diamond, since at the high growth temperatures currently 
              used, a substrate will tend to expand, and thus the diamond coating 
              will be grown upon and bonded directly to an expanded substrate. 
              Upon cooling, the substrate will contract back to its room temperature 
              size, whereas the diamond coating, with its very small expansion 
              coefficient, will be relatively unaffected by the temperature change, 
              causing the diamond film to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> significant compressive stresses 
              from the shrinking substrate, leading to bowing of the sample, and/or 
              cracking, flaking or even delamination of the entire film [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. 
              However, a nondiamond deposition surface for growing diamond tool 
              handle molecules, starting from surface-bound tooltip molecule nuclei, 
              should incorporate the maximum possible thermal expansion mismatch 
              between the substrate and diamond, producing thermal stresses upon 
              cooling that can facilitate tool separation from the nondiamond 
              deposition surface in <a href="#Step4">Step 4</a> (<a href="#2.4">Section 
              2.4</a>).</p>
<p><u><a name="p57"></a>Third</u>, a mismatch in the crystal lattice 
              constant [<a href="#R86">86</a>, <a href="#R87">87</a>] between 
              the diamond comprising the tool handle molecule and the nondiamond 
              substrate greatly reduces the bonding opportunities between handle 
              molecule and substrate, during handle molecule growth (<a href="#2.3">Section 
              2.3</a>). An extensive interfacial misfit also facilitates tool 
              separation from the nondiamond deposition surface in <a href="#Step4">Step 
              4</a> (<a href="#2.4">Section 2.4</a>).</p>
<p><u><a name="p58"></a>Fourth</u>, in order to form adherent diamond 
              films it is a customary requirement that the substrate material 
              should be capable of forming a carbide layer to a certain extent, 
              since diamond CVD on nondiamond substrates usually involves the 
              formation of a thin carbide interfacial layer upon which the diamond 
              then grows. The carbide layer is viewed as a &#8220;glue&#8221; 
              which promotes diamond growth and aids its adhesion by (partial) 
              relief of interfacial stresses caused by lattice mismatch and substrate 
              contraction [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. However, the ideal nondiamond 
              deposition surface for growing diamond tool handle molecules, starting 
              from surface-bound tooltip molecule nuclei, is a substrate that 
              resists or prohibits carbide formation. The absence of carbide on 
              the nondiamond deposition surface (a) discourages downgrowth of 
              the tool handle molecule into the substrate, (b) helps maintain 
              the isolation of the finished tooltip apex, and (c) facilitates 
              tool separation from the nondiamond deposition surface in <a href="#Step4">Step 
              4</a> (<a href="#2.4">Section 2.4</a>). On the basis of carbide 
              exclusion, potential substrate materials including metals, alloys 
              and pure elements can be subdivided into three broad classes [<a href="#R85">85</a>, 
              <a href="#R88">88</a>], in descending order of preference for the 
              present invention:</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p59"></a>(1) <i>Carbide Exclusion</i>. 
              Metals such as Cu, Sn, Pb, Ag and Au, as well as non-metals such 
              as Ge and sapphire/alumina (Al2O3), have little or no solubility 
              or reaction with C. These materials do not form a carbide layer, 
              and so any diamond layer that might try to form will not adhere 
              well to the surface (which is known as a way to make free-standing 
              diamond films, as the films will often readily delaminate after 
              deposition). These are the best materials for a deposition surface 
              upon which to grow detachable diamond tool handle molecules nucleated 
              by surface-bound tooltip molecules. Unwanted natural nucleation 
              centers are unlikely to arise on polished non-pretreated surfaces 
              and downgrowth from the tooltip molecule seed or the growing tool 
              handle structure, towards the substrate, will be resisted by these 
              surfaces.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p60"></a>(2) <i>Carbon Solvation</i>. 
              Metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ni, Ti and Fe exhibit substantial mutual 
              solubility or reaction with C (all industrially important ferrous 
              materials such as iron and stainless steel cannot be diamond coated 
              using simple CVD methods) [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. During CVD, a 
              substrate composed of these metals acts as a carbon sink whereupon 
              deposited carbon dissolves into the surface, forming a solid solution. 
              This dissolution transports large quantities of C into the bulk, 
              rather than remaining at the surface where it can promote diamond 
              nucleation [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Often diamond growth on the 
              surface only begins after the substrate is completely saturated 
              with carbon, with carbide finally appearing on the surface, by which 
              time the tool handle molecule may already have grown sufficiently 
              large as a single diamond crystal atop a surface-bound tooltip molecule. 
            </p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a name="p61"></a>(3) <i>Carbide Formation</i>. 
              Metals such as Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Co, Ni, Fe, Y, 
              Al, and certain other rare-<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> metals can form carbide during 
              CVD. In some metals, such as Ti, the interfacial carbide layer continues 
              growing during diamond deposition and can become hundreds of microns 
              thick. Non-metals such as B and Si, and Si-containing compounds 
              such as SiO2, quartz and Si3N4, also form carbide layers, and substrates 
              composed of carbides themselves, such as SiC, WC and TiC, are particularly 
              amenable to diamond deposition [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Surface 
              nucleation rates (cm-2 hr-1) on stable carbide-forming substrates 
              (Si, Mo, W) are 10-100 times higher than on carbide-resistant substrates 
              [<a href="#R89">89</a>], and surface nucleation density (cm-2) on 
              Mo is about 10 times higher than on other carbide-forming substrates 
              (Si, Ni, Ti, Al) under similar deposition conditions [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. 
              If used as polished non-pretreated deposition surfaces for diamond 
              tool handle growth, these materials should only sparsely produce 
              competing diamond crystal nucleation centers during hydrogenic CVD 
              processes. (Diamond cannot be epitaxially grown directly on silicon 
              or GaAs substrates [<a href="#R91">91</a>].) However, carbon dimers 
              that are present in the feedstock gases during low-temperature nonhydrogenic 
              CVD can insert into Si and SiO2 surfaces, readily producing silicon 
              carbide [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Additionally, as the CVD process 
              continues, carbide-forming materials may permit some unwanted downgrowth 
              from the surface-bound tooltip molecule or growing tool handle structure, 
              towards the substrate. Note that bombardment of surfaces, particularly 
              refractory metal surfaces such as tungsten, with fullerene ions 
              having energies from about 0.0025-250 MeV results in implantation 
              of carbon and the formation of surface or subsurface carbides [<a href="#R11">11</a>].</p>

<p><u><a name="p62"></a>Dimer Release Criterion</u>. In addition to 
              these four basic factors, a fifth criterion in the choice of deposition 
              substrate material is that the tooltip molecule should bind the 
              C2 dimer more strongly than the deposition surface, so that when 
              the finished tool is pulled away from the deposition surface in 
              <a href="#Step4">Step 4</a> (<a href="#2.4">Section 2.4</a>), the 
              dimer will stay attached to the tool and not remain on the deposition 
              surface. If the dimer stays with the tool, then the result is a 
              tool with an active tip ready to perform diamond mechanosynthesis. 
              If the dimer remains on the deposition surface, the result is a 
              dimerless &#8220;discharged&#8221; tool which must be recharged 
              with C2 dimer by some additional process [<a href="#R38">38</a>] 
              before the tool can be used for diamond mechanosynthesis. </p>
<p><a name="p63"></a>A full computational simulation of the interaction 
              between complete modeled deposition surfaces and the DCB6-Ge tooltip 
              has not yet been done. However, a preliminary evaluation has examined 
              the energy minima of a tooltip that is first joined to a deposition 
              surface through the dimer (EJ) and is then pulled away from the 
              deposition surface, for Dimer-on-Tooltip (EDoT) and Dimer-on-Surface 
              (EDoS) configurations, where the &#8220;surfaces&#8221; are crudely 
              modeled as follows: C (diamond), Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb surface as a 
              single nonterminated 10-atom adamantane-like cage, with the tooltip 
              dimer bonded to 2 adjacent cage atoms; Cu surface as 4 Cu atoms 
              arranged in a square, with the tooltip dimer bonded to 2 adjacent 
              Cu atoms; Al2O3 as a single 5-atom chain of alternating Al and O 
              atoms, with the tooltip dimer bonded to the two Al atoms; and C 
              (graphite) as a 3x3 (unit cells) flat single-plane sheet with all 
              perimeter C atoms immobilized. The quantity (EDoS &#8211; EDoT), 
              tabulated in the rightmost column of <a href="#Table8">Table 8</a> 
              for each surface, is negative if the dimer prefers to stick to the 
              surface after the tooltip has been pulled away from the surface, 
              and is positive if the dimer prefers to stick to the tooltip after 
              the tooltip has been pulled away from the surface, the desired result. 
              (This is only a crude analysis because the quantity (EDoS &#8211; 
              EDoT) really informs us only as to whether the total process of 
              charged tooltip deposition plus discharged tooltip retraction is 
              endo- or exothermic, not the reaction direction or preference.) 
              Since surfaces composed of the larger-radius Ag and Au atoms should 
              bind the dimer less strongly than Cu, it appears that all &#8220;carbide 
              exclusion&#8221; deposition surface materials listed in <a href="#Table7">Table 
              7</a> (with the possible exception of Cu, whose (EDoS &#8211; EDoT) 
              is slightly negative; <a href="#Table8">Table 8</a>), and graphite, 
              at least tentatively satisfy this additional dimer-release criterion. 
              Note that a release energy (EJ &#8211; EDoT) &lt; 0 for all deposition 
              surface in <a href="#Table8">Table 8</a> suggests a thermodynamic 
              preference for a decapped tooltip molecule to bind to the deposition 
              surface.</p>

<p><a name="p64"></a>Taking all five factors into account (Tables 
              <a href="#Table7">7</a> and <a href="#Table8">8</a>), &#8220;carbide 
              exclusion&#8221; materials are the optimal substrate for diamond 
              handle molecule crystal growth, and thus constitute the preferred 
              embodiment of this invention. Graphene sheets (e.g., graphite, carbon 
              nanotubes) may also be used with nonhydrogenic CVD processes, since 
              atomic hydrogen etches graphene, although there exists a preferential 
              epitaxial lattice registry relationship between the diamond C(111) 
              and graphite (0001) surfaces, and similarly between the diamond 
              C(110) and graphite (1120) surfaces [<a href="#R84">84</a>], which 
              might encourage non-tooltip-molecule nucleation. Furthermore, any 
              conventional substrate material suitable for the deposition of CVD 
              diamond thereon may be employed as the substrate utilized in the 
              present invention, though perhaps with decreased efficiency or convenience. 
              Thus the substrate material could be a metal, a metal carbide, a 
              metal nitride, or a ceramic &#8211; e.g., silicon carbide, tungsten 
              carbide, molybdenum, boron, boron nitride, niobium, graphite, copper, 
              aluminum nitride, silver, iron, steel, nickel, silicon, alumina, 
              or silica [<a href="#R5">5</a>], or combinations thereof including 
              cermets such as Al2O3-Fe, TiC-Ni, TiC-Co, TiC-TiN, or B4C-Fe systems 
              [<a href="#R110">110</a>]. Finally, specialized surface treatments 
              may be applied to the deposition surface in order to suppress natural 
              nucleation &#8211; for example, ion implantation of Ar+ ions (3 
              x 1015 ions/cm2 at 100 KeV) on silicon substrate is known to decrease 
              nucleation density [<a href="#R111">111</a>].</p>
<h5> <a name="2.2.2"></a>2.2.2 Tooltip Attachment Method A: Ion Bombardment 
              in Vacuo</h5>
<p><a name="p65"></a>Tooltip molecules may be bonded to the deposition 
              surface in the desired orientation via low-energy ion bombardment 
              of the deposition surface in vacuo, creating a low density of preferred 
              diamond nucleation sites. This is similar to the recognized pretreatment 
              method of (for example) As+ ion implantation (1014 ions/cm2 at 100 
              KeV) on silicon substrate [<a href="#R112">112</a>, <a href="#R113">113</a>] 
              which yields a typical nucleation density of 105-106 nuclei/cm2, 
              up from 104 in the absence of such ion implantation treatment [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. 
              Ion-beam implantation of C+ ions to form diamond-like carbon (DLC) 
              films on various atomically clean substrates in chambers maintained 
              at &lt;10-9 torr are well-known [<a href="#R114">114</a>-<a href="#R118">118</a>, 
              <a href="#R137">137</a>], including gold [<a href="#R118">118</a>] 
              and copper [<a href="#R119">119</a>] surfaces, and halogen atoms 
              have been partially substituted for hydrogen in DLC deposited on 
              metal substrate in photosensor applications [<a href="#R120">120</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p66"></a>The specifics of Attachment Method A in the present 
              invention are as follows. First, capped tooltip molecules (<a href="#2.1">Section 
              2.1</a>) are supplied to an ionization source. A vapor of capped 
              tooltip molecules is created by heating in a <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> chamber (e.g., 
              C60 has a vapor pressure of 0.001 torr at 500 oC [<a href="#R17">17</a>]). 
              The vaporized capped tooltip molecules are next ionized by at least 
              one of the procedures of <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> ablation, electron bombardment, electron 
              attachment, or photoionization. The capped tooltip molecule ions 
              are then electrostatically accelerated to form a low-energy, highly 
              dilute tooltip molecule ion beam, a well-known <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> [<a href="#R121">121</a>]. 
              The ion beam is then directed in a scanning pattern across the deposition 
              surface in vacuo. Upon striking the surface, the tooltip molecule 
              ions (<a href="#Figure7A">Figure 7A</a>) may partially fragment 
              with the release of the capping group, producing dangling bonds 
              at the C2 dimer which can then insert into the substrate surface 
              (<a href="#Figure7B">Figure 7B</a>). This beam energy transferred 
              to the tooltip molecule upon impact should not significantly exceed 
              7.802 eV, the minimum energy required to entirely remove the C2 
              dimer from an uncapped DCB6-Ge tooltip molecule [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. 
              (This is considerably lower than the 10-80 eV ions studied by Sinnott 
              et al [<a href="#R145">145</a>] to functionalize carbon nanotubes 
              (CNTs) by similar means, the 10-300 eV C+ ion beams used to grow 
              diamond-like carbon films on various substrates [<a href="#R118">118</a>], 
              and the &gt;250 eV needed to fragment fullerene ions into free C2 
              dimer radicals [<a href="#R11">11</a>].) Another outcome is that 
              only one capping group is released, bonding the tooltip molecule 
              to the surface with only one bond through the C2 dimer (<a href="#Figure7C">Figure 
              7C</a>). <a href="#Table9">Table 9</a> shows that this 1-bond outcome 
              is energetically comparable to the 2-bond outcome, in the case an 
              iodine cap and a graphite surface. Yet another possible outcome 
              is that the tooltip molecule bonds to the surface at its base through 
              either one (<a href="#Figure7D">Figure 7D</a>) or two (<a href="#Figure7E">Figure 
              7E</a>) bonds, releasing an H or H2, respectively, though neither 
              base-bonding outcome is energetically preferred compared to the 
              desired dimer-bonding outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="p68"></a>However, the removal energy for a single passivating 
              hydrogen atom in the base of the tooltip molecule is 3.519 eV for 
              an H atom removed from the bottom of the tooltip molecule base, 
              comparable to many of the capping group removal energies listed 
              in <a href="#Table10">Table 10</a>. Given the random orientation 
              of tooltip molecules upon their arrival at (and impact with) the 
              deposition surface, the sweep of a dilute beam of tooltip molecule 
              ions across the surface will result in a thin scattering of tooltip 
              molecules attached to the surface in a variety of orientations&#8211;some 
              bound by two bonds to the uncapped dimer (as desired), others bound 
              by only one bond to a partially uncapped dimer, and others bound 
              directly to the tooltip molecule base in various orientations. Simple 
              inspection of potential impact geometries suggests that energy transfer 
              primarily into the dimer capping group upon impact is most probable 
              if the tooltip molecule arrives at the deposition surface within 
              (conservatively) '20<sub>o</sub> of vertical, in tip-down orientation. 
              Therefore the probability of such arrival (assuming a random distribution 
              of tooltip molecule ion orientations in the beam) and hence the 
              probability of a dimer-bonded tooltip molecule (having either 1 
              or 2 bonds to the surface through the C<sub>2</sub> dimer) is roughly 
              (40<sup>o</sup>/360<sup>o</sup>)2 ~ 1%, among all tooltip molecules 
              that become bonded to the deposition surface.</p>
<p><a name="p69"></a>Given a ~1% success rate, after the bombardment 
              process and prior to the commencement of <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a> 
              the surface should be scanned by SPM to find and record the positions 
              of those few tooltip molecules that are bound to the surface in 
              the desired orientation. Depending upon the number density achieved, 
              undesired tooltip molecule nucleation sites might simply be avoided 
              during tool detachment in <a href="#Step4">Step 4</a>. Surface editing 
              is another approach. Due to the low surface nucleation density (<a href="#2.2.1">Section 
              2.2.1</a>), after the aforementioned mapping procedure it may be 
              possible to selectively detach and remove from the surface all attached 
              misoriented tooltip molecules that are detected, e.g., using focused 
              ion beam, electron beam, or NSOM photoionization, subtractively 
              editing the deposition surface prior to commencing CVD in <a href="#Step3">Step 
              3</a>. A second alternative to subtractive editing is additive editing, 
              wherein FIB deposition of new substrate atoms on and around the 
              misoriented tooltip molecule can effectively bury it under a smooth 
              mound of fresh substrate, again preventing nucleation of diamond 
              at that site during <a href="#Step3">Step 3</a>. A third corrective 
              procedure is reparative editing, wherein the methods described in 
              Attachment Method B (<a href="#2.2.3">Section 2.2.3</a>) are employed 
              to fully uncap the only partially uncapped tooltip molecule which 
              has become bonded to the deposition surface (through only one carbon 
              atom of the C<sub>2</sub> dimer) during the ion bombardment process 
              of Attachment Method A. The result of this editing is that in <a href="#Step3">Step 
              3</a>, diamond handle structures will grow only on properly-oriented 
              surface-bound tooltip molecules.</p>
<p><a name="p70"></a>The ability of a chemisorbed (covalently bonded) 
              tooltip molecule to migrate across a deposition surface in vacuo 
              depends strongly upon the chemical structure of both tooltip molecule 
              and the deposition surface material, and temperature. For example, 
              spontaneous surface migration of gold atoms on gold surfaces is 
              well known, though this mobility is greatly reduced at low temperatures 
              and possibly also by alloying with silver or in combinations with 
              other carbide resistant substrate materials. On the other hand, 
              Larsson [<a href="#R122">122</a>] estimates that during conventional 
              diamond CVD on diamond substrate the acetylide radical (C2<sub>H</sub>) 
              has an energy barrier to migration of 3.6 eV across a clean diamond 
              C(111) surface and the methyl radical (CH<sub>3</sub>) has an even 
              higher energy barrier to migration of 3.7 eV; on C(100), estimates 
              for migration barriers range from 1.3-1.9 eV for methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) 
              radicals [<a href="#R123">123</a>, <a href="#R124">124</a>], 1.1-2.7 
              eV for methyl radicals [<a href="#R123">123</a>, <a href="#R125">125</a>], 
              and 1.7 eV for ethylene (C=CH<sub>2</sub>) radicals [<a href="#R124">124</a>]. 
              Taking migration time from the Arrhenius equation as t<sub>migrate</sub><sup>-1</sup> 
              ~ (k<sub>B</sub>T/h) exp(-E<sub>mig</sub>/k<sub>B</sub>T), where 
              h = 6.63 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J-sec (Planck's constant) and k<sub>B</sub> 
              = 1.381 x 10<sup>-23</sup> J/K (Boltzmann&#8217;s constant), then 
              at T = 300 K and E<sub>mig</sub> = 1.1-2.7 eV, t<sub>migrate</sub> 
              ~ 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> sec - 3 x 10<sup>32</sup> sec on diamond substrate, 
              which is very slow. Tooltip molecules have ten times as many atoms 
              per molecule as the aforementioned radicals, hence should exhibit 
              much slower surface migrations at any given temperature.</p>

<p><a name="p72"></a>The specifics of Attachment Method B in the present 
              invention are as follows.</p>
<p><u><a name="p73"></a>First</u>, capped tooltip molecules are dispersed 
              and physisorbed onto the deposition surface by any of several methods. 
              These methods may include (but is not limited to): (1) <i>spin coating</i>, 
              in which a suspension of capped tooltip molecules is applied to 
              the center of a spinning wafer of smooth deposition surface material, 
              and subsequently dispersed across the wafer surface; (2) <i>dip 
              coating</i>, in which a wafer of smooth deposition surface material 
              is dipped into a suspension of capped tooltip molecules and slowly 
              withdrawn; or (3) <i>spray coating</i>, in which a suspension of 
              capped tooltip molecules is applied to the wafer of smooth deposition 
              surface material as a fine spray. All three methods have been successfully 
              employed commercially to apply onto a smooth silicon wafer a dilute 
              coating of 100-200 nm diamond particles to a number density of ~1 
              'm<sup>-2</sup> (~10<sup>8</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>), starting with 
              a suspension of 1 gm diamond particles in 1 liter of isopropanol 
              [<a href="#R126">126</a>-<a href="#R128">128</a>], ethanol [<a href="#R82">82</a>], 
              or methanol [<a href="#R129">129</a>]. In another <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous application 
              [<a href="#R130">130</a>], a layer of hydrocarbon molecules is applied 
              to a substrate by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, whereupon the 
              surface is irradiated with a laser to decompose the layer of molecules 
              at the surface without influencing the substrate; after decomposition 
              the carbon atoms rearrange on the substrate surface to form a DLC 
              film.</p>
<p><a name="p74"></a>It is well-known that simple adamantane (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>), 
              though having one of the highest melting points (542 K) of any hydrocarbon, 
              "sublimes readily at atmospheric pressure and room temperature." 
              [<a href="#R60">60</a>] The enthalpy of sublimation for adamantane 
              is DH<sub>subl</sub> = 58,810 J/mole (~0.61 eV/molecule) [<a href="#R131">131</a>] 
              and the triple point for adamantane is T<sub>triple</sub> = 733 
              K at P<sub>triple</sub> = 2.7 GPa [<a href="#R132">132</a>, <a href="#R133">133</a>], 
              hence from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation the partial pressure 
              of solid adamantane (P<sub>adam</sub>) may be estimated as: ln(P<sub>adam</sub>) 
              = ln(P<sub>triple</sub>) + (DH<sub>subl</sub> / R) (T<sub>triple</sub><sup>-1</sup> 
              - T<sub>adam</sub><sup>-1</sup>) = 31.37 &#8211; (7077 T<sub>adam</sub><sup>-1</sup>), 
              where R = 8.31 J/mole-K (universal gas constant). At T<sub>adam</sub> 
              = 77 K (LN<sub>2</sub> temperature), the partial pressure of adamantane 
              is only 5 x 10<sup>-32</sup> atm, or ~1 sublimed adamantane molecule 
              per 200,000 m<sup>3</sup> of volume at equilibrium, entirely negligible. 
              However, at 300 K, P<sub>adam</sub> = 0.024 atm, or ~1 sublimed 
              adamantane molecule per 1700 nm<sup>3</sup> of volume at equilibrium, 
              a substantial sublimation rate.</p>
<p><a name="p75"></a>The capped triadamantane tooltip molecule, being 
              a larger molecule and containing two or more heavy atoms, should 
              be less easily sublimed under ambient conditions. However, these 
              molecules have not yet been synthesized nor are their precise thermodynamic 
              properties known. Taking adamantane as the worst-case scenario, 
              the surface dispersal conditions most certain to work consist of 
              a suspension of capped tooltip molecules in a liquid nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>) 
              carrier fluid, dispersed onto a smooth deposition surface which 
              is maintained at or slightly below 77 K, the boiling point of LN<sub>2</sub>. 
              After applying the suspension to the deposition surface, the surface 
              temperature may be temporarily elevated to slightly above 77 K to 
              drive off the chemically inert LN<sub>2</sub> carrier fluid, leaving 
              only capped tooltip molecules dispersed in vacuo on the cold deposition 
              substrate surface in the energetically preferred equilibrium position 
              shown in <a href="#Figure8A">Figure 8A</a>. If the selected capped 
              tooltip molecules have a low or negligible sublimation rate at room 
              temperature, then other higher-temperature suspension fluids may 
              be used which are easily evaporatable and compatible with the underlying 
              substrate, i.e., chemically nonreactive with the underlying substrate 
              material(s). For example, fullerenes including C<sub>60</sub> and 
              C<sub>70</sub> have been dispersed onto silicon, silica, and copper 
              surfaces at room temperature using an evaporatable carrier fluid 
              (e.g., toluene), then employed as growth nuclei for microwave plasma 
              diamond film CVD [<a href="#R82">82</a>].</p>
<p><u><a name="p76"></a>Second</u>, the capping group must be induced 
              to debond from the C<sub>2</sub> dimer in the tooltip molecule via 
              excitation of the =C-cap bond. Some crude methods will not work. 
              For example, if the capping atom is iodine, this atom has a large 
              mass and hence a low frequency of vibration in a C-I bond (e.g., 
              ~5.0 x 10<sup>12</sup> Hz at 350 K), so the absorption of a single 
              IR <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> of this frequency would add only ~0.02 eV to the bond, 
              which is insufficient to break it. From <a href="#Table10">Table 
              10</a>, ~1.777 eV is required to break each of the two C-I bonds 
              constituting the capping group of a DCB6-Ge tooltip molecule. This 
              energy corresponds to the absorption of a single 430 THz (~7000 
              ') visible red photon. Laser photoexcitation, photodissociation 
              or photofragmentation [<a href="#R11">11</a>] is commonly used in 
              atom-selective bond breaking to selectively control a chemical reaction, 
              e.g., the photodissociation of iodine atoms from iodopropane ions 
              [<a href="#R134">134</a>]. The requisite bond-breaking energy can 
              be provided by a beam of electrons, noble element ions, or other 
              energetic neutrals [<a href="#R135">135</a>-<a href="#R137">137</a>] 
              directed towards the cooled deposition surface where the capped 
              tooltip molecules reside. Viewed from above in its preferred orientation 
              relative to the deposition surface, the iodine capped tooltip molecule 
              has a cross-sectional area of ~44.42 '<sup>2</sup> of which ~5.05 
              '<sup>2</sup> represents the cross-sectional area of the iodine 
              capping group, hence the beam of photons or ions carrying the debonding 
              energy will strike the capping group, on average, ~10% of the time 
              that they strike a tooltip molecule at all. Much more selectively, 
              an STM tip can be scanned over the cold deposition surface specifically 
              to break the C-I bond via ~1.5 eV single <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a> electrons [<a href="#R138">138</a>-<a href="#R140">140</a>]. 
              For instance, the STM-mediated positionally-controlled single-molecule 
              dissociation of an iodine atom from individual molecules of copper 
              surface-physisorbed iodobenzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I) and 
              diiodobenzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>I<sub>2</sub>) has been 
              demonstrated experimentally by Hla et al [<a href="#R140">140</a>]; 
              in the inelastic tunneling regime, lower-energy electrons can also 
              be injected via a resonance state between tip/substrate and the 
              target molecule, breaking the weak C-I bond in iodobenzene without 
              breaking the stronger C-C or C-H bonds [<a href="#R140">140</a>].</p>
<p><u><a name="p77"></a>Third</u>, once the capping group has been 
              removed and the dangling bonds have been exposed from the C<sub>2</sub> 
              dimer, these bonds can form strong attachments with the deposition 
              substrate surface, thus affixing the tooltip molecule to the deposition 
              surface in the desired tip-down orientation. The energetics of the 
              bond-by-bond decapping procedure for an iodine-capped DCB6-Ge tooltip 
              molecule on a 3x3 unit-cell graphite surface is estimated in <a href="#Figure9">Figure 
              9</a> using semi-empirical AM1 simulations which included four unattached 
              atoms (2H, 2I) to permit total atom count to remain constant throughout 
              all substitutions. After each iodine capping atom is removed, the 
              conversion of the dangling C<sub>2</sub> dimer bond to a new covalent 
              bond between dimer and deposition surface appears to be energetically 
              favored by 1.574 eV for the first bond and by 1.284 eV for the second 
              bond. However, the presence of stray H or I ions can poison this 
              reaction. For example, the dangling dimer bonds will bond to any 
              H ions that are present, in preference to bonding with the deposition 
              surface, so hydrogen must be excluded from the vicinity of the tooltip 
              molecules during this stage of the process. It would be helpful 
              to include a hydrogen getter in the vacuum chamber to absorb any 
              hydrogens that become separated from the tooltip base. Stray iodine 
              ions have a similar effect so it is helpful to include an intermittent 
              positive-voltage getter plate inside the chamber to periodically 
              attract and collect negative iodine ions as they are released from 
              the tooltip caps. However, if the number of purposely decapped iodine 
              atoms or accidentally debonded hydrogen atoms is on the order of 
              ~10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> (<a href="#2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a> 
              and <a href="#Table6">Table 6</a>) in a relatively large vacuum 
              chamber, then an encounter between such stray atoms and a surface-bound 
              tooltip molecule, even in the absence of any countermeasures, should 
              be an exceedingly rare event.</p>

              12</a>), that loses one hydrogen atom in the side position of the

              As before, the unlikely prior recombination of a stray H atom restores

<p><a name="p82"></a>Once a tooltip molecule has established at least 
              one strong bond to the deposition surface, its surface mobility 
              should be extremely low (<a href="#2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</a>). However, 
              prior to such bonding these molecules are only physisorbed to the 
              surface. Isolated pairs of iodine-capped DCB6-Ge tooltip molecules 
              placed in tip-to-tip, tip-to-base, tip-to-side, and base-to-base 
              orientations show weak energy barriers (calculated using semi-empirical 
              AM1) between these configurations of only 0.05-0.09 eV (vs. 0.04 
              eV for (300 K) room temperature, 0.007 eV for (77 K) LN2 temperature), 
              with just a slight preference for the base-to-base orientation. 
              Tooltip molecules placed near each other and tooltip molecules placed 
              several molecule widths apart in the same orientation show almost 
              no energetic preference with separation distance, so tooltip molecules 
              should be distributed randomly across the cold deposition surface. 
              By varying the choices of tooltip molecule, capping group, deposition 
              surface materials, and deposition surface temperature, the speed 
              of tooltip molecule migration across the deposition surface can 
              be made almost arbitrarily slow.</p>
<p><a name="p83"></a>The enthalpy of sublimation for molecular iodine 
              (I2) is DHsubl = 60,800 J/mole (~0.63 eV/molecule) and the vapor 
              pressure over the solid is 6060 Pa at 100 oC [<a href="#R141">141</a>], 
              hence from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation the partial pressure 
              of solid iodine (Piodine) may be estimated as: ln(Piodine) ~ 28.32 
              &#8211; (7316 Tiodine-1). At Tiodine = 77 K (LN2 temperature), the 
              partial pressure of iodine is only 1 x 10-34 atm but at room temperature 
              (Tiodine = 300 K) the partial pressure Piodine = 0.0005 atm, hence 
              any stray iodine that remains physisorbed to the deposition surface 
              after the completion of the decapping procedure may be driven off 
              by gentle heating and sublimation.</p>

<h5><a name="2.2.4"></a>2.2.4 Tooltip Attachment Method C: Solution 
              Chemistry</h5>
<p><a name="p84"></a>Tooltip molecules may be bonded to the deposition 
              surface in the preferred orientation using the techniques of conventional 
              solution-phase chemical synthesis, creating a low density of preferred 
              diamond nucleation sites (<a href="#Figure13">Figure 13</a>).</p>
<p><a name="p85"></a>The specifics of Attachment Method C in the present 
              invention are as follows.</p>
<p><u><a name="p86"></a>First</u>, the deposition surface is functionalized 
              with an appropriate functionalization group. For illustrative purposes, 
              <a href="#Figure13A">Figure 13A</a> shows a section of (10,0) single-walled 
              carbon nanotube (CNT) with a functional group &#8220;X&#8221; attached 
              at the para- isomer positions (1 and 4) in one of the 6-carbon rings 
              in the graphene surface. A capped tooltip is shown above this surface. 
              For this invention, the functionalized deposition surface could 
              be a flat graphene surface (i.e., graphite), or could be a functionalized 
              non-graphene surface such as silicon, germanium, gold, and so forth 
              (see <a href="#Table7">Table 7</a>). Graphite is attacked by strong 
              oxidizing agents (such as sulfuric + nitric acid, or by chromic 
              acid) [<a href="#R142">142</a>], allowing the random surface functionalization 
              of graphene; also, the chemical functionalization of fullerenes 
              is well-studied [<a href="#R143">143</a>-<a href="#R148">148</a>]. 
              Since site-specific functionalization may not be not strictly required 
              in all cases, e-beam irradiation of dilutely surface-dispersed moieties, 
              ion-beam implantation of functional-group ions, electrochemical 
              functionalization [<a href="#R149">149</a>, <a href="#R150">150</a>], 
              or other related techniques could be employed in some cases to attach 
              functional groups on the deposition surface at very high dilution, 
              e.g., at 1 micron separations. However, direct chemical modification 
              of surfaces via SPM tip [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R140">140</a>] 
              enables the functionalization of the deposition surface at specific 
              atomic sites, in cases where this is necessary.</p>

              or Au. The attachment reaction could be enhanced in the case of 
              a nanotube deposition surface by using a kinked CNT, then anticipating 
              the tooltip to preferentially attach at the kink site where CNTs

              this: nanocrystal growth (<a href="#2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</a>) and 
              direct handle bonding (<a href="#2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</a>).</p>
<h5> <a name="2.3.1"></a>2.3.1 Handle Attachment Method A: Nanocrystal 
              Growth</h5>
<p><a name="p91"></a>In Method A, a bulk diamond deposition process 
              (see below) is applied simultaneously to the entire tooltip-containing 
              deposition surface (e.g., ~1 cm<sup>2</sup>) created in <a href="#Step2">Step 
              2</a>. The adamantane (diamond nanocrystal) base of each bound tooltip 
              molecule serves as a nucleation seed from which a large diamond 
              crystal will grow outward, in preference to growth on areas of the 
              deposition surface where tooltip nucleation seed molecules are absent 
              (<a href="#Figure14">Figure 14</a>). Deposition should proceed until 
              a sufficient quantity of bulk diamond crystal has grown outward 
              and around the tooltip seed molecule such that the tooltip and its 
              newly grown handle can be securely grasped by a MEMS-scale manipulator 
              mechanism. The deposition process should be halted before adjacent 
              growing crystals <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> into a single film. As noted in <a href="#2.2">Section 
              2.2</a>, the number density of tools on the surface is controlled 
              by limiting the number density of tooltip seed molecules attached 
              to the deposition surface during <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a>. As 
              distinguished from the more complex ex post strategy of chemically 
              attaching a capped tooltip molecule to a larger prefabricated handle 
              molecule, in the process described here the handle is grown directly 
              onto the surface-bound tooltip, creating an optimally rigid and 
              durable unitary mechanosynthetic tool structure. Alternatively and 
              less preferred, the growing diamond crystal handle structure can 
              be covalently bonded to some other appropriate large rigid structure 
              such as a CNT, tungsten, or diamond-shard AFM tip, or an EBID/FIB-deposited 
              metal or carbon column, e.g., by growing a vertical column of DLC 
              atop the properly oriented tooltip molecule using a focused beam 
              of hydrocarbon or C<sup>+</sup> ions [<a href="#R114">114</a>-<a href="#R118">118</a>].</p>

<p><a name="p92"></a>The most useful bulk deposition process is conventional 
              diamond CVD, wherein micron/hour or faster deposition rates are 
              typically demonstrated experimentally. The initial deposition rate 
              onto the starting seed may be slow, but this rate should rapidly 
              increase as more of the diamond handle structure is laid down during 
              the deposition process which will require times on the order of 
              hours. Traditional high-temperature CVD uses a large excess of atomic 
              hydrogen which will etch a graphite or graphene surface, but CVD 
              diamond can be deposited slowly at temperatures as low as 280-350 
              <sup>o</sup>C if necessary using the nonhydrogenic Argonne Lab C<sub>60</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>-dimer 
              approach [<a href="#R175">175</a>, <a href="#R176">176</a>] (<a href="#1.1C">Section 
              1.1(C)</a>) which uses very little atomic H, in which case graphene 
              etching would no longer be a serious problem. (Thermal suppression 
              of nucleation at 1000 <sup>o</sup>C has been discussed by McCune 
              [<a href="#R3">3</a>].)</p>
<p><a name="p93"></a>Does the CVD process deposit sp<sup>3</sup>-bonded 
              diamond, not sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded graphite, onto such a tiny nucleation 
              seed as the triadamantane base structure of the tooltip molecule? 
              Conditions in vapor deposition of thin films require a critical 
              nucleus size only on the order of a few atoms [<a href="#R177">177</a>]. 
              Under these conditions the free energy of formation of a critical 
              nucleus may be negative [<a href="#R177">177</a>] and the surface 
              energy contribution may cause a reverse effect on the graphite-diamond 
              phase stability [<a href="#R178">178</a>, <a href="#R179">179</a>], 
              a situation called nonclassical nucleation process [<a href="#R177">177</a>]. 
              Simple thermodynamic calculations by Badziag et al [<a href="#R180">180</a>] 
              and others [<a href="#R178">178</a>, <a href="#R179">179</a>] have 
              confirmed that hydrogen-terminated diamond nuclei &lt;3 nm in diameter 
              should have a lower energy than hydrogen-terminated graphite nuclei 
              with the same number of carbon atoms, and that for surface bonds 
              terminated with H atoms, diamonds smaller than ~3 nm are energetically 
              favored over polycyclic aromatics (the precursors to graphite).</p>
<p><a name="p94"></a>In 1983, Matsumato and Matsui [<a href="#R19">19</a>], 
              and later in 1990, Sato [<a href="#R20">20</a>] and Olah [<a href="#R21">21</a>], 
              suggested that hydrocarbon cage molecules such as adamantane, bicyclooctane, 
              tetracyclododecane, hexacyclopentadecane, and dodecahedrane could 
              possibly serve as <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s for the homogeneous nucleation of diamond 
              in gas phase. The adamantane molecule (C<sub>10</sub>M/sub&gt;H<sub>16</sub>) 
              is the smallest combination of carbon atoms possessing the diamond 
              unit cage structure, i.e., three six-member rings in a chair conformation. 
              The tetracyclododecane and hexacyclopentadecane molecules represent 
              twinned diamond embryos that were proposed as precursors to the 
              fivefold twinned diamond microcrystals prevalent in CVD diamond 
              films &#8211; from simple atomic structure comparisons, the diamond 
              lattice is easily generated from these cage compounds by simple 
              hydrogen abstraction followed by carbon addition [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. 
              However, in one experiment adamantane placed on a molybdenum deposition 
              surface during acetylene-oxygen combustion CVD failed to nucleate 
              diamond growth [<a href="#R181">181</a>], possibly due to &#8220;a 
              fast transformation of adamantane on molybdenum to molybdenum carbide 
              under diamond growth conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="p95"></a>The first successful demonstration of the ability 
              of surface-bound single-cage adamantane molecules to serve as nucleation 
              seeds for diamond CVD was achieved experimentally by the Giraud 
              group [<a href="#R161">161</a>-<a href="#R164">164</a>] during 1998-2001. 
              In this process, a special seed molecule &#8211; 2,2-divinyladamantane 
              (DVA), a single-cage adamantane with two vinyl (-CH=CH<sub>2</sub>) 
              groups bonded to the same carbon atom in the cage&#8211;is synthesized 
              using conventional solution phase techniques [<a href="#R161">161</a>], 
              then dispersed onto a polished hydrogen-terminated Si(111) surface. 
              When a surface prepared in this way is subjected to microwave plasma 
              CVD using an H<sub>2</sub>-rich 1% CH<sub>4</sub> feedstock gas 
              at 40 mbar and 850 <sup>o</sup>C for 2 hours, only a few diamond 
              grains are observed during subsequent SEM inspection, with a nucleation 
              density below ~10<sup>4</sup> cm-<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#R163">163</a>]. 
              However, when the surface is additionally exposed to UV irradiation 
              from a xenon arc lamp for 24 hours prior to CVD, photochemical double 
              hydrosilylation occurs, fixing the seed molecule via two -C-C- tethers 
              to two adjacent silicon atoms on the Si(111) surface with minimal 
              steric strain. With the seed molecule thus tethered to the silicon 
              surface, the CVD process is then run again as previously described, 
              this time resulting in a diamond nucleation density that rises to 
              ~10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> and producing a very homogeneous 
              diamond size of ~2 microns [<a href="#R163">163</a>] (indicating 
              essentially all adamantane-based nucleations), as shown in <a href="#Figure15">Figure 
              15</a>.</p>

<p><a name="p96"></a>Giraud et al [<a href="#R163">163</a>] notes 
              that although the treatment should densely cover the surface with 
              covalently bound adamantane seed molecules, &#8220;the subsequent 
              CVD plasma conditions will remove all the singly and presumably 
              a few doubly attached molecules. The fact that nucleated diamonds 
              were effectively obtained...shows the stability of grafted DVA in 
              the nucleation conditions. All the samples treated without...UV...suffered 
              no nucleation. This nucleation method therefore offers, on top of 
              the advantage of flexibility and mildness, the possibility of photolithographic 
              nucleation: diamonds adopt a homogeneous spatial repartition in 
              the center of the irradiated region, with a well-faceted shape due 
              to their cubic structure, while nucleation density sharply decreases 
              to ~5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> on the brink of the irradiated 
              region without even using a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> mask.&#8221; In sum, doubly bonded 
              adamantane seed molecules nucleate the growth diamond &#8220;handle&#8221; 
              crystals, whereas singly bonded or unbonded seed molecules are removed 
              by the hot CVD process and thus produce no crystal growth.</p>
<p><a name="p97"></a>Even though the core of the tooltip molecule 
              is iceane (the unit cell of hexagonal diamond or lonsdaleite) and 
              not pure adamantane as in conventional cubic diamond crystal, lonsdaleite 
              can also be grown experimentally [<a href="#R73">73</a>-<a href="#R76">76</a>]. 
              The Raman spectra of lonsdaleite has been reported [<a href="#R182">182</a>] 
              and detected in localized stacking defect <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s in textured CVD 
              films [<a href="#R183">183</a>]. Crystals of hexagonal diamond have 
              been prepared in both static and shock high-pressure laboratory 
              experiments [<a href="#R184">184</a>, <a href="#R185">185</a>], 
              and directly from cubic diamond [<a href="#R186">186</a>]. Lonsdaleite 
              can also be reliably synthesized [<a href="#R187">187</a>] using 
              rf-assisted plasma CVD and pure acetylene gas as the carbon source 
              with no hydrogen &#8211; Roul et al [<a href="#R188">188</a>] reports 
              that crystallites grown on Si(100) substrates consisted mainly of 
              polytypes of hexagonal diamond with a little cubic diamond and a 
              few higher-order hydrocarbon phases, and others have found diamond 
              polytypes in CVD diamond films [<a href="#R189">189</a>]. Both cis 
              and trans boat-boat bicyclodecane and related multiply-twinned compounds 
              have been suggested as possible lonsdaleite nucleators based on 
              the presence of both boat and chair hexagonal carbon rings [<a href="#R190">190</a>, 
              <a href="#R191">191</a>]. Twinning &#8211; the stacking of alternating 
              (as in lonsdaleite) or arbitrarily-ordered re-entrant and intersecting 
              chair and boat planes &#8211; is commonly seen in CVD diamond [<a href="#R191">191</a>-<a href="#R195">195</a>]. 
              A semi-empirical theoretical analysis of the lonsdaleite structure 
              by Burgos et al [<a href="#R196">196</a>] gives results in <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able 
              accord with the limited experimental data. L.V. Zhigilei et al [<a href="#R197">197</a>] 
              note that intermediate states during the reconstruction of the C(111) 
              surface of cubic diamond can lead to growth processes which result 
              in the formation of a stacking fault, or twin plane [<a href="#R198">198</a>-<a href="#R200">200</a>], 
              which could in turn produce lonsdaleite [<a href="#R201">201</a>], 
              and other transition mechanisms have been proposed [<a href="#R202">202</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p98"></a>As noted by Battaile et al [<a href="#R203">203</a>], 
              experimentally grown CVD diamond crystallites can exhibit C(100) 
              and C(111) facets [<a href="#R204">204</a>-<a href="#R206">206</a>]. 
              The C(110) surfaces are not usually observed (except in (110)-oriented 
              homoepitaxy [<a href="#R207">207</a>, <a href="#R208">208</a>]) 
              because they grow much faster than the C(111) and C(100) faces [<a href="#R204">204</a>, 
              <a href="#R210">210</a>], hence are normally terminated by (100) 
              and (111) facets. Diamond deposition rates in a hot-filament CVD 
              reactor at 1200 K from methyl radical are typically 1.3-2.0 'm/hr 
              for C(110) [<a href="#R209">209</a>, <a href="#R210">210</a>] but 
              only 0.5 'm/hr for C(111) and just 0.4-0.5 'm/hr for C(100) [<a href="#R209">209</a>-<a href="#R212">212</a>]. 
              With the tooltip molecule bound to the deposition surface in the 
              preferred orientation (i.e., inverted), the C(110) plane is angled 
              at 45<sup>o</sup> from vertical, leaning away from the vertical 
              centerline; the C(100) plane is also angled at 45<sup>o</sup> from 
              vertical, but leans toward the vertical centerline; the C(111) plane 
              goes straight up along the centerline. So under CVD deposition, 
              the tool handle structure will grow fastest outward at 45<sup>o</sup>. 
              The C(100) plane will be buried inside the tool, and the tool handle 
              crystal will exhibit C(110) facets on the sides and a C(111) facet 
              on the top. (Plasma CVD diamond crystallites grown on Si(100) wafers 
              also display a combination of C(111) and C(110) facets [<a href="#R6">6</a>].) 
              Note that while lonsdaleite has a repeating structure, here we should 
              expect only a single twinning fault at the centerplane, not a series 
              of repeating twinnings. However, geometry dictates that the detached 
              tool cannot be concave on its active face, and would at worst be 
              flat, hence even at minimum can serve as a primitive tool to experimentally 
              demonstrate positionally controlled diamond mechanosynthesis.</p>
<p><a name="p99"></a>Diamond films have been formed by immersing a 
              substrate in a fluid medium comprising a carbon-containing precursor 
              and irradiating the substrate with a laser to pyrolyze the precursor, 
              a technique that could also be adapted to grow diamond handle structures 
              onto isolated surface-bound tooltip molecules. For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">Hacker</a> 
              et al [<a href="#R213">213</a>] describe a process in which gas 
              containing an aliphatic acid or an aromatic carboxylic anhydride 
              that vaporizes without decomposition is passed over a substrate 
              and irradiated with a focused high-powered pulsed laser, depositing 
              a diamond film. In the process disclosed by Neifeld [<a href="#R214">214</a>], 
              the substrate is immersed in a liquid containing carbon and hydrogen, 
              e.g. methanol, and a laser pulse is then directed through the liquid 
              coating to heat the substrate. The liquid is pyrolyzed and carbon 
              material from the pyrolyzed liquid grows on the substrate to form 
              a diamond coating on the substrate. Yu [<a href="#R130">130</a>] 
              applies a hydrocarbon layer to a substrate by the Langmuir-Blodgett 
              technique, then irradiates the surface with a laser (or e-beam, 
              x-rays, etc.) to decompose the layer of molecules at the surface 
              without influencing the substrate; after decomposition, the carbon 
              atoms rearrange on the surface of the substrate to form a DLC film. 
              Bovenkerk et al [<a href="#R4">4</a>] proposes using an unusual 
              dual gas approach to CVD in which, for example, a hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) 
              or methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) feedstock gas is alternated with a carbon 
              tetraiodide (CI<sub>4</sub>) feedstock gas, with each exposure resulting 
              in the deposition of a new diamond monolayer on an existing diamond 
              substrate, and alternative lower-temperature CVD gas chemistries 
              are being investigated such as use of CO<sub>2</sub>-based [<a href="#R215">215</a>] 
              or halogen-containing [<a href="#R216">216</a>] gas mixtures. Finally, 
              laser heating of solid CO<sub>2</sub> at 30-80 GPa pressure causes 
              the molecule to decompose into oxygen and diamond, revealing a new 
              region of the CO<sub>2</sub> phase diagram with a boundary having 
              a negative P-T slope [<a href="#R217">217</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p100"></a>There are several other lesser-known alternatives 
              to CVD, ion beam deposition, and laser pyrolysis which might also 
              be adapted for growing the handle structure onto the surface-bound 
              tooltip molecule. Diamond film prepared by physical vapor deposition 
              has been described by Namba et al [<a href="#R218">218</a>]. Liquid-phase 
              diamond synthesis in boiling benzene or in molten lead was reported 
              as early as 1905 [<a href="#R219">219</a>], and more recently, a 
              2% yield of diamond from carbon tetrachloride in liquid sodium at 
              700<sup>o</sup>C [<a href="#R220">220</a>] and the electrochemical 
              growth of diamond films below 50<sup>o</sup>C in liquid ethanol 
              [<a href="#R157">157</a>] and in solutions of ammonium acetate in 
              liquid acetic acid [<a href="#R158">158</a>], and also the hydrothermal 
              synthesis of diamond [<a href="#R221">221</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p101"></a>A final consideration is the overall temperature 
              stability of the bound tooltip molecule under the conditions of 
              CVD growth and related processes. One concern is that the tooltip 
              molecule might destabilize if heated to CVD temperatures. Pure adamantane 
              graphitizes at &gt;480<sup>o</sup>C [<a href="#R60">60</a>], and 
              early thermodynamic equilibrium calculations [<a href="#R222">222</a>, 
              <a href="#R223">223</a>] showed that these and similar low molecular 
              weight hydrocarbons are not stable at high temperatures (&gt;600<sup>o</sup>C) 
              in the harsh CVD environment. Another concern is that at elevated 
              temperatures, the tooltip molecule might debond from the deposition 
              surface. However, the work of the Giraud group [<a href="#R161">161</a>-<a href="#R164">164</a>] 
              with the 2,2-divinyladamantane nucleation molecule for diamond CVD 
              confirms experimentally that adamantane molecules having two tethers 
              to a silicon deposition surface can survive at least 2 hours of 
              CVD conditions at 850<sup>o</sup>C without destabilizing or detaching 
              from the surface, although adamantanes with only one or no bonds 
              to the surface evidently may be detached or destroyed at these temperatures. 
              <a href="#Table8">Table 8</a> gives the release energy (E<sup>J</sup> 
              &#8211; E<sup>DoT</sup>) for a decapped tooltip molecule bound to 
              a Ge deposition surface as ~4.7 eV. If the activation energy (reaction 
              barrier) is of similar magnitude, then from the Arrhenius equation 
              (<a href="#2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</a>) the mean detachment time for 
              a decapped tooltip molecule bound to a Ge deposition surface at 
              850<sup>o</sup>C is ~5 x 10<sup>7</sup> sec (&gt;1 year). For some 
              deposition surface materials the tooltip release energy (and reaction 
              barrier) can be considerably lower, so it may be necessary to employ 
              a lower-temperature CVD process to obtain an acceptably long thermal 
              detachment time for some substrates. Successful low-temperature 
              CVD of diamond crystallites or DLC films have been reported at temperatures 
              as low as 250-750 <sup>o</sup>C [<a href="#R224">224</a>], 280-350

<p><a name="p103"></a>The specific sequence of events is as follows:</p>
<p><a name="p104"></a>(1) <u>Prepare tooltip molecules</u>. Bond tooltip 
              molecules to the deposition surface in the preferred orientation, 
              as described in <a href="#Step2">Step 2</a> (<a href="#2.2">Section 
              2.2</a>).</p>
<p><a name="p105"></a>(2) <u>Mount diamond AFM tip</u>. Mount a diamond 
              shard as the working tip of an AFM. The apex of the shard should 
              be flat or convex in cross-section, and the apical tip surface of 
              the shard should expose the diamond C(110) crystal face.</p>
<p><a name="p106"></a>(3) <u>Depassivate AFM tip</u>. The AFM tip 
              is baked in vacuo at &gt;1300 K to completely dehydrogenate the 
              entire diamond shard, including most importantly its C(110) apical 
              tip surface. The C(110) surface does not reconstruct during thermal 
              depassivation [<a href="#R225">225</a>].</p>
<p><a name="p107"></a>(4) <u>Lower tip onto surface</u>. The depassivated 
              diamond shard tip is positioned perpendicular to the deposition 
              surface upon which the tooltip molecules are affixed in the preferred 
              orientation. The shard tip is then lowered toward the deposition 
              surface (<a href="#Figure16A">Figure 16A</a>), in vacuo at room 
              temperature.</p>
<p><a name="p108"></a>(5) <u>Bind shard to tooltip molecule</u>. As 
              the apical tip surface of the diamond shard reaches and contacts 
              the deposition surface, the many dangling bonds at the C(110) crystal 
              face of the apical tip surface bond with several carbon atoms in 
              the base of a tooltip molecule, displacing several passivating hydrogen 
              atoms which migrate to nearby dangling bonds on the diamond shard 
              apical tip surface (<a href="#Figure16B">Figure 16B</a>).</p>
<p><a name="p109"></a>(6) <u>Retract tip from surface</u>. The diamond 
              shard is retracted from the deposition surface in the vertical direction. 
              The tooltip molecule is more strongly bonded to the shard, so the 
              vertical retraction of the shard causes the two bonds to the deposition 
              surface through the C<sub>2</sub> dimer to break (<a href="#Figure16C">Figure 
              16C</a>), creating an active C2 dimer radical exposed at the apical 
              tip surface of the shard. The diamond shard is now an active tool 
              that can be employed in diamond mechanosynthesis.</p>
<p><a name="p110"></a>The process for manufacturing a mechanosynthetic 
              tool via Method B is much inferior to the Method A process for a 
              number of reasons. First, in Method B, after contacting the surface 
              it will be uncertain how many, if any, tooltip molecules have become 
              bonded to the apical tip surface of the diamond shard probe. Second, 
              after the bonds to the deposition surface through the C<sub>2</sub> 
              dimer have been broken, the tooltip molecule is free to rotate and 
              may form additional bonds between the tooltip molecule base and 
              the depassivated apical tip surface, most likely carrying the tooltip 
              molecule out of its vertical orientation and placing it in some 
              unknown, possibly useless, orientation. Third, if the tooltip molecule 
              is bonded to the diamond shard probe through only a minimal number 
              of bonds then the tool may be far less rigid than the solid crystalline 
              tool created by Method A, and thus may be incapable of transmitting 
              the full range of magnitudes and directions of forces that may be 
              required in mechanosynthetic operations. Finally, if the tooltip 
              molecule is bonded to the diamond shard probe through bonds in various 
              numbers and different crystallographic positions, then the position, 
              vibrations, and other important characteristics of the tool will 
              be far less predictable than the tool created by Method A, and the 
              positional uncertainty of dimer placement may be much greater, possibly 
              unacceptably high for many applications, even if the tool is operated 
              at LN<sub>2</sub> or lower temperatures. Nevertheless, Method B 
              is a considerably easier process from an experimental standpoint 
              and so it may be possible to manufacture early, though less capable, 
              mechanosynthetic tools in this manner.</p>

<h2><a name="2.4"></a><a name="Step4"></a>2.4 STEP 4: Separate Finished 
              Tool from Deposition Surface</h2>
<p><u><a name="p111"></a><a href="#Step4">STEP 4</a></u>. Mechanically 
              grasp and break away the diamond crystal-handled tool from the deposition 
              surface, in vacuo. The covalent bond between the tooltip (through 
              the C<sub>2</sub> dimer) and the surface will mechanically break 
              (<a href="#Table8">Table 8</a>), yielding either a tool with a naked 
              carbon dimer attached (i.e., a charged, active mechanosynthetic 
              tool; <a href="#Figure17A">Figure 17A</a>) or a tool with no dimer 
              attached (i.e., a &#8220;discharged&#8221; tool needing recharge, 
              e.g., with acetylene; <a href="#Figure17B">Figure 17B</a>). Ideally, 
              handle diamond near the tooltip forms only weak van der Waals bonds 
              to the deposition surface, so tool breakaway produces few or no 
              unwanted dangling bonds near the active tip. If deemed necessary, 
              each tool can be further <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>d or shaped via laser-, e-beam-, 
              or ion-beam-ablation to provide any desired aspect ratio for the 
              finished tool, or to provide any necessary larger-scale features 
              on the handle surface such as slots, grooves, or ridges, prior to 
              separation of the tool from the surface. This toolbuilding process 
              should work for any carbon dimer deposition tooltip of similar type, 
              as long as the capping group and the deposition surface are judiciously 
              chosen for each case. Note also that the discharged dimer deposition 
              tool can often be employed as a dimer removal tool [<a href="#R38">38</a>], 
              at least in the case of isolated dimers on a mechanosynthetic workpiece, 
              permitting limited rework capability during subsequent mechanosynthetic 
              operations using the tools produced by the present invention.</p>

              or handle structure during storage, but at a temperature low enough 
              to avoid significant dehydrogenation of the diamond handle crystal. 
              Hydrogen desorption becomes measurable at 800-1100 K for the C(111) 
              diamond surface [<a href="#R226">226</a>], 1400 K for the C(110)

<p><a name="p113"></a>The minimum force required to break a C-C bond

              as ~4.4 nN and ~4.0 nN for a C-Si bond, and the threshold stress 
              for breaking two C-C bonds &#8220;mechanically constrained to cleave 
              in a concerted process&#8221; is ~6 nN per bond [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. 
              Hence the force required to simultaneously break both of the bonds 
              between the two tooltip dimer carbon atoms and the two deposition 
              surface atoms to which they are attached, during tool separation

              However, a much larger van der Waals attraction may exist between 
              the diamond tool handle crystal and the deposition surface. For

              attractive force [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R93">93</a>] 
              of F ~ HA/12ps<sup>3</sup> ~ 650,000 nN. Even if the contact <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> 
              is only 100 nm<sup>2</sup> the attractive force is still F ~ 65 
              nN, an order of magnitude larger than the force required to break 
              each of the two covalent bonds between deposition surface and C<sub>2</sub> 
              dimer. The separation force required to snap the finished tool free 
              from the deposition surface, assuming no rogue covalent bonds, is 
              therefore on the order of 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> nN. For 
              comparison, the force of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> on a 1 'm<sup>3</sup> diamond crystal 
              is ~0.00003 nN and the force from a 10,000-g shock impact acceleration 
              (e.g., dropping object on concrete floor) produces a lateral accelerative 
              force of only 0.3 nN.</p>
<p><a name="p114"></a>Additionally, the flexural strength of diamond 
              is 23 times greater than that of silicon, permitting much greater 
              forces to be applied to the tool handle element without breakage; 
              if the diamond handle crystal should contact the substrate which 
              it overhangs, its low coefficient of static friction ensures that 
              the diamond crystal will not adhere to the substrate [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. 
              Note that in one combustion CVD experiment with adamantane-seeded 
              diamond growth on Mo (a carbide-forming surface; <a href="#Table7">Table 
              7</a>) [<a href="#R181">181</a>], it was observed that &#8220;the 
              diamond crystals show a low adhesion on the molybdenum substrate.&#8221; 
              Differential thermal expansion during post-CVD cooling causes the 
              built tool and the deposition surface to shrink differently, creating 
              stresses and possibly prematurely breaking off the tool; a similar 
              technique allows a grown diamond film to separate as an integral 
              diamond sheet on cooling.</p>
<p><a name="p115"></a>The need to securely grip and apply forces against 
              mechanical resistance during the tool separation process, while 
              retaining precise positional <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in all coordinate and rotational 
              axes, imposes specific operational requirements for the gripper 
              and manipulator system. Since the bondlength between C<sub>2</sub> 
              dimer and deposition surface is ~1.5 ', and since these bonds cannot 
              tolerate excessive stretching before breaking, the manipulator system 
              should have a repeatable positioning resolution of at least DR<sub>min</sub> 
              ~ 2 '. Subsequent mechanosynthetic operations on diamond surfaces 
              will likely require repeatable positional accuracies of at least 
              0.5 ', and in some cases as little as 0.2 ' [<a href="#R38">38</a>, 
              <a href="#R235">235</a>], or about tenfold better than for mere 
              tool separation alone. Since handle crystals are of slightly different 
              size, shape, and orientation, it is also important to avoid excessively 
              rotating the handle as it is being grasped in preparation for tool 
              separation from the deposition surface. A handle crystal of radius 
              R<sub>handle</sub> = 1 mm and a minimum allowable displacement of 
              DR<sub>min</sub> = 2 ' implies a minimum allowable rotation of Dq<sub>min</sub> 
              = sin-1(DR<sub>min</sub>/R<sub>handle</sub>) ~ 200 'rad, or 20 'rad 
              for mechanosynthesis operations where DR = 0.2 '. A further requirement 
              is the ability of the manipulator to apply incremental forces along 
              various translational or rotational vectors of DF<sub>min</sub> 
              = 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> nN.</p>
<p><a name="p116"></a>The <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> S100 Nanomanipulator [<a href="#R229">229</a>] 
              achieves a rotational accuracy of Dq<sub>S100</sub> = 2 'rad &lt;&lt; 
              Dq<sub>min</sub> = 20-200 'rad, as required. The S100 grippers provide 
              a maximum gripping force of 550,000 nN ~ DF<sub>min</sub>, which 
              should be adequate in most cases. However, the repeatable positional 
              accuracy of the S100 is only 50 ', or 25 times coarser than the 
              ~2 ' required for controlled tool separation and ~100-250 times 
              coarser than the 0.2-0.5 ' required for accurate mechanosynthesis 
              [<a href="#R235">235</a>]. The Klocke <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a>nik Nanomanipulator 
              claims 20 ' step sizes and 10 ' positional accuracy without backlash 
              [<a href="#R230">230</a>], still not quite good enough. Nevertheless, 
              in a somewhat different <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> scanning with AFM tips may be undertaken 
              with the ~0.1 ' accuracy that would be required during room temperature 
              mechanosynthesis operations. By premeasuring the exact positions 
              of all viable tooltip molecules attached to the deposition surface, 
              and then carefully tracking all positional and rotational <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s 
              that are subsequently applied to the tool, the exact 3D spatial 
              position of the active tool dimer may be continuously estimated 
              with sufficient accuracy.</p>
<p><a name="p117"></a>Once the completed mechanosynthetic tool has 
              been detached from the deposition surface, the exposed C<sub>2</sub> 
              dimer radical is extremely chemically active. According to an AM1 
              simulation, an activated DCB6-Ge tooltip is energetically preferred 
              to combine with incident O<sub>2</sub> molecules by 6.7 eV and with 
              incident N<sub>2</sub> molecules by 2.8 eV, the principal constituents 
              of air, the most likely environmental contaminant. Since any laboratory 
              vacuum is imperfect, stray atoms, ions, and molecules will populate 
              the vacuum chamber at some low concentration and will eventually 
              impinge upon an unused active tooltip, reacting with it and rendering 
              it useless for further mechanosynthetic work.</p>
<p><a name="p118"></a>Using the standard formula for molecular incident

              = 760 P<sub>atm</sub> in torr and rearranging terms, then P<sub>torr</sub>

              kg/mole, the two most likely contaminant molecules from the ambient 
              environment. To ensure a mean tooltip lifetime of t<sub>tool</sub>

              torr for N<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>torr</sub> = 1.3 x 10<sup>-8</sup> 
              torr for O<sub>2</sub>. Ultrahigh vacuums (UHV) of 10<sup>-7</sup>-10<sup>-10</sup> 
              torr have been commonly accessible experimentally for many decades 
              [<a href="#R232">232</a>], and vacuums as high as 10<sup>-15</sup> 
              torr have been created in the laboratory [<a href="#R233">233</a>]. 
              Note that a vacuum of 10<sup>-9</sup> torr inside an enclosed 10,000 
              cubic micron box contains, on average, far less than one contaminant 
              molecule &#8211; usually making, in effect, a perfect vacuum and 
              allowing, in principle, an unrestricted tooltip lifetime.</p>
