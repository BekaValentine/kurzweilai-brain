<br><blockquote>One of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this, that we have seen our atoms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>- KARL K. DARROW, The <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">Renaissance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a></blockquote>
<p>WE WILL USE molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to bring health because the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body is made of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. The ill, the old, and the injured all suffer from mis-arranged patterns of atoms, whether mis-arranged by invading viruses, passing <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, or swerving cars. <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a>s able to rearrange atoms will be able to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> them right. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will bring a fundamental breakthrough in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Physicians now rely chiefly on surgery and drugs to treat illness. Surgeons have advanced from stitching wounds and amputating limbs to repairing hearts and re-attaching limbs. Using microscopes and fine tools, they join delicate blood vessels and nerves. Yet even the best micro-surgeon cannot cut and stitch finer tissue structures. Modern scalpels and sutures are simply too coarse for repairing capillaries, cells, and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. Consider "delicate" surgery from a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s perspective: a huge blade sweeps down, chopping blindly past and through the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of a crowd of cells, slaughtering thousands. Later, a great obelisk plunges through the divided crowd, dragging a cable as wide as a freight train behind it to rope the crowd together again. From a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s perspective, even the most delicate surgery, performed with exquisite knives and great skill, is still a butcher job. Only the ability of cells to abandon their dead, regroup, and multiply makes healing possible.</p>
<p>&#160;Yet as many paralyzed accident victims know too well, not all tissues heal.</p>
<p>&#160;Drug therapy, unlike surgery, deals with the finest structures in cells. Drug <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are simple molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. Many affect specific <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in cells. Morphine <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, for example, bind to certain receptor <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cells, affecting the neural impulses that signal pain. Insulin, beta blockers, and other drugs fit other receptors. But drug <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s work without direction. Once dumped into the body, they tumble and bump around in solution haphazardly until they bump a target <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>, fit, and stick, affecting its function.</p>
<p>&#160;Surgeons can see problems and plan <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s, but they wield crude tools; drug <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s affect tissues at the molecular level, but they are too simple to <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, plan, and act. But molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s directed by nanocomputers will offer physicians another choice. They will combine sensors, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, and molecular tools to form <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to examine and repair the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of individual cells. They will bring surgical control to the molecular domain. &#160;</p>
<p>These advanced molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will be years in arriving, but <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers motivated by medical needs are already studying molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. The best drugs affect specific molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in specific ways. Penicillin, for example, kills certain <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> by jamming the nanomachinery they use to build their <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> walls, yet it has little effect on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists study molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s both to learn how to build them and to learn how to wreck them. Around the world (and especially the Third World) a disgusting variety of viruses, <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, protozoa, fungi, and worms parasitize <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> flesh. Like penicillin, safe, effective drugs for these diseases would jam the parasite's molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry while leaving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry unharmed. Dr. Seymour Cohen, professor of pharmacological <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> at SUNY (Stony Brook, New York), argues that biochemists should <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically study the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of these parasites. Once biochemists have determined the shape and function of a vital <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, they then could often design a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> shaped to jam it and ruin it. Such drugs could free humanity from such ancient horrors as schistosomiasis and leprosy, and from new ones such as AIDS.</p>
<p>&#160;Drug companies are already redesigning <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s based on <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how they work. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers at Upjohn Company have designed and made modified <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s of vasopressin, a hormone that consists of a short chain of amino acids. Vasopressin increases the work done by the heart and decreases the rate at which the kidneys produce urine; this increases blood pressure. The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers designed modified vasopressin <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that affected receptor <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the kidney more than those in the heart, giving them more specific and controllable medical effects. More recently, they designed a modified vasopressin <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> that binds to the kidney's receptor <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s without direct effect, thus blocking and <i>inhibiting</i> the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of natural vasopressin.</p>
<p>&#160;Medical needs will push this work forward, encouraging <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers to take further steps toward <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> design and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Medical, <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>, and economic pressures all push us in the same direction. Even before the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will bring impressive advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>; trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> guarantee it. Still, these advances will generally be piecemeal and hard to predict, each exploiting some detail of biochemistry. Later, when we apply <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, we will gain broader abilities that are easier to foresee.</p>
<p>&#160;To understand these abilities, consider cells and their self-repair mechanisms. In the cells of your body, natural radiation and noxious chemicals split <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, producing reactive molecular fragments. These can misbond to other <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in a process called cross-linking. As bullets and blobs of glue would damage a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, so radiation and reactive fragments damage cells, both breaking molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and gumming them up. &#160;</p>
<p>If your cells could not repair themselves, damage would rapidly kill them or make them run amok by damaging their control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. But <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has favored organisms with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry able to do something about this problem. The self-replicating factory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> sketched in Chapter 4 repaired itself by replacing damaged parts; cells do the same. So long as a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> remains intact, it can make error-free tapes that direct ribosomes to assemble new <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Unfortunately for us, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> itself becomes damaged, resulting in mutations. Repair enzymes compensate somewhat by detecting and repairing certain kinds of damage to <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. These repairs help cells survive, but existing repair mechanisms are too simple to correct all problems, either in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> or elsewhere. Errors mount, contributing to the aging and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of cells - and of people.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, Mind, and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</h1><p>Does it make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to describe cells as "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry," whether self-repairing or not? Since we are made of cells, this might seem to reduce <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings to "mere <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s," conflicting with a holistic understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;But a dictionary definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/holism_entry.html">holism</a> is "the theory that reality is made up of organic or unified wholes that are greater than the simple sum of their parts." This certainly applies to people: one simpler sum of our parts would resemble hamburger, lacking both mind and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body includes some ten thousand billion <i>billion</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> parts, and no <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> so complex deserves the label - mere." Any brief description of so complex a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> cannot avoid being grossly incomplete, yet at the cellular level a description in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">Molecule</a>s have simple moving parts, and many act like familiar types of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. Cells considered as a whole may seem less mechanical, yet biologists find it useful to describe them in terms of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists have unraveled what were once the central mysteries of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and have begun to fill in the details. They have traced how molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s break food <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s into their building blocks and then reassemble these parts to build and renew tissue. Many details of the structure of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells remain unknown (single cells have billions of large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s of thousands of different kinds), but biochemists have mapped every part of some viruses. Biochemical laboratories often sport a large wall chart showing how the chief molecular building blocks flow through <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. Biochemists understand much of the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in detail, and what they don't understand seems to operate on the same principles. The mystery of heredity has become the industry of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Even <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>nic development and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> are being explained in terms of changes in biochemistry and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structure.</p>
<p>&#160;In recent decades, the very quality of our remaining ignorance has changed. Once, biologists looked at the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and asked, "How can this be?" But today they understand the general principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and when they study a specific living process they commonly ask, "Of the many ways this could be, which has <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> chosen?" In many instances their studies have narrowed the competing explanations to a field of one. Certain <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes - the coordination of cells to form growing <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> brains, and reacting <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>s - still present a real challenge to the imagination. Yet this is not because of some deep mystery about how their parts work, but because of the immense <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of how their many parts interact to form a whole.</p>
<p>&#160;Cells obey the same natural laws that describe the rest of the world. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the right molecular environment will work whether they remain in a functioning <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> or whether the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> was ground up and washed away days before. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s know nothing of "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>."</p>
<p>&#160;Biologists - when they bother - sometimes define <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as the ability to grow, replicate, and respond to stimuli. But by this standard, a mindless <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of replicating factories might qualify as <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, while a conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> modeled on the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> might not. Are viruses alive, or are they "merely" fancy molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s? No experiment can tell, because <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> draws no line between living and nonliving. Biologists who work with viruses instead ask about viability: "Will this <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> function, if given a chance?" The labels of "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>" in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> depend on medical capabilities: physicians ask, "Will this patient function, if we do our best?" Physicians once declared patients dead when the heart stopped; they now declare patients dead when they despair of restoring <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> activity. Advances in cardiac <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> changed the definition once; advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> will change it again. &#160;</p>
<p>Just as some people feel uncomfortable with the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, so some feel uncomfortable with the idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s underlie our own <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. The word "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>" again seems to conjure up the wrong image, a picture of gross, clanking metal, rather than signals flickering through a shifting weave of neural fibers, through a living tapestry more intricate than the mind it embodies can fully comprehend. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s really <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are of molecular size, smaller than the finest fibers.</p>
<p>&#160;A whole need not resemble its parts. A solid lump scarcely resembles a dancing fountain, yet a collection of solid, lumpy <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s forms fluid water. In a similar way, billions of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s make up neural fibers and <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s, thousands of fibers and <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s make up a neural <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, billions of neural cells make up the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself embodies the fluidity of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;To say that the mind is "just molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s" is like saying that the Mona Lisa is "just dabs of paint." Such statements confuse the parts with the whole, and confuse <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> with the pattern it embodies. We are no less <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> for being made of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p><h1>From Drugs to <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</h1><p>Being made of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, and having a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> concern for our health, we will apply molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Biologists already use antibodies to tag <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, enzymes to cut and splice <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, and viral syringes (like the T4 phage) to inject edited <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, they will use <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>-built nanomachines to probe and modify cells.</p>
<p>&#160;With tools like disassemblers, biologists will be able to study <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures in ultimate, molecular detail. They then will catalog the hundreds of thousands of kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the body and map the structure of the hundreds of kinds of cells. Much as <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers might compile a parts list and make <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering drawings for an automobile, so biologists will describe the parts and structures of healthy tissue. By that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, they will be aided by sophisticated technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Physicians aim to make tissues healthy, but with drugs and surgery they can only encourage tissues to repair themselves. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will allow more direct repairs, bringing a new era in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;To repair a car, a mechanic first reaches the faulty assembly, then identifies and removes the bad parts, and finally rebuilds or replaces them. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair will involve the same <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> tasks - tasks that living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s already prove possible.</p>
<p>&#160;<b><a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a></b>. White blood cells leave the bloodstream and move through tissue, and viruses enter cells. Biologists even poke needles into cells without killing them. These examples show that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can reach and enter cells.</p>
<p>&#160;<b>Recognition</b>. Antibodies and the tail fibers of the T4 phage - and indeed, all specific biochemical interactions - show that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can recognize other <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s by touch.</p>
<p>&#160;<b>Disassembly</b>. Digestive enzymes (and other, fiercer chemicals) show that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can disassemble damaged <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. &#160;</p>
<p>
<b>Rebuilding</b>. Replicating cells show that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can build or rebuild every <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> found in a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Reassembly</b>. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> also shows that separated <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s can be put back together again. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of the T4 phage, for example, self-assembles from solution, apparently aided by a single enzyme. Replicating cells show that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can assemble every <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> found in a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Thus, <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> demonstrates all the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> operations that are needed to perform molecular-level repairs on cells. What is more, as I described in Chapter 1, <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s based on nanomachines will generally be more compact and capable than those found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Natural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s show us only lower bounds to the possible, in <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair as in everything else.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</h1><p>In short, with molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> we will compile complete, molecular-level descriptions of healthy tissue, and we will build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s able to enter cells and to <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> and modify their structures. &#160;</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be comparable in size to <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> and viruses, but their more-compact parts will allow them to be more complex. They will travel through tissue as white blood cells do, and enter cells as viruses do - or they could open and close <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> membranes with a surgeon's care. Inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, a repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will first size up the situation by examining the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s and activity, and then take <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Early <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be highly specialized, able to recognize and correct only a single type of molecular disorder, such as an enzyme deficiency or a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> damage. Later <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (but not much later, with advanced technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s doing the design work) will be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med with more general abilities.</p>
<p>&#160;Complex repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will need nanocomputers to guide them. A micron-wide mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> like that described in Chapter 1 will fit in 1/1000 of the volume of a typical <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, yet will hold more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> than does the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. In a repair <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, such <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will direct smaller, simpler <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, which will in turn direct <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to examine, take apart, and rebuild damaged molecular structures.</p>
<p>&#160;By working along <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> and structure by structure, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to repair whole cells. By working along <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and tissue by tissue, they (aided by larger <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, where need be) will be able to repair whole organs. By working through a person organ by organ, they will restore health. Because molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to build <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and cells from scratch, they will be able to repair even cells damaged to the point of complete inactivity. Thus, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will bring a fundamental breakthrough: they will free <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> from reliance on self-repair as the only path to healing. &#160;</p>
<p>To visualize an advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, imagine it - and a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> - enlarged until atoms are the size of small marbles. On this scale, the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s smallest tools have tips about the size of your fingertips; a medium-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, like hemoglobin, is the size of a typewriter; and a ribosome is the size of a washing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. A single repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> contains a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> the size of a small truck, along with many sensors of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> size, several manipulators of ribosome size, and provisions for <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and motive power. A total volume ten meters across, the size of a three-story house, holds all these parts and more. With parts the size of marbles packing this volume, the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can do complex things.</p>
<p>&#160;But this repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> does not work alone. It, like its many siblings, is connected to a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> by means of mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> links the diameter of your arm. On this scale, a cubic-micron <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a large <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> fills a volume thirty stories high and as wide as a football field. The repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s pass it <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, and it passes back general instructions. Objects so large and complex are still small enough: on this scale, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> itself is a kilometer across, holding one thousand times the volume of a cubic-micron <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, or a million times the volume of a single repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Cells are spacious. &#160;</p>
<p>Will such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s be able to do everything necessary to repair cells? Existing molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s demonstrate the ability to travel through tissue, enter cells, recognize molecular structures, and so forth, but other requirements are also important. Will repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s work fast enough? If they do, will they waste so much power that the patient will roast? &#160;</p>
<p>The most extensive repairs cannot require <i>vastly</i> more work than building a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> from scratch. Yet molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry working within a cellular volume routinely does just that, building a new <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in tens of minutes (in <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>) to a few hours (in <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s). This indicates that repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry occupying a few percent of a cells volume will be able to complete even extensive repairs in a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> - days or weeks at most. Cells can spare this much room. Even <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cells can still function when an inert waste called lipofuscin (apparently a product of molecular damage) fills over ten percent of their volume.</p>
<p>&#160;Powering repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will be easy: cells naturally contain chemicals that power nanomachinery. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> also shows that repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can be cooled: the cells in your body rework themselves steadily, and young <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s grow swiftly without cooking themselves. Handling heat from a similar level of activity by repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be no sweat - or at least not too much sweat, if a week of sweating is the price of health. &#160;</p>
<p>All these comparisons of repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to existing <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mechanisms raise the question of whether repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to <i>improve</i> on <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> repair provides a clear-cut illustration.</p>
<p>&#160;Just as an illiterate "book-repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>" could recognize and repair a torn page, so a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s repair enzymes can recognize and repair breaks and cross-links in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. Correcting misspellings (or mutations), though, would require an ability to read. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> lacks such repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but they will be easy to build. Imagine three identical <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, each with the same sequence of <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s. Now imagine each strand mutated to change a few scattered <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s. Each strand still seems normal, taken by itself. Nonetheless, a repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could compare each strand to the others, one segment at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and could note when a <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> failed to match its mates. Changing the odd <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> to match the other two will then repair the damage.</p>
<p>&#160;This method will fail if two strands mutate in the same spot. Imagine that the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> of three <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells has been heavily damaged - after thousands of mutations, each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> has had one in every million <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s changed. The chance of our three-strand correction procedure failing at any given spot is then about one in a million million. But compare five strands at once, and the odds become about one in a million million million, and so on. A <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that compares many strands will make the chance of an uncorrectable error effectively nil.</p>
<p>&#160;In practice, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will compare <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from several cells, make corrected copies, and use these as standards for proofreading and repairing <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> throughout a tissue. By comparing several strands, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will dramatically improve on <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>'s repair enzymes.</p>
<p>&#160;Other repairs will require different <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about healthy cells and about how a particular damaged <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> differs from the norm. Antibodies identify <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s by touch, and properly chosen antibodies can generally distinguish any two <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s by their differing shapes and surface properties. Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will identify <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in a similar way. With a suitable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> base, they will be able to identify <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s by reading their amino acid sequences.</p>
<p>&#160;Consider a complex and capable repair <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. A volume of two cubic microns - about 2/1000 of the volume of a typical <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> - will be enough to hold a central <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> base <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Swiftly identify any of the hundred thousand or so different <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s by examining a short amino acid sequence.</li>
<li>2. Identify all the other complex <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s normally found in cells.</li>
<li>3. Record the type and position of every large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the smaller repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s (of perhaps thousands in a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>) will include a less capable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Each of these <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will be able to perform over a thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al steps in the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that a typical enzyme takes to change a single molecular bond, so the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> possible seems more than adequate. Because each <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will be in <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> with a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and the central <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> base, the available <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> seems adequate. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will have both the molecular tools they need and "brains" enough to decide how to use them. &#160;</p>
<p>Such sophistication will be overkill (overcure?) for many health problems. <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a>s that merely recognize and destroy a specific kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, for example, will be enough to cure a <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>. Placing a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> in every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> may seem like slicing butter with a chain saw, but having a chain saw available does provide assurance that even hard butter can be sliced. It seems better to show too much than too little, if one aims to describe the limits of the possible in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>.</p><h1>Some Cures</h1><p>The simplest medical applications of nanomachines will involve not repair but selective destruction. <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">Cancer</a>s provide one example; infectious diseases provide another. The goal is simple: one need only recognize and destroy the dangerous replicators, whether they are <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells, viruses, or worms. Similarly, abnormal <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>s and deposits on arterial walls cause much heart disease; <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that recognize, break down, and dispose of them will clear arteries for more normal blood flow. Selective destruction will also cure diseases such as herpes in which a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> splices its genes into the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> of a host <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. A repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> will enter the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, read its <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, and remove the addition that spells "herpes."</p>
<p>&#160;Repairing damaged, cross-linked <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s will also be fairly straightforward. Faced with a damaged, cross-linked <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will first identify it by examining short amino acid sequences, then look up its correct structure in a <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> base. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will then compare the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> to this blueprint, one amino acid at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Like a proofreader finding misspellings and strange characters (char#cters), it will find any changed amino acids or improper cross-links. By correcting these flaws, it will leave a normal <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, ready to do the work of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. &#160;</p>
<p>Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will also aid healing. After a heart attack, scar tissue replaces dead muscle. Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will stimulate the heart to grow fresh muscle by resetting cellular control mechanisms. By removing scar tissue and guiding fresh <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, they will direct the healing of the heart.</p>
<p>&#160;This list could continue through problem after problem (Heavy metal poisoning? - Find and remove the metal atoms) but the conclusion is easy to summarize. Physical disorders stem from mis-arranged atoms; repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to return them to working <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, restoring the body to health. Rather than compiling an endless list of curable diseases (from arthritis, bursitis, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, and dengue to yellow fever and zinc chills and back again), it makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to look for the limits to what <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can do. Limits do exist.</p>
<p>&#160;Consider stroke, as one example of a problem that damages the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Prevention will be straightforward: Is a blood vessel in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> weakening, bulging, and apt to burst? Then pull it back into shape and guide the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of reinforcing fibers. Does abnormal clotting threaten to block circulation? Then dissolve the clots and normalize the blood and blood-vessel linings to prevent a recurrence. Moderate neural damage from stroke will also be repairable: if reduced circulation has impaired function but left <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures intact, then restore circulation and repair the cells, using their structures as a guide in restoring the tissue to its previous state. This will not only restore each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s function, but will preserve the memories and skills embodied in the neural patterns in that part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to regenerate fresh <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> tissue even where damage has obliterated these patterns. But the patient would lose old memories and skills to the extent that they resided in that part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. If unique neural patterns are truly obliterated, then <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could no more restore them than <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> conservators could restore a tapestry from stirred ash. Loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> through obliteration of structure imposes the most important, fundamental limit to the repair of tissue.</p>
<p>&#160;Other tasks are beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s for different <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s - maintaining mental health, for instance. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to correct some problems, of course. Deranged <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> sometimes has biochemical causes, as if the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> were drugging or poisoning itself, and other problems stem from tissue damage. But many problems have little to do with the health of <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells and everything to do with the health of the mind.</p>
<p>&#160;A mind and the tissue of its <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are like a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> and the paper of its book. Spilled ink or flood damage may harm the book, making the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> difficult to read. Book repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could nonetheless restore physical - health" by removing the foreign ink or by drying and repairing the damaged paper fibers. Such treatments would do nothing for the book's <i><a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a></i>, however, which in a real <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> is nonphysical. If the book were a cheap romance with a moldy plot and empty characters, repairs would be needed not on the ink and paper, but on the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>. This would call not for physical repairs, but for more work by the author, perhaps with advice.</p>
<p>&#160;Similarly, removing poisons from the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and repairing its <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> fibers will thin some mental fogs, but not revise the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of the mind. This can be changed by the patient, with effort; we are all authors of our minds. But because minds change themselves by changing their brains, having a healthy <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will aid sound <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> more than quality paper aids sound writing. &#160;</p>
<p>Readers familiar with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s may prefer to think in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could repair a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> while neither understanding nor changing its <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a></p>
<p>&#160;Such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s might stop the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s activity but leave the patterns in <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> intact and ready to work again. In <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with the right kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> (called "nonvolatile"), users do this by simply <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing off the power. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> the job seems more complex, yet there could be medical advantages to inducing a similar state.</p><h1>Anesthesia Plus</h1><p>Physicians already stop and restart <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> by interfering with the chemical activity that underlies the mind. Throughout active <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> process <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. Some disassemble sugars, combine them with <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>, and capture the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> this releases. Some pump salt ions across <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> membranes; others build small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and release them to signal other cells. Such processes make up the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s metabolism, the sum total of its chemical activity. Together with its electrical effects, this metabolic activity underlies the changing patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Surgeons cut people with knives. In the mid-1800s, they learned to use chemicals that interfere with <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> metabolism, blocking conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and preventing patients from objecting so vigorously to being cut. These chemicals are anesthetics. Their <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s freely enter and leave the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, allowing anesthetists to interrupt and restart <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;People have long dreamed of discovering a drug that interferes with the metabolism of the entire body, a drug able to interrupt metabolism completely for hours, days, or years. The result would be a condition of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> (from <i>bio</i>, meaning <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and <i>stasis</i>, meaning a stoppage or a stable state). A method of producing reversible <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> could help astronauts on long <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> voyages to save food and avoid boredom, or it could serve as a kind of one-way <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel. In <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> would provide a deep anesthesia giving physicians more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to work. When emergencies occur far from medical help, a good <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> procedure would provide a sort of universal first-aid treatment: it would stabilize a patient's condition and prevent molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s from running amok and damaging tissues. &#160;</p>
<p>But no one has found a drug able to stop the entire metabolism the way anesthetics stop <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> - that is, in a way that can be reversed by simply washing the drug out of the patient's tissues. Nonetheless, reversible <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> will be possible when repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s become available.</p>
<p>&#160;To see how one approach would work, imagine that the blood stream carries simple molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to tissues, where they enter the cells. There they block the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of metabolism - in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and elsewhere - and tie structures together with stabilizing cross-links. Other molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s then move in, displacing water and packing themselves solidly around the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. These steps stop metabolism and preserve <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures. Because <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be used to reverse this process, it can cause moderate molecular damage and yet do no lasting harm. With metabolism stopped and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures held firmly in place, the patient will rest quietly, dreamless and unchanging, until repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s restore active <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. &#160;</p>
<p>If a patient in this condition were turned over to a present-day physician ignorant of the capabilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, the consequences would likely be grim. Seeing no signs of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, the physician would likely conclude that the patient was dead, and then would make this judgment a reality by "prescribing" an autopsy, followed by burial or burning.</p>
<p>&#160;But our imaginary patient lives in an era when <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> is known to be only an interruption of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, not an end to it. When the patient's contract says "wake me!" (or the repairs are complete, or the flight to the stars is finished), the attending physician begins resuscitation. Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s enter the patient's tissues, removing the packing from around the patient's <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and replacing it with water. They then remove the cross-links, repair any damaged <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s an structures, and restore normal concentrations of salts, blood sugar, <a class="thought" href="entries/atp_entry.html">ATP</a>, and so forth. Finally, they unblock the metabolic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. The interrupted metabolic processes resume, the patient yawns, stretches, sits up, thanks the doctor, checks the date, and walks out the door.</p><h1>From Function To Structure</h1><p>The reversibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> and irreversibility of severe stroke damage help to show how <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will change <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. Today, physicians can only help tissues to heal themselves. Accordingly they must try to preserve the <i>function</i> of tissue. If tissues cannot function, they cannot heal. Worse, unless they are preserved, deterioration follows, ultimately obliterating structure. It is as if a mechanic's tools were able to work only on a running <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Cell repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s change the central requirement from preserving <i>function</i> to preserving <i>structure</i>. As I noted in the discussion of stroke, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to restore <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> function with <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and skills intact only if the distinctive structure of the neural fabric remains intact. <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a> involves preserving neural structure while deliberately blocking function.</p>
<p>&#160;All this is a direct consequence of the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the repairs. Physicians using scalpels and drugs can no more repair cells than someone using only a pickax and a can of oil can repair a fine watch. In contrast, having repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and ordinary nutrients will be like having a watchmaker's tools and an unlimited supply of spare parts. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will change <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> at its foundations.</p><h1>From Treating Disease To Establishing Health</h1><p>Medical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers now study diseases, often seeking ways to prevent or reverse them by blocking a key step in the disease process. The resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> has helped physicians greatly: they now prescribe insulin to compensate for diabetes, anti-hypertensives to prevent stroke, penicillin to cure infections, and so on down an impressive list. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will aid the study of diseases, yet they will make understanding disease far less important. Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will make it more important to understand health.</p>
<p>&#160;The body can be ill in more ways than it can be healthy. Healthy muscle tissue, for example, varies in relatively few ways: it can be stronger or weaker, faster or slower, have this antigen or that one, and so forth. Damaged muscle tissue can vary in all these ways, yet also suffer from any combination of strains, tears, viral infections, parasitic worms, bruises, punctures, poisons, sarcomas, wasting diseases, and congenital abnormalities. Similarly, though <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are woven in as many patterns as there are <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains, individual <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s and dendrites come in a modest range of forms - if they are healthy.</p>
<p>&#160;Once biologists have described normal <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, cells, and tissues, properly <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to cure even unknown diseases. Once <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers describe the range of structures that (for example) a healthy liver may have, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s exploring a malfunctioning liver need only look for differences and correct them. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s ignorant of a new poison and its effects will still recognize it as foreign and remove it. Instead of fighting a million strange diseases, advanced repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will establish a state of health.</p>
<p>&#160;Developing and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will require great effort, <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and skill. Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with broad capabilities seem easier to build than to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Their <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s must contain detailed <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the hundreds of kinds of cells and the hundreds of thousands of kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body. They must be able to map damaged cellular structures and decide how to correct them. How long will such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s take to be developed? Offhand, the state of biochemistry and its present rate of advance might suggest that the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> alone will take centuries to collect. But we must beware of the illusion that advances will arrive in isolation.</p>
<p>&#160;Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will sweep in with a <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> of other technologies. The <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s that build them will first be used to build <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s for analyzing <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures. Even a pessimist might agree that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> biologists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers equipped with these tools could build and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in a hundred years of steady work. A cocksure, far-seeing pessimist might say a thousand years. A really committed nay-sayer might declare that the job would take people a million years. Very well: fast technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s - a millionfold faster than scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers - will then develop advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in a single calendar year.</p><h1>A Disease Called "Aging"</h1><p>Aging is natural, but so were smallpox and our efforts to prevent it. We have conquered smallpox, and it seems that we will conquer aging.</p>
<p>&#160;Longevity has increased during the last century, but chiefly because better sanitation and drugs have reduced <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l illness. The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span has increased little.</p>
<p>&#160;Still, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have made <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward understanding and slowing the aging process. They have identified some of its causes, such as uncontrolled cross-linking. They have devised partial treatments, such as antioxidants and free-radical inhibitors. They have proposed and studied other mechanisms of aging, such as - clocks" in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and changes in the body's hormone balance. In laboratory experiments, special drugs and diets have extended the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span of mice by 25 to 45 percent.</p>
<p>&#160;Such work will continue; as the baby boom generation ages, expect a boom in aging <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. One <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> company, Senetek of Denmark, specializes in aging <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. In April 1985, Eastman Kodak and ICN <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">Pharmaceutical</a>s were reported to have joined in a $45 million venture to produce isoprinosine and other drugs with the potential to extend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span. The results of conventional anti-aging <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> may substantially lengthen <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans - and improve the health of the old - during the next ten to twenty years. How greatly will drugs, surgery, exercise, and diet extend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans? For now, estimates must remain guesswork. Only new scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> can rescue such predictions from the realm of speculation, because they rely on new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and not just new <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering.</p>
<p>&#160;With <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, however, the potential for <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> becomes clear. They will be able to repair cells so long as their distinctive structures remain intact, and will be able to replace cells that have been destroyed. Either way, they will restore health. Aging is fundamentally no different from any other physical disorder; it is no magical effect of calendar dates on a mysterious <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-force. Brittle bones, wrinkled skin, low enzyme activities, slow wound healing, poor <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and the rest all result from damaged molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, chemical imbalances, and mis-arranged structures. By restoring all the cells and tissues of the body to a youthful structure, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will restore youthful health.</p>
<p>&#160;People who survive intact until the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will have the opportunity to regain youthful health and to keep it almost as long as they please. Nothing can make a person (or anything else) last forever, of course, but barring severe accidents, those wishing to do so will live for a long, long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. &#160;</p>
<p>As a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> develops, there comes a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when its principles become clear, and with them many of its consequences. The principles of rocketry were clear in the 1930s, and with them the consequence of spaceflight. Filling in the details involved designing and testing tanks, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, and so forth. By the early 1950s, many details were known. The ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of flying to the Moon had became a goal one could plan for.</p>
<p>&#160;The principles of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry are already clear, and with them the consequence of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Filling in the details will involve designing molecular tools, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and so forth, but many details of existing molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are known today. The ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of achieving health and long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has become a goal one can plan for.</p>
<p>&#160;Medical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is leading us, step by step, along a path toward molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. The global competition to make better materials, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, and biochemical tools is pushing us in the same direction. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will take years to develop, but they lie straight ahead.</p>
<p>&#160;They will bring many abilities, both for good and for ill. A moment's <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> replicators with abilities like those of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s is enough to turn up nauseating possibilities. Later I will describe how we might avoid such horrors, but it first seems wise to consider the alleged benefits of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Is their <i>apparent</i> good <i>really</i> good? How might long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> affect the world?</p>
