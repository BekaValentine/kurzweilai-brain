<div class="TeaserText">Imaginative new ideas for using space to protect civilization against existential risks, such as killer asteroids, nuclear war, and global terrorism, are in the works. The public increasingly sees NASA as irrelevant; we need a revitalized new vision of space, says a new breed of space activists. Gerard O'Neill would be proud.</div>

<br>Backing up <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>'s collective 
            hard drive&#8212;its recorded archive&#8212;on the Moon and creating 
            a self-sufficient colony there precisely so it can act as a lifeboat 
            in case a calamity strikes Earth: that's the rationale for a new book 
            from Forge Books, <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154434/http://www.amazon.com/Survival-Imperative-Using-Protect-Earth/dp/0765311143" target="_blank">The 
            Survival Imperative: Using Space to Protect Earth</a></i>, according 
            to author William E. Burrows. 
            <p>"That should be the overarching <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for moving there, not 
              to mine resources or for the sake of a grand adventure. And the 
              move outward must start with the Moon, not Mars. The Moon is three 
              or four days away, not a year, so it makes logistical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> and 
              is cheaper. And if there's an accident on the Moon, help or a safe 
              haven are likewise four days away. Finally, the lunar colony ought 
              to be <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>'s overriding (but not only) mission, especially since 
              it walked off a cliff after Apollo. That's what the book is about. 
              It's my gift to the home <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>."</p>
<p>Burrows presents a dramatic scenario of a killer-asteroid impact

<p>"Planetary defense should be conducted, not as a major program 
              within the space agency, but as the agency's highly focused, overarching, 
              mission.... The core mission, in its totality, would send humans 
              and robots to space for mutually supportive <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s specifically 
              designed to protect the planet. That is to say, NASA, its collective 
              foreign counterparts, and other cooperating U.S. agencies, should 
              assume the role of Earth's guardians." (From Chapter 8, The 
              Guardians, which can be read <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154434/http://lifeboat.com/ex/using.space.to.protect.earth" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

              "One or more generations of Americans does not see a reason 
              for spending a dime on space," he says. "One or more generations 
              of Americans imprinted as kids on something very different than 
              we did. They imprinted on spaceship Earth, on the view that this 
              is a planet with dwindling resources and that we have sinned against

              Werner Von Braun, Willy Ley, Chesley Bonestell, and Robert Heinlein 
              accomplished in the early 1950s with their TV show (Tom Corbett 
              Space Cadet), their film (Destination Moon), their magazine articles, 
              and their books. They planted the image of an as-yet-unborn space

<p>"I'd like to propose an NFL-style press campaign to elevate 
              the visibility of the space efforts of the non-NASA players and 
              to raise the level of public aspiration by inspiring it with the 
              immediacy of a new frontier we can open wide in our lifetime, a 
              new frontier that can dramatically upscale the lives of our children 
              and of their children after them.</p>
<p>"As a scientist of mass behavior who did his fieldwork by 
              founding the leading public relations firm in the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> industry, 
              I have a sense of a <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> that can achieve this aim. Each of

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This is a monumental task.  Creating a completely, indefinitely (which is what you would need to satisfy the purposes described) self-sufficient colony is a radically different task than just creating a moon base (and we haven't even done that yet).
<br>
<br>
What does such a base do when it needs a part for a worn out machine?  Sure, you can have a machine shop for simple structural parts.  What about electronics?  Is this moon base going to be able to make everything from resistors to CPUs?  A chip fab isn't exactly something you whip up on the moon.  Same goes for the ability to create medicines and advanced materials.  Finally, what do you do when you run out of raw materials?  Are we also going to set up mining plants on the moon for all the miscellaneous elements that will be needed for manufacturing?  Do they even all exist in reasonable quantities?
<br>
<br>
I doubt that this could be done with existing technology.  Of course, that doesn't mean that it should not be attempted -- I'm sure we would learn a huge amount just from attempting the endeavor.  But, I think people should realize the true nature of project.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>

<br>
<br>
Miniturisation may come before that, but it should be attempted because of the psychological reasons.
<br>
<br>
The colonisation of the planets is just a matter of time.

But many projects are incited with a person with a vision (often deluded) who's passion &amp; enthisiasm draws people.

<br>
<br>
No offence taken.  Thanks for your good points.
<br>
<br>
Rocket engineer, Robert Zubrin, says competition is better than collaboration. See his books, CASE FOR MARS, ENTERING SPACE, ENERGY VICTORY.
<br>
<br>
He rightfully states that manned spaceflight has been dead since the Soviets and US were competing for space.  Also, the ITER project, being based on international "cooperation" rather than competition, is taking forever to make even relatively small decisions.
<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Zubrin.  Homo Sapiens is an ill-motivated creature.  He seeks pleasure and profit and would rather sit on a planet doing nothing unless his life is threatened or he is in competition out of fear.(1)  
<br>
<br>
Until people stop sitting on their asses watching movies/media, drinking beer and screwing, nothing much is going to be happening.
<br>
<br>
Read ENTERING SPACE where Zubrin says we need "frontier shock" to prevent stagnation.  The lack of this and competition, combined with the above mind-numbing technologies and past times, are sure to keep us locked to a planet.

In fact, I would think that, logically, once we are able to travel to the moon in a cost effective manner, move the data in a cost effective manner, store it in a permanent fashion, and so forth, wouldn't we necessarily have advanced to the point that such a repository would then be superfluous?

Especially in a catastrophic situation when no help or re-supply ship from Earth is forthcoming. Therefore, although it's easier to get to the Moon, it should be "easier" (if this word can even be used in the context) to survive on Mars with its trace of an atmosphere, ice-trapped water and even a larges mass of it will make adaptation somewhat more bearable.

It sort of does makes sense: If you are going one way only you can bring more stuff needed to stay. Besides, with a catastrophic situation back here on Earth the incentives for the one-way travelers that are currently the weakest point of the proposal will suddenly become so much more attractive!</p></td>

I'm not sure how true the theory is, but it goes like this: upon the formation of the planets and the Earth, a hot "piece" of the Earth broke off and became the moon... therefore, the same elements should be present on the moon that are on Earth. 
<br>
<br>
also, I think with regard to solid planetoids, the elemental make up should be universal... if I had to make an educated guess, obviously with different ratios. 
<br>
<br>
the moon is also quite a large planetoid that we may pollute and plunder all we want. besides, think of the cost reductions of launching a space vessel off the moon due to less gravitational force...</p></td>

<br>
<br>
For example, if this swine flu gets out of hand, a colony on the Moon could survive it provided they had a good quarantine protocol in place for any arriving visitors.
<br>
<br>
You need to protect against the various "goo" scenarios.  Grey goo could certainly get into any kind of underground bunkers, etc.
<br>
<br>
I think it is unlikely a full society of people would live anywhere on Earth, no matter how safe, without having fairly frequent interaction with the general populace.
<br>
<br>
So severe physical isolation is key in any backup civilization.
<br>
<br>
This is similar to protecting computers/data from computer viruses -- certain Defense computers are not even connected to a network, as no amount of vigil can guarantee no malicious success as long as the physical connection is possible.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The main message in this article is not to  base human life in the moon but to turn the moon into a computerized back up copy of humans, in case of existential calamity to extinct human consciousness here on Earth.  I was amazed to learn for the first time today about the CyberRev program by Dr Marthin Rothblat which is quite similar to the Info-Resurrection method I am developing in recent months, and intend to send first to KurzweilAI.net and to Ray Kurzweil the leading future pioneer himself. in my work I  strive to show how a competent "Identity Critical Information", based on the reductionist theories of the self can be captured now for future reanimation. 'Our inclination to create models is culminating in our rapidly growing efforts to create virtual environments and to populate these artificial worlds with virtual humans.' Foreword to Virtual Humans by Ray Kurzweil
<br>
But who will be those first virtual humans?
<br>
'The Info-Resurrection' claim is that they will be real people living today, first simulated as non conscious yet very convincing and vivid 'personalized' AI in the cyberspace, and later when conscious AI will emerge, these simulations of real persons will be the first individual humans living today, completely transformed into artificial brains ' and bodies - with all its implications.
<br>
info-resurrection is a method to survive oneself to the 'transhuman future, the singularity and beyond'  through 'reliable and advanced self identity capture'  to retain ' the critical information regarding the identity and the personality'  as well as possibly retaining one's genotype, for future converging information technologies to reinstantiate that information either as 'info-resurrected' clone of oneself or better off as a human machine merger  - cyborg ' or wholly non biological brain in all its various possible manifestations. 'artificial brains'
<br>
<br>
In other words, info-resurrection will reanimate a clone of yours, but a clone which carry the life experience, personality and the self identity of yourself at your present phase life and better off, transformed to pure artificial life forms enormously more capable than our DNA-based biology.
<br>
The central 'info-resurrection' claim to be defended in this work is that the critical information regarding a person and his identity can be gathered by reliable 'personality capture' procedure available mostly today and can shortly be refined and perfected, thus, future IT ' AI and molecular manufacture ' will reanimate a reliable and very similar duplicate of yours,  to the effect of your survival - in case worst come to worst and the old self didn't made it. Personally I  follow Kurzweil's 'Fantastic Voyage' biological strategy of survival, and sure this is the prime way, just to survive  long enough biologically to live forever, but shouldn't we insure ourselves by having a good back up information copy of ourselves, if this is feasible?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>One question I have about the transfer of one's "identity" or "self" to a "new version" of yourself (cyborg, clone, nonbiological, whatever) is what happens to the original?  For instance, if we are using brain copying methods to get an exact copy at the electrochemical level of my brain and let another entity (my "version 2.0") use that, then there would, in effect, simply be two of me.  I would still exists as my own self, only there would be another "me" in existence as well.  This is easy to grasp.
<br>
<br>
The difficult part comes in the "transition" from simply being me to being me 2.0.  I would imagine that logically, since my "identity" is now stored in me 2.0, there is no need to keep the old version around.  So to external observers, simply "shutting down" the old hardware would okay, since my data is copied over.  But I would not be sharing the experiences of the new "me", so this would (from my own perspective) be the same as dying.  While to the external world, this wouldn't matter because my data still exists, it is not logical to assume that I would "go to sleep" and immediately begin experiencing from my "new" perspective.  Logically, I would just cease to exist from my own point of view.
<br>
<br>
Any ideas on this??

And it doesn't stop their.  Neuron sized microprocessors may someday reside in and replicate our brains to link to other people's brains at the speed of light. This would essentially connect the human race together like the neurons of our brains. We would meld into one living entity.      
<br>
<br>
With this kind of technology we should be able to database the knowledge and skill sets of the world to build or do anything we want.  In other words we should be able to download knowledge and skill sets without the need of schools for learning.  It was science fiction in the movie Matrix when Leo became a ninja master by download. If this becomes possible for us, we can keep a database on the moon for emergencies.  And if a pandemic does wipe out our planet, we can download the skill sets and rebuild.  We can become an Engineer when we need to build a bridge, a rocket, or a mainframe.  We can become specialized in a specific field of science with the wisdom of Einstein, Niels Bohr or James Watson to solve problems.  All this with the ease of a download.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I doubt if we can effectively motivate enough of civilization to establish a back up colony on the moon. Usually throughout history, the biggest motivator to do anything is someone always trying to destroy another. So natural human greed and malice may aid the cause of promoting a moon colony. In the coming years I expect to see a lot of conflict, with the looming oil crisis(see the website for the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) )around 2015 and a myriad of other factors; demand for fossil fuels will be higher than production, causing a shortfall. We are so utterly dependant on fossil fuels; when the oil bust hits us without any alternatives, world-wide economic crisis will ensue followed by war. With oil wealth in the hands tyrannical nations, its only a matter of time before a major city will be attacked with nuclear weapons based upon current conditions.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully soon technological advancement will outpace any dangers presented to us, but becoming more than human will cause much strife of its own. Not everybody is going to play by the rules and powerful tech will be abused. Human advancement is the only option for the social security problem, but this option will most likely be for the rich and powerful.
<br>
<br>
Human physical advancement is the solution for space colonization, due to lethal radiation and gravity sickness, and that means no giant hamster wheels for us. As for the problems of producing tools and other necessities, this will be solved by nano- synthesizers ("NANOFUTURE" by J. Storrs Hall, is a good reading on the subject). Production of fuel and construction materials without synthesizers can be accomplished with microwaving "regolith" (see February 2007 of discover magazine). In my opinion, there are three options for getting people and supplies to the moon. One: build more effective spacecraft that can escape earths orbit fly around in space. Two: a slightly less comfortable ride would is to build a space cannon capable of launching cargo into orbit, but this means that fine china and un-enhanced beings will be PULVERIZED! Three: The space elevator concept.
<br>
<br>
The last ingredient for life beings to flourish throughout the solar system and possibly beyond is the need for HUGE amounts of energy. There are many possible options but to yours truly, the best are highly efficient solar cells and nuclear fusion reactors. The amount of energy hitting the earth daily is 10000 times the amount society uses daily, and covering the moon with solar cells would solve the energy needs of people on the moon. Fusion is a possible solution with potential ("The Fusion Quest" by T. Kenneth Fowler is a good beginner reading for fusion, also www.brian-mcdermott Dotcom is a good fusion resource). Id like to know how advancements in nanotech could solve the fusion dilemma, any feedback would be appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Sorry about writing so much, it's hard to get the whole perspective with only a couple of paragraphs. I'm sure anyone reading this probably knows more about this than I.
<br>
<br>
Remember, were all on the same team, but we just have different ways of playing the game.
<br>

Yours Truly and Happy Hunting

<br>
<br>
To expect a Codex of Earth Civilisation that may be uploaded to the moon not to become corrupted from when the first habitats are buried and when the Codex is needed again by Earth is a fallacy.
<br>
<br>
Succesive generations of Lunar Society will increasingly diverge from Earth civilisation. Lunar inhabitants will reside at the bottom of a much shallower gravity well than Earth and will not be subject to the same seasonal patterns. They will inhabit a rarefied biota not only different from our own but more fundamentaly, one that is actively and scrupulously maintained by themselves. Figuring prominently in the minds of lunar inhabitants will be the status of each and every system that second by second regulates and ultimately ensures their survival. We are only now beginning to think green they have no option but to fear the red of a sytems status alert.
<br>
<br>
No more will these people rise to each fresh and new day, look to the blue sky, feel the wind on their faces and thank God for their survival. They will thank themselves. If even moderately successful they will soon grow tired of Earth dwellers and their contempt of the Earths unlimited bounty. Perhaps their contempt will be driven by resentment during a period akin to adolescence when they might regard themselves as a mere outpost, or worse as lepers cast out into the night. But if they endure this initial sense of austerity and isolation will wane.
<br>
<br>
They might well raid the riches of Earths history  , the guardianship of which they have been charged ,and find analogy with a past civilisation at a similar cusp to their own. I quote from Benjamin Franklin 'Advice to a Young Tradesman 
<br>
<br>
"the way to wealth if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends on two words Industry and Frugality"
<br>
<br>
They will see that as once the sea faring Old World of Europe deposited a small band of dissaffected settlers on the shores of an undiscovered continent that posed many hardships in the short term whilst offering great wealth to anyone with neccesary grit and vision, they too have a similar opportunity. 
<br>
<br>
I suspect they would soon look to Earth as an anachronism, a senile grandparent unable or unwilling to make the tough choices that they make every second to ensure their survival. 
<br>
<br>
Now back to our own fate and that day that we need whatever this Lunar colony has held in trust for us. At that time we will be at the bottom not only of a gravity well but also in the depths or so its seems for our lunar progeny of a world view that is simply absurd. 
<br>
<br>
The transmission log may go something like this;
<br>
<br>
Houston:- Send us down our seed banks
<br>
<br>
Luna:- You mean the proprietry terminator clones ones that you sent us or the open source strains that we developed ourselves and that abound in our transhabitats.
<br>
<br>
Houston:- OUR seed banks
<br>
<br>
Luna:- I suspect your patents no longer apply 
<br>
<br>
Houston:- Okay then would you mind realigning the the microwave downlinks on the Phase B Lagrangian L4 solar array. You seem to have irradiated several sections of the midwestern refugee belts.
<br>
<br>
Luna:- The L4 outpost including most of my family have been decimated by tactical kinetic strike by an as of yet, unidentified element of your 'Axis of Evil' 
<br>
<br>
Houston:- Luna, Do we have a problem?

<br>
<br>
While there are metals and huge amounts of oxygen locked up in lunar rock, the moon practically lacks such vital ingredients as nitrates, phosphates, carbonates and hydrates, basically everything you need to sustain life and agriculture (even though there might be some hydrogen in the form of polar water ice).
<br>
<br>
And if you plan to ship it all up there, please note that Moore's Law has nothing to do with energy requirements and thrust-to-weight ratios.
<br>
<br>
Luna is good enough for a giant observatory on the far side, enabling us to spot earthlike planets around Alpha Centauri, and a second utility might include a mining operation, since potentially platinum group metals could be there, but as a self sustaining world next door to Terra, forget about it!</p></td>

Last time I checked nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon were atoms and the only place I'm aware that basic elements heavier than helium can be "assembled" is inside aging and dying stars (helium is produced in main sequence stars by the way).

I'm nevertheless open to suggestions. After all, what do I know, I'm no scientist.

I was just reacting to the starry eyed, overreachiing pie in the sky optimism I was sensing in that article. Nanomanufacturing submolecular matter sounds *very* hypothetical to me, not mentioning that just a molecular nanoreplicator as far as I know still only remains theory.   
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> ....or teraform Luna with their loony nanofactories. </p></center>
<br>
The end result will in any event be only 1/6 Earth gravity. I wouldn't want to be among the muscle antrophied and skeleton deteriorated second generation settlers on such a world, if indeed succesful childbearing will be even possible. The Moon is not a place to spend too much time on for too long. More like, grab potential riches and get out fast (at least for anything but hundred percent cyborgs)!
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Besides, I've always said that I will defend my right to a short, inconsequential, and miserable life TO THE DEATH! So who needs a moon backup? </p></center>
<br>
Correct, who needs it? Speaking of backups on the other hand, humanity ought to go to Mars instead. It's the only place in the solar system which is actually potentially capable of generating a self sufficient branch of human civilization, well, more or less anyway. Besides, if we get lucky with certain factors, we already know how to terraform Mars including short term, although an oxygenated atmosphere will probably take about a thousand years to accomplish.

<br>
*lol* Yeah, okay, guess I can't argue with the last sentence. Nevertheless, we should count ourselves lucky if we manage to save the human species for expansion in our interplanetary and interstellar neighbourhood to begin with (the universe can certainly wait for its redeemer), and the only way to start doing that is to take a long and realistic look at our actual opportunities.  </p></td>

The only problem will be their motivation -- they won't be doing it explicitly to backup civilization.
<br>
<br>
There will probably need to be some sort of government regulation requiring certain repositories of knowledge, genetic banks, etc. to be stored by any offworld colonies.
<br>
<br>
Other than that, you probably do want the guys with money to do their regular capitalist thing and get exploring based on promise of various riches.</p></td>

The difference between those people and us is, the availablilty and ability for the common man to use the technolgy "that hasn't been invented yet" neccesary to do the exploring and colinizing. We are like the people that built the first boats that could cross back and forth between the islands of the mediteranian, but did not have the ability to cross the Atlantic. When our technolgy is at that point, give or take a couple of hundred years, then and only then will our childrens children be those people.</p></td>

Here is a perfectly good plan to save our species from whatever unknown disasters MIGHT occour (never mind the worse case scenario for 2012) and all you brilliant minds can do is nit pick it to death? Its people like you that are the reason NASA blows. 
<br>
<br>
I have yet to read the book but I am going to at the soonest possible moment, ethier as soon as I can have it delivered via Amazon, or get down to my local bookstore to see if its there. Meanwhile there are plenty of short sited morons here to battle with over the basic premise and so called details. 
<br>

I mean you guys make it sound almost like its pointless to even try and save humanity from its downfalls and or extinctions.

Look at somthing like 2012 doomsday senario, the earths axis tilting over and a 30,000 foot high wall of water covering the earth...Your undergound colony shelter gonna protect you from that? Might, but Id rather wait it out on the moon, give it a few weeks to settle down and then blammo you got ready made water world to recolonize! Duration of moon stay: hmm hard to say perhaps just a few days depends on what would actually happen in given scenario...too bad its basially too late as you guys are saying its more like 25 years to get a moonbase like this up, forget 2. (Unless ceartain big movies just in theaters have it right and THEY have been working towards this for decades already.)</p></td>
