<p>I do a lot of traveling, so I get to check out the latest virtual-reality <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>s around the country. These are good indicators of where <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> technologies are taking us.</p>
<ul>
<li>At Orlando, at Walt Disney World's <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">CyberSpace</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://www.disney.go.com/disneyquest/Guide/Create/Mountain/mountain.htm" target="_new"> Mountain</a>, I used a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> to design my own roller coaster ride, and then climbed into a full-motion <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> and went for a wild ride. Called "Design Then Ride, it spins around and moves back and forth on two axes.</li>
<li>In Tucson, Arizona, I visited the Pima Air &amp; <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Museum. There, amidst the vintage planes and the SR-71 Blackbird (the world's fastest plane, which flies at over 2,000 miles and hour and went from Washington, DC to LA in only 64 minutes) a multi-person full motion <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> took us on an imaginary <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> back to the age of the Dinosaurs and then to ancient Egypt, amidst the throngs building the pyramids. It was great fun. They have four different rides you can choose from.</li>
<li>At EPCOT, I sat in an immersive <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> display that allowed me to fly through the Sistene Chapel and view every inch of the walls and the ceiling from any distance and any perspective.</li>
<li>At SGI (<a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> Graphics, Inc.) in Mountain View, California, I sat in the control seat of a 180 degree full-motion simulation of a stealth B-2 bomber flying over Iraq, simulating the real terrain and the anti-aircraft gun locations and other locales, and allowing me to practice bombing runs, using two <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s. This is the same <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that helped B-2 bomber pilots train for Gulf War missions. Last year, the Hayden <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">Planet</a>arium announced a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://www.sgi.com/features/2000/feb/hayden/" target="_new">planetarium</a> using <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> form <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> Graphics.</li>
<li>At Boeing in Seattle, I went on a virtual walk-through of a Boeing 777 aircraft. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_aided_design_entry.html">CAD</a>/CAM drawings of the entire aircraft were loaded into a VR <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that allowed customers and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to walk through the entire airplane, examine the overhead compartments, design the <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> of the plane, even examine the hydraulic and electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s behind the panels and fly through the interior, moving through floors into the cargo compartment!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://www.npac.syr.edu/projects/hpsin/vredu.html" target="_new">Northeast Parallel Architectures Center</a> at Syracuse University has used <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s to digitize the entire State of New York so school children can fly through any portion of the state from their school <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</li>
<li>In my local arcade there is a virtual ski <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> where you can ski down incredibly challenging slopes and avoiding trees and rocks while enjoying magnificent vistas of the Swiss Alps. It's truly remarkable, a modern day <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> adventure, for $1 a ride.</li>
<li><a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">Flight Simulator</a> is today one of the most popular <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s on the market. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> Adventure also has a <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for kids called Kid Pilot.</li>
<li>One of my favorite <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> sessions to date was on MTV, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers video for their melodic <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://stream.qtv.apple.com/channels/warner/refs/072000/californication_ref.mov" target="_new">Californication</a> track came on, and the band members starred in a fascinating fantasy of a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> virtual world where they surfboarded through the air and ran through a wild series of virtual worlds.</li>
</ul><h1>Musical Origins</h1><p>But VR simulation actually started in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. An incredible explosion of automatic musical <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s spread all over the world in a hundred forms, from the band organs that were attached to every merry go round to huge "orchestrions" with dozens of simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, some as big as the stage of a theater and some even simulating an entire orchestra. A few working <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s remain today in a museum such as Bellm's Cars and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> of Yesteryear, in Sarasota, Florida.</p>
<p>Then came player reed organs and player banjos, player harps and player saxophones, and the incredible <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://www.pianoworld.com/gallery/hupfeld_player.jpg" target="_new">Hupfeld Violano Phonolizt</a>, which simulated not only the playing of a piano with multiple levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, but three violins which were played with a huge rotating horsehair bow, with solenoids that move the violin to the bow, and a little <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that shakes the violin to create a vibrato effect. It might sound like a Rube Goldberg contraption, but I heard one play once at the home of a private collector in NYC, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> was so beautiful and soulful it made me want to cry.</p>
<p>Then, in the first part of the twentieth century, the ultimate musical simulation <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> was built and exhibited with great fanfare at the 1916 World's Fair: the "reproducing piano." This was a piano with such miraculous ability to reproduce the playing of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> artist that, at a demonstration at Carnegie Hall, a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> pianist behind a curtain on stage could not be distinguished from a reproducing piano by a theater full of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> critics and aficionados.</p>
<p>These were full grand pianos, some as long as 9 feet, which were equipped with special mechanisms that reproduced every nuance and subtlety of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> artist, even emulating the striking of a chord where the pinky hits a note ever so much stronger than the other fingers, and the crescendos move through the range of intensity from barely audible to shaking the room with intensity.</p>
<p>I know, I have two of these, fully restored, in my home in upper New York State. One, a 6'5" <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://members.aol.com/cotps/steinflo.htm" target="_new">Steinway</a>, was built in 1926, has a Duo-<a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">Art</a> mechanism, and I have original rolls cut by Rachmaninoff and Paderwski. And the other, a 5'8" Chickering grand piano, has an Ampico mechanism, with <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> played by Arthur Rubinstein and a later recording made by Liberace of the Godfather. They are truly amazing, and really do capture the actual playing of the original artists as if a ghost were sitting at the keyboard.</p>
<p>These <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s worked with air pneumatics. The ingenuity to replicate the subtlety of musical artistry was, it turns out, also led to the world's first <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, pilot students were sent aloft to solo after only a few hours of ground instruction, sometimes even less. An alarming number of the would-be pilots would crash on their first landing attempt, taking out the plane, the student, and anyone unfortunate enough to be standing on the ground when they landed.</p>
<p>Barnstorming pilot Ed Link, whose father owned the Link Player Piano and Theater Organ Company in Binghampton, NY, was a wizard in building and repairing player pianos and the huge theater organs, including those that played from a paper roll, that were still the rage just before the advent of high quality phonographs and long playing records.</p>
<p>Ed constructed the first <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164011/http://www.mapsairmuseum.org/images/LinkTrainer.jpg" target="_new">flight</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> in his barn in Binghampton. This was an amazing contraption that looked like the fuselage of an airplane and, when you sat in it, it would move about simulating the exact feelings of a plane in the air.</p>
<p>He fueled his <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of training pilots in <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>s by inventing the world's first electric sign and flying over Long Island with a wing full of lights lit up with a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable advertising message. It's not true that when you build it they will come. Ed had little luck getting anyone to take his <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> seriously, and he only survived the depression by placing the <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>s in arcades where children of all ages could climb into the cockpit and fly the make believe airplane.</p>
<p>It was only in 1939, when England went to war with Germany, that the utility of <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>s was realized, and the Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered 1,000 of Ed's <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, starting him on the road to fame and fortune. When the US entered the war and had to quickly train thousands of pilots, they, too, ordered thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>s, and Ed's business, the Link <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">Flight Simulator</a> company was underway. The company was eventually bought by Singer (the sewing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> people) who sold <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>s for jet planes, 747's, and even spaceships and lunar landers.</p>
<p>The industry of <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>s was born, and today you can take a ride in one with a dozen of your friends in many museums and country fairs and trade shows.</p>
<p>VR is imagined today and predicted to be many things, but what will it really lead to? VR will be as outdated, I predict, in the real world of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, as Compton's Encyclopedia turned out to be to the web <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>An excellent article, thoughtfully presenting the history and evolution of VR and the applications. I believe the future of VR will be played out in human interactions between distant beings, and perhaps even in medicine, as a means of rehabilitating patients who are returning to mobility or are even blind; using VR as a means of gaining strength in senses of motion and balance to accomplish more than just day-to-day tasks.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This may be a joke, or it may be nothing, but I got an e-mail from Linda that 
<br>
contained a very elaborate, professional Powerpoint presentation about the 
<br>
WTC, its history, the attacks, etc. I assume that it was in fact from Linda, although I 
<br>
haven't been able to contact her by phone so far. 
<br>
The presentation didn't contain any reference to the author, except to quote 
<br>
Cordell Hull, who to my knowledge never made any Powerpoint presentations. 
<br>
Being a suspicious hillbilly at heart, I checked the file info and found the author 
<br>
listed as "fatalleh." I put that in a search engine. Interestingly enough, that 
<br>
led me to the attached 
<br>
document about a business deal between Aramex Intl, a logistics company 
<br>
based in the Middle East and Germany, and American Bridge Company. The 
<br>
<br>
"Fatalleh" in the article was named "Mr. Osama Fatalleh Levant". Now, that 
<br>
doesn't have to mean anything, just like the fact that Aramex Germany seems to 
<br>
be based in Hamburg. I also found an article about American Bridge Company 
<br>
dealing with an OSHA case. In it, American Bridge Company is described as 
<br>
large steel construction company. Which also doesn't need to 
<br>
mean anything. 
<br>
<br>
And this might be just the kind of thing some college student might dream up to 
<br>
get people (like me) off on a wild goose chase. But I still find it a little weird. Although I 
<br>
don't know what the purpose might be, I could imagine that, for instance, if the 
<br>
file included some kind of web tracking function, the sender could watch who it 
<br>
was sent to, for whatever reason.

<br>
<br>
                  With Leading Express Company Atege
<br>
<br>
AMMAN, Jordan, March 18 /PRNewswire/ -- ARAMEX International (Nasdaq: ARMXF) and Atege, two of the Leading Transportation
<br>
Companies Serving the Middle East and German markets have reinforced their wide ranging strategic alliance to enhance both their sales and
<br>
their service capabilities between Germany and the Middle East. 
<br>
<br>
During a meeting held in Amman, Jordan between Mr. Gerd Richter, Chairman of Atege Spedition and Mr. Fadi Ghandour, President and
<br>
CEO of Aramex, Mr. Richter announced: "After a number of years of developing business on certain sectors between Germany and the
<br>
Middle East, our companies are ready now for a full scale alliance covering the major countries in which Aramex works and Atege's very
<br>
strong coverage of the German Market." 
<br>
<br>
Key issues discussed during the meeting included the development of a gateway for Aramex in Germany to service all Europe and an
<br>
increase in joint sales calling in most Middle Eastern Countries. Atege is also planning to position a sales representative in Dubai. 
<br>
<br>
The two sides also agreed on measures to increase traffic between Germany and the Middle East and on the development of a land freight
<br>
service to and from Germany. The Atege representatives explained how their "Challenge Group" concept which is now operating in Germany,
<br>
and their new network of agents in the Far East can benefit both sides. 
<br>
<br>
The ARAMEX-Atege relationship has already produced some remarkable successes. In March 1999 the two companies co-operated in
<br>
shipping a complete amusement park in kits from Germany to Dubai. The shipment weighing 845,500 tons and needing 52 full-sized mobile
<br>
trailers was carried by Hyundai's vessel "Asian Beauty" and, despite bad weather which included snow storms in the Alps, arrived in Dubai on
<br>
time. 
<br>
<br>
