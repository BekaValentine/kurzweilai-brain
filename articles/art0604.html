<div class="TeaserText">Nanotechnology pioneer Eric Drexler and Rice University Professor and Nobelist Richard Smalley have engaged in a crucial debate on the feasibility of molecular assembly. Smalley's position, which denies both the promise and the peril of molecular assembly, will ultimately backfire and will fail to guide nanotechnology research in the needed constructive direction, says Ray Kurzweil. By the 2020s, molecular assembly will provide tools to effectively combat poverty, clean up our environment, overcome disease, extend human longevity, and many other worthwhile pursuits, he predicts. </div>

<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> pioneer Eric Drexler and Rice University Professor 
              and Nobelist Richard Smalley have engaged in a crucial debate on 
              the feasibility of molecular assembly, which is the key to the most 
              revolutionary capabilities of nanotechnology.&#160; Although Smalley 
              was originally inspired by Drexler's ground-breaking works and has 
              himself become a champion of contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> initiatives in 
              nanotechnology, he has also taken on the role of key critic of Drexler's 
              primary idea of precisely guided molecular manufacturing.&#160; </p>
<p> This debate has picked up intensity with today's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html" target="_blank">publication</a> 
              of several rounds of this dialogue between these two pioneers.&#160;&#160;First 
              some background:</p>
<h3>Background: The Roots of Nanotechnology</h3>
            Nanotechnology promises the tools to rebuild the physical world, our 
            bodies and brains included, molecular fragment by molecular fragment, 
            potentially <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by atom.&#160; We are shrinking the key feature size of 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, in accordance with what I call the "law of accelerating 
            returns," at the exponential rate of approximately a factor of 4 per 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per decade.&#160; At this rate, the key feature sizes 
            for most <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and many mechanical technologies will be in the 
            nanotechnology range, generally considered to be under 100 nanometers, 
            by the 2020s (electronics has already dipped below this threshold, 
            albeit not yet in three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s and not self-assembling).&#160; 
            Meanwhile, there has been rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, particularly in the last 
            several years, in preparing the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual framework and design ideas 
            for the coming age of nanotechnology.&#160; 
            <p></p>
            Most nanotechnology historians date the conceptual birth of nanotechnology 
            to physicist <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>'s seminal speech in 1959, "There's Plenty 
            of Room at the Bottom," in which he described the profound implications 
            and the inevitability of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s at the level of atoms: 
            <p></p>
<p>"The principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, as far as I can see, do not speak against 
              the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom.&#160; It would be, 
              in principle, possible. . . .for a physicist to synthesize any chemical 
              substance that the chemist writes down. . .How?&#160; Put the atoms down 
              where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.&#160; The problems 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> can be greatly helped if our ability to 
              see what we are doing, and to do things on an atomic level, is ultimately 
              developed &#8211; a development which I think cannot be avoided."</p>
<p>An even earlier conceptual <a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a> for nanotechnology was formulated 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> theorist John Von Neumann in the early 1950s 
              with his model of a self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> based on a universal 
              constructor combined with a universal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.&#160; In this proposal, 
              the computer runs a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that directs the constructor, which 
              in turn constructs a copy of both the computer (including its <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> 
              program) and the constructor.&#160; At this level of description, Von 
              Neumann's proposal is quite abstract -- the computer and constructor 
              could be made in a great variety of ways, as well as from diverse 
              materials, and could even be a theoretical mathematical construction.&#160; 
              He took the concept one step further and proposed a "kinematic constructor," 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with at least one manipulator (arm) that would build a replica 
              of itself from a "sea of parts" in its midst.&#160; </p>
<p>It was left to Eric Drexler to found the modern field of nanotechnology, 
              with a draft of his seminal Ph.D. thesis in the mid 1980s, by essentially 
              combining these two intriguing suggestions.&#160; Drexler described a 
              Von Neumann Kinematic Constructor, which for its "sea of parts" 
              used atoms and molecular fragments, as suggested in Feynman's speech.&#160; 
              Drexler's vision cut across many disciplinary boundaries, and was 
              so far reaching, that no one was daring enough to be his thesis 
              advisor, except for my own mentor, <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>.&#160; Drexler's doctoral 
              thesis (premiered in his book, <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/meme/memelist.html?m%3D8" target="_top">Engines 
              of Creation</a></i> in 1986 and articulated technically in his 1992 
              book <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.foresight.org/Nanosystems/toc.html#c1%3E" target="_blank">Nanosystems</a></i>) 
              laid out the foundation of nanotechnology and provided the road 
              map still being pursued today.&#160; </p>
<p>Von Neumann's Universal Constructor, as applied to atoms and molecular 
              fragments, was now called a "universal <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>."&#160; Drexler's assembler 
              was universal because it could essentially make almost anything 
              in the world.&#160; A caveat is in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> here.&#160; The products of a universal 
              assembler necessarily have to follow the laws of physics and chemistry, 
              so only atomically stable structures would be viable.&#160; Furthermore, 
              any specific assembler would be restricted to building products 
              from its sea of parts, although the feasibility of using <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              atoms has been repeatedly demonstrated.&#160; </p>
<p>Although Drexler did not provide a detailed design of an assembler, 
              and such a design has still not been fully specified, his thesis 
              did provide extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> proofs for each of the principal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of a universal assembler, which include the following 
              subsystems:</p>
<ul>
<li> The <u>computer</u>: to provide the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to control 
                the assembly process.&#160; As with all of the subsystems, the computer 
                needs to be small and simple.&#160; Drexler described an intriguing 
                mechanical computer with molecular "locks" instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
                gates.&#160; Each lock required only 5 cubic nanometers of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and 
                could <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> 20 billion times a second.&#160; This proposal remains 
                more competitive than any known electronic technology, although 
                electronic computers built from three-dimensional arrays of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> may be a suitable alternative.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The <u>instruction </u><a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>: Drexler and his colleague 
                Ralph Merkle have proposed a "SIMD" (Single Instruction Multiple 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a>") architecture in which a single data store would record 
                the instructions and transmit them to trillions of molecular-sized 
                assemblers (each with their own simple computer) simultaneously.&#160; 
                Thus each assembler would not have to store the entire program 
                for creating the desired product.&#160; This "<a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a>" architecture 
                also addresses a key safety concern by shutting down the self-replication 
                process if it got out of control by terminating the centralized 
                source of the replication instructions.&#160; However, as Drexler points 
                out<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>, a nanoscale assembler 
                does not necessarily have to be self-replicating. Given the inherent 
                dangers in self-replication, the ethical standards proposed by 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> contain prohibitions against unrestricted 
                self-replication, especially in a natural environment.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> <u>Instruction transmission</u>: transmission of the instructions 
                from the centralized data store to each of the many assemblers 
                would be accomplished electronically if the computer is electronic 
                or through mechanical vibrations if Drexler's concept of a mechanical 
                computer were used.&#160; <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The <u>construction robot</u>: the constructor would be a simple 
                molecular robot with a single arm, similar to Von Neumann's kinematic 
                constructor, but on a tiny scale.&#160; The feasibility of building 
                molecular-based robot arms, gears, rotors, and motors has been 
                demonstrated in the years since Drexler's thesis, as I discuss 
                below.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The <u>robot arm tip</u>: Drexler's follow-up book in 1992, 
                <i>Nanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a></i>, 
                provided a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of feasible chemistries for the tip of the robot 
                arm that would be capable of grasping (using appropriate atomic 
                force fields) a molecular fragment, or even a single atom, and 
                then depositing it in a desired location.&#160; We know from the chemical 
                vapor deposition process used to construct artificial diamonds 
                that it is feasible to remove individual carbon atoms, as well 
                as molecular fragments that include carbon, and then place them 
                in another location through precisely controlled chemical reactions 
                at the tip.&#160; The process to build artificial diamond is a chaotic 
                process involving trillions of atoms, but the underlying process 
                has been harnessed to design a robot arm tip that can remove <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> 
                atoms from a source material and deposit it at desired location 
                in a molecular machine being constructed.&#160; In this proposal, the 
                tiny machines are built out of a diamond-like (called "diamondoid") 
                material.&#160; In addition to having great strength, the material 
                can be doped with impurities in a precise fashion to create electronic 
                components such as transistors.&#160; Simulations have shown that gears, 
                levers, motors, and other mechanical systems can also be constructed 
                from these carbon arrays.&#160; Additional proposals have been made 
                in the years since, including several innovative designs by Ralph 
                Merkle<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>.&#160; In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention 
                on carbon nanotubes, comprised of hexagonal arrays of carbon atoms 
                assembled in three dimensions, which are also capable of providing 
                both mechanical and electronic functions at the molecular level.&#160; 
                <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The assembler's <u>internal environment</u> needs to prevent 
                environmental impurities from interfering with the delicate assembly 
                process.&#160; Drexler's proposal is to maintain a near <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> and 
                build the assembler walls out of the same diamondoid material 
                that the assembler itself is capable of making.&#160; <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The <u><a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a></u> required for the assembly process can be 
                provided either through electricity or through chemical energy.&#160; 
                Drexler proposed a chemical process with the fuel interlaced with 
                the raw building material.&#160; More recent proposals utilize nanoengineered 
                fuel cells incorporating hydrogen and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> or glucose and oxygen.</li>
</ul>
            Although many <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s have been proposed, the typical assembler 
            has been described as a tabletop unit that can manufacture any physically 
            possible product for &#160;which we have a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> description.&#160; Products 
            can range from computers, clothes, and works of <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> to cooked meals.&#160; 
            Larger products, such as furniture, cars, or even houses, can be built 
            in a modular fashion, or using larger assemblers.&#160; Of particular <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance, 
            an assembler can create copies of itself.&#160; The incremental cost of 
            creating any physical product, including the assemblers themselves, 
            would be pennies per pound, basically the cost of the raw materials.&#160; 
            The real cost, of course, would be the value of the information describing 
            each type of product, that is the software that controls the assembly 
            process.&#160; Thus everything of value in the world, including physical 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, would be comprised essentially of information.&#160; We are not 
            that far from this situation today, since the "information <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>" 
            of products is rapidly asymptoting to 100 percent of their value.&#160; 
            <p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>, the centralized data store sends out commands simultaneously 
              to all of the assembly robots.&#160; There would be trillions of robots 
              in an assembler, each executing the same instruction at the same 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; The assembler creates these molecular robots by starting 
              with a small number and then using these robots to create additional 
              ones in an iterative fashion, until the requisite number of robots 
              has been created.&#160; </p>
<p>Each local robot has a local data storage that specifies the type 
              of mechanism it is building.&#160; This local data storage is used to 
              mask the global instructions being sent from the centralized data 
              store so that certain instructions are blocked and local <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s 
              are filled in.&#160; In this way, even though all of the assemblers are 
              receiving the same sequence of instructions, there is a level of 
              customization to the part being built by each molecular robot.&#160; 
              Each robot extracts the raw materials it needs, which includes individual 
              carbon atoms and molecular fragments, from the source material.&#160; 
              This source material also includes the requisite chemical fuel.&#160; 
              All of the requisite design requirements, including routing the 
              instructions and the source material, were described in detail in 
              Drexler's two classic works.</p>

<p>&#160;-- Eric Drexler</p>
<p>The ultimate existence proof of the feasibility of a molecular 
              assembler is <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> itself.&#160; Indeed, as we deepen out understanding 
              of the information basis of life processes, we are discovering specific 
              ideas to address the design requirements of a generalized molecular 
              assembler.&#160; For example, proposals have been made to use a molecular 
              energy source of glucose and <a class="thought" href="entries/atp_entry.html">ATP</a> similar to that used by biological 
              cells.&#160; </p>
<p>Consider how biology solves each of the design challenges of a 
              Drexler assembler.&#160; The ribosome represents both the computer and 
              the construction robot.&#160; Life does not use centralized data storage, 
              but provides the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> to every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>.&#160; The ability to restrict 
              the local data storage of a nanoengineered robot to only a small 
              part of the assembly code (using the "broadcast" architecture), 
              particularly when doing self-replication, is one critical way nanotechnology 
              can be engineered to be safer than biology.&#160; </p>
<p>With the advent of full-scale nanotechnology in the 2020s, we will 
              have the potential to replace biology's genetic information repository 
              in the cell <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> with a nanoengineered system that would maintain 
              the genetic code and simulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, the ribosome, 
              and other <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of the computer in biology's assembler.&#160; There 
              would be significant benefits in doing this.&#160; We could eliminate 
              the accumulation of DNA transcription errors, one major source of 
              the aging process.&#160; We could introduce DNA changes to essentially 
              reprogram our genes (something we'll be able to do long before this 
              scenario, using gene-therapy techniques).&#160; </p>
<p>With such a nanoengineered system, the recommended broadcast architecture 
              could enable us to turn off unwanted replication, thereby defeating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, autoimmune reactions, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> processes.&#160; Although 
              most of these disease processes will have already been defeated 
              by genetic engineering, reengineering the computer of life using 
              nanotechnology could eliminate any remaining obstacles and create 
              a level of durability and flexibility that goes vastly beyond the 
              inherent capabilities of biology.</p>
<p>Life's local data storage is, of course, the DNA strands, broken 
              into specific genes on the <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s.&#160; The task of instruction-masking 
              (blocking genes that do not contribute to a particular cell type) 
              is controlled by the short RNA molecules and peptides that govern 
              gene <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>.&#160; The internal environment the ribosome is able 
              to function in is the particular chemical environment maintained 
              inside the cell, which includes a particular acid-alkaline equilibrium 
              (pH between 6.8 and 7.1 in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells) and other chemical balances 
              needed for the delicate operations of the ribosome.&#160; The cell wall 
              is responsible for protecting this internal cellular environment 
              from disturbance by the outside world.&#160; </p>
<p>The robot arm tip would use the ribosome's ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> 
              enzymatic reactions to break off each amino acid, each bound to 
              a specific transfer RNA, and to connect it to its adjoining amino 
              acid using a peptide bond.&#160; </p>
<p>However, the goal of molecular manufacturing is not merely to replicate 
              the molecular assembly capabilities of biology.&#160; Biological systems 
              are limited to building systems from protein, which has profound 
              limitations in strength and speed.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a>s built from diamondoid 
              gears and rotors can be thousands of times faster and stronger than 
              biological cells.&#160; The comparison is even more dramatic with regard 
              to computation: the switching speed of nanotube-based computation 
              would be millions of times faster than the extremely slow transaction 
              speed of the electrochemical switching used in <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian interneuronal 
              connections (typically around 200 transactions per second, although 
              the nonlinear transactions that take place in the dendrites and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s are more complex than single computations).&#160; </p>
<p>The concept of a diamondoid assembler described above uses a consistent 
              input material (for construction and fuel).&#160; This is one of several 
              protections against molecule-scale replication of robots in an uncontrolled 
              fashion in the outside world.&#160; Biology's replication robot, the 
              ribosome, also requires carefully controlled source and fuel materials, 
              which are provided by our digestive system.&#160; As nano-based replicators 
              become more sophisticated, more capable of extracting carbon atoms 
              and carbon-based molecular fragments from less well-controlled source 
              materials, and able to operate outside of controlled replicator 
              enclosures such as in the biological world, they will have the potential 
              to present a grave threat to that world, particularly in view of 
              the vastly greater strength and speed of nano-based replicators 
              over any biological system.&#160; This is, of course, the source of great 
              controversy, which is alluded to in the Drexler-Smalley debate article 
              and letters.</p>
<p>In the decade since publication of Drexler's <i>Nanosystems</i>, 
              each aspect of Drexler's conceptual designs has been strengthened 
              through additional design proposals, <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> simulations, 
              and, most importantly, actual construction of molecular machines.&#160; 
              Boston College chemistry professor T. Ross Kelly reported in the 
              journal <i>Nature</i> that his construction of a chemically-powered 
              nanomotor was built from 78 atoms.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>&#160; 
              A biomolecular research group headed by <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. D. Montemagno created 
              an ATP-fueled nanomotor.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>&#160; 
              Another molecule-sized motor fueled by solar energy was created 
              by Ben Feringa at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands 
              out of 58 atoms.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>&#160; Similar 
              progress has been made on other molecular-scale mechanical components 
              such as gears, rotors, and levers.&#160; Systems demonstrating the use 
              of chemical energy and acoustic energy (as originally described 
              by Drexler) have been designed, simulated, and, in many cases, actually 
              constructed.&#160; Substantial progress has been made in developing various 
              types of electronic components from molecule-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, particularly 
              in the area of carbon nanotubes, an area that Smalley has pioneered.&#160; 
            </p>
<h3>Fat and Sticky Fingers</h3>
<p>In the wake of rapidly expanding development of each facet of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              nanotechnology systems, no serious flaw to Drexler's universal assembler 
              concept has been discovered or described.&#160; Smalley's highly publicized 
              objection in <i>Scientific American</i> <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref6">[6]</a> 
              was based on a distorted description of the Drexler proposal; it 
              ignored the extensive body of work in the past decade.&#160; As a pioneer 
              of carbon nanotubes, Smalley has gone back and forth between enthusiasm 
              and skepticism, having written that "nanotechnology holds the answer, 
              to the extent there are answers, to most of our pressing material 
              needs in energy, health, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>, food, water 
              &#8230;."</p>
<p>Smalley describes Drexler's assembler as consisting of five to 
              ten "fingers" (manipulator arms) to hold, move, and place each atom 
              in the machine being constructed.&#160; He then goes on to point out 
              that there isn't room for so many fingers in the cramped space that 
              a nanobot assembly robot has to work (which he calls the "fat fingers" 
              problem) and that these fingers would have difficulty letting go 
              of their atomic cargo because of molecular attraction forces (the 
              "sticky fingers" problem).&#160; Smalley describes the "intricate three-dimensional 
              waltz that is carried out" by five to fifteen atoms in a typical 
              chemical reaction.&#160; Drexler's proposal doesn't look anything like 
              the straw man description that Smalley criticizes.&#160; Drexler's proposal, 
              and most of those that have followed, have a single probe, or "finger."&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Moreover, there have been extensive description and analyses of 
              viable tip chemistries that do not involve grasping and placing 
              atoms as if they were mechanical pieces to be deposited in place.&#160; 
              For example, the feasibility of moving hydrogen atoms using Drexler's 
              "propynyl hydrogen <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>" tip<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> has been extensively confirmed in the intervening years.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&#160; The ability of the scanning probe microscope (SPM), developed 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> in 1981, and the more sophisticated atomic force microscope 
              to place individual atoms through specific reactions of a tip with 
              a molecular-scale structure provide additional existence proofs.&#160; 
              Indeed, if Smalley's critique were valid, none of us would be here 
              to discuss it because life itself would be impossible.&#160; </p>
<p>Smalley also objects that despite "working furiously &#160;. . . generating 
              even a tiny amount of a product would take [a nanobot] &#8230; millions 
              of years."&#160; Smalley is correct, of course, that an assembler with 
              only one nanobot wouldn't produce any appreciable quantities of 
              a product.&#160; However, the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> concept of nanotechnology is that 
              we will need trillions of nanobots to accomplish meaningful results.&#160; 
              This is also the source of the safety concerns that have received 
              ample attention.&#160; Creating trillions of nanobots at <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able cost 
              will require the nanobots to make themselves.&#160; This self-replication 
              solves the economic issue while introducing grave dangers.&#160; Biology 
              used the same solution to create <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s with trillions of cells, 
              and indeed we find that virtually all diseases derive from biology's 
              self-replication process gone awry.&#160; </p>
<p>Earlier challenges to the concepts underlying nanotechnology have 
              also been effectively addressed.&#160; Critics pointed out that nanobots 
              would be subject to bombardment by thermal vibration of nuclei, 
              atoms, and molecules.&#160; This is one reason conceptual designers of 
              nanotechnology have emphasized building structural components from 
              diamondoid or carbon nanotubes.&#160; Increasing the strength or stiffness 
              of a system reduces its susceptibility to thermal effects.&#160; Analysis 
              of these designs have shown them to be thousands of times more stable 
              in the presence of thermal effects than biological systems, so they 
              can operate in a far wider temperature range<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>Similar challenges were made regarding positional uncertainty from 
              quantum effects, based on the extremely small feature size of nanoengineered 
              devices.&#160;&#160;&#160; Quantum effects are significant for an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>, but 
              a single carbon atom nucleus is more than 20,000 times more massive 
              than an electron.&#160; A nanobot will be constructed from hundreds of 
              thousands to millions of carbon and other atoms, so a nanobot will 
              be billions of times more massive than an electron.&#160; Plugging this 
              ratio in the fundamental equation for quantum positional uncertainty 
              shows this to be an insignificant factor.&#160; </p>
<p>Power has represented another challenge.&#160; Drexler's original proposals 
              involved glucose-oxygen fuel cells, which have held up well in feasibility 
              studies.&#160; An advantage of the glucose-oxygen approach is that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> 
              applications can harness the glucose, oxygen, and ATP resources 
              already provided by the human digestive system.&#160; A nanoscale motor 
              was recently created using propellers made of nickel and powered 
              by an ATP-based enzyme.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>&#160; </p>
<p>However, recent progress in implementing <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a>-scale and even nanoscale 
              hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells have provided an alternative approach.&#160; 
              Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, with hydrogen provided by safe methanol 
              fuel, have made substantial progress in recent years.&#160; A small company 
              in Massachusetts, Integrated Fuel Cell Technologies, Inc.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a> 
              has demonstrated a MEMS-based fuel cell.&#160; Each postage-stamp- sized 
              device contains thousands of microscopic fuel cells and includes 
              the fuel lines and electronic controls.&#160; NEC plans to introduce 
              fuel cells based on nanotubes in 2004 for notebook computers and 
              other portable electronics.&#160; They claim their small power sources 
              will power devices for up to 40 hours before the user needs to change 
              the methanol canister.&#160; </p>
<h3>The Debate Heats Up</h3>
<p>On April 16, 2003, Drexler responded to Smalley's Scientific American 
              article with an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0560.html" target="_top">open 
              letter</a>.&#160; He cited 20 years of research by himself and others 
              and responded specifically to the fat and sticky fingers objection.&#160; 
              As I discussed above, molecular assemblers were never described 
              as having fingers at all, but rather precise positioning of reactive 
              molecules.&#160; Drexler cited biological enzymes and ribosomes as examples 
              of precise molecular assembly in the natural world.&#160; Drexler closes 
              by quoting Smalley's own observation that "when a scientist says 
              something is possible, they're probably underestimating how long 
              it will take.&#160; But if they say it's impossible, they're probably 
              wrong."</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html" target="_blank">Three 
              more rounds</a> of this debate were published today.&#160; Smalley responds 
              to Drexler's open letter by backing off of his fat and sticky fingers 
              objection and acknowledging that enzymes and ribosomes do indeed 
              engage in the precise molecular assembly that Smalley had earlier 
              indicated was impossible. Smalley says biological enzymes only work 
              in water and that such water-based chemistry is limited to biological 
              structures such as "wood, flesh and bone." As Drexler has stated<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>, 
              this is erroneous. Many enzymes, even those that ordinarily work 
              in water, can also function in anhydrous organic solvents and some 
              enzymes can operate on <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s in the vapor phase, with no liquid 
              at all. <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>. </p>
<p>Smalley goes on to state (without any derivation or citations) 
              that enzymatic-like reactions can only take place with biological 
              enzymes.&#160; This is also erroneous. It is easy to see why biological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> adopted water-based chemistry. &#160; Water is the most abundant 
              substance found on our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.&#160; It also comprises 70 to 90 percent 
              of our bodies, our food, and indeed of all organic <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>.&#160; Most 
              people think of water as fairly simple, but it is a far more complex 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> than conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> suggests.</p>
<p>As every grade school child knows, water is comprised of molecules, 
              each containing two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, the 
              most commonly known chemical formula, H 2O.&#160; However, consider some 
              of water's complications and their implications.&#160; In a liquid state, 
              the two hydrogen atoms make a 104.5&#176; angle with the oxygen atom, 
              which increases to 109.5&#176; when water freezes.&#160; This is why water 
              molecules are more spread out in the form of ice, providing it with 
              a lower density than liquid water.&#160; This is why ice floats.&#160; </p>
<p>Although the overall water molecule is electrically neutral, the 
              placement of the electrons creates polarization effects.&#160; The side 
              with the hydrogen atoms is relatively positive in electrical charge, 
              whereas the oxygen side is slightly negative.&#160; So water molecules 
              do not exist in isolation, rather they combine with one another 
              in small groups to assume, typically, pentagonal or hexagonal shapes<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>.&#160; These multi-molecule structures can change back and 
              forth between hexagonal and pentagonal configurations 100 billion 
              times a second.&#160;&#160; At room temperature, only about 3 percent of the 
              clusters are hexagonal, but this increases to 100 percent as the 
              water gets colder.&#160; This is why snowflakes are hexagonal.&#160; </p>
<p>These three-dimensional electrical properties of water are quite 
              powerful and can break apart the strong chemical bonds of other 
              compounds.&#160; Consider what happens when you put salt into water.&#160; 
              Salt is quite stable when dry, but is quickly torn apart into its 
              ionic components when placed in water.&#160; The negatively charged oxygen 
              side of the water molecules attracts positively charged sodium ions 
              (Na<sup>+</sup>), while the positively charged hydrogen side of 
              the water molecules attracts the negatively charged chlorine ions 
              (Cl<sup>-</sup>).&#160; In the dry form of salt, the sodium and chlorine 
              atoms are tightly bound together, but these bonds are easily broken 
              by the electrical charge of the water molecules.&#160; Water is considered 
              "the universal solvent" and is involved in most of the biochemical 
              pathways in our bodies.&#160; So we can regard the chemistry of life 
              on our planet primarily as water chemistry.&#160; </p>
<p>However, the primary thrust of our technology has been to develop 
              systems that are not limited to the restrictions of biological evolution, 
              which exclusively adopted water-based chemistry and proteins as 
              its foundation.&#160; Biological systems can fly, but if you want to 
              fly at 30,000 feet and at hundreds or thousands of miles per hour, 
              you would use our modern technology, not proteins.&#160; Biological systems 
              such as human brains can remember things and do calculations, but 
              if you want to do <a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">data mining</a> on billions of items of information, 
              you would want to use our electronic technology, not unassisted 
              human brains.&#160; </p>
<p>Smalley is ignoring the past decade of research on alternative 
              means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided 
              molecular reactions.&#160; Precisely controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of diamondoid 
              (diamond-like material formed into precise <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s) has been extensively 
              studied, including the ability to remove a single hydrogen atom 
              from a hydrogenated diamond surface.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>&#160; Related research supporting the feasibility of hydrogen abstraction 
              and precisely-guided diamondoid synthesis has been conducted at 
              the Materials and Process Simulation Center at Caltech; the Department 
              of Materials <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and Engineering at North Carolina State University; 
              the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, the University of Kentucky; 
              the United States Naval Academy, and the Xerox Palo Alto Research 
              Center.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Smalley is also ignoring the well-established scanning probe microscope 
              mentioned above, which uses precisely controlled molecular reactions.&#160; 
              Building on these concepts, Ralph Merkle has described tip reactions 
              that can involve up to four reactants.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>&#160; 
              There is extensive literature on site-specific reactions that can 
              be precisely guided and that would be feasible for the tip chemistry 
              in a molecular assembler.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>&#160; 
              Smalley ignores this body of literature when he maintains that only 
              biological enzymes in water can perform this type of reaction.&#160; 
              Recently, many tools that go beyond SPMs are emerging that can reliably 
              manipulate atoms and molecular fragments.&#160; </p>
<p>On September 3, 2003, Drexler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0590.html" target="_top">responded</a> 
              to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html" target="_blank">Smalley's 
              response</a> by alluding once again to the extensive body of literature 
              that Smalley ignores.&#160; He cites the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> to a modern factory, 
              only at a nano-scale.&#160; He cites analyses of transition state theory 
              indicating that positional control would be feasible at megahertz 
              frequencies for appropriately selected reactants.&#160; </p>
<p>The latest installment of this debate is a <u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html" target="_blank">follow-up 
              letter</a></u> by Smalley.&#160; This letter is short on specifics and 
              science and long on imprecise metaphors that avoid the key issues.&#160; 
              He writes, for example, that "much like you can't make a boy and 
              a girl fall in <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> with each other simply by pushing them together, 
              you cannot make precise chemistry occur as desired between two molecular 
              objects with simple mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>&#8230;cannot be done simply by mushing 
              two molecular objects together."&#160; He again acknowledges that enzymes 
              do in fact accomplish this, but refuses to acknowledge that such 
              reactions could take place outside of a biological-like system: 
              "this is why I led you&#8230;..to talk about real chemistry with real 
              enzymes&#8230;.any such system will need a liquid medium.&#160; For the enzymes 
              we know about, that liquid will have to be water, and the types 
              of things that can be synthesized with water around cannot be much 
              broader than meat and bone of biology."</p>
<p>I can understand Drexler's frustration in this debate because I 
              have had many critics that do not bother to read or understand the 
              data and arguments that I have presented for my own conceptions 
              of future technologies.&#160; Smalley's argument is of the form that 
              "we don't have 'X' today, therefore 'X' is impossible."&#160; I encounter 
              this class of argument repeatedly in the area of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>.&#160; 
              Critics will cite the limitations of today's systems as proof that 
              such limitations are inherent and can never be overcome.&#160; These 
              critics ignore the extensive list of contemporary examples of AI 
              (for example, airplanes and <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s that fly and guide themselves, 
              automated diagnosis of electrocardiograms and blood cell images, 
              automated detection of credit card fraud, automated investment programs 
              that routinely outperform human analysts, telephone-based natural 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> response systems, and hundreds of others) that represent 
              working systems that are <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly available today that were 
              only research programs a decade ago.&#160; </p>
<p>Those of us who attempt to project into the future based on well-grounded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies are at a disadvantage.&#160; Certain future realities may 
              be inevitable, but they are not yet manifest, so they are easy to 
              deny.&#160; There was a small body of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> at the beginning of the 
              20<sup>th</sup> century that heavier-than-air flight was feasible, 
              but mainstream skeptics could simply point out that if it was so 
              feasible, why had it never been demonstrated?&#160; In 1990, Kasparov 
              scoffed at the idea that machine <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> players could ever possibly 
              defeat him.&#160; When it happened in 1997, observers were quick to dismiss 
              the achievement by dismissing the importance of chess.&#160; </p>
<p>Smalley reveals at least part of his motives at the end of his 
              most recent letter when he writes: </p>
<p>"A few weeks ago I gave a talk on nanotechnology and energy titled 
              'Be a Scientist, Save the World' to about 700 middle and high school 
              students in the Spring Branch ISD, a large public school system 
              here in the Houston area.&#160;&#160;&#160; Leading up to my visit the students 
              were asked to 'write an essay on 'why I am a Nanogeek.&#160; Hundreds 
              responded, and I had the privilege of reading the top 30 essays, 
              picking my favorite top 5. Of the essays I read, nearly half assumed 
              that self-replicating nanobots were possible, and most were deeply 
              worried about what would happen in their future as these nanobots 
              spread around the world.&#160;&#160;&#160; I did what I could to allay their fears, 
              but there is no question that many of these youngsters have been 
              told a bedtime story that is deeply troubling. You and people around 
              you have scared our children."</p>
<p>I would point out to Smalley that earlier critics also expressed 
              skepticism that either world-wide communication <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s or software 
              viruses that would spread across them were feasible.&#160; Today, we 
              have both the benefits and the damage from both of these capabilities.&#160; 
              However, along with the danger of software viruses has also emerged 
              a technological <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>.&#160; While it does not completely protect 
              us, few people would advocate eliminating the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> in order 
              to eliminate software viruses.&#160; We are obtaining far more benefit 
              than damage from this latest example of intertwined promise and 
              peril.&#160; </p>
<p>Smalley's approach to reassuring the public about the potential 
              abuse of this future technology is not the right strategy.&#160; Denying 
              the feasibility of both the promise and the peril of molecular assembly 
              will ultimately backfire and fail to guide research in the needed 
              constructive direction.&#160; By the 2020s, molecular assembly will provide 
              tools to effectively combat <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, clean up our environment, overcome 
              disease, extend human longevity, and many other worthwhile pursuits.&#160;</p>
<p>Like every other technology that humankind has created, it can 
              also be used to amplify and enable our destructive side.&#160; It is 
              important that we approach this technology in a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able manner 
              to gain the profound benefits it promises, while avoiding its dangers.&#160; 
              Drexler and his colleagues at the Foresight Institute have been 
              in the forefront of developing the ethical guidelines and design 
              considerations needed to guide the technology in a safe and constructive 
              direction.&#160; </p>
<p>Denying the feasibility of an impending technological transformation 
              is a short-sighted strategy.&#160; </p>

              much that is still up for debate, as shown by the numerous articles 
              still being published about this most basic of molecules, H<sub>2</sub>0. For 
              example, D. Klug. 2001. "Glassy water." <i>Science</i> 294:2305-2306; 
              P. Geissler et al., 2001. "Autoionization in liquid water." <i>Science</i>

<p>A water molecule has slightly negative and slightly positive ends, 
              which means water molecules interact with other water molecules 
              to form networks. The partially positive hydrogen atom on one molecule 
              is attracted to the partially negative oxygen on a neighboring molecule 
              (hydrogen bonding). Three-dimensional hexamers involving 6 molecules 
              are thought to be particularly stable, though none of these clusters 
              lasts longer than a few picoseconds.</p>
<p>The polarity of water results in a number of anomalous properties. 
              One of the best known is that the solid phase (ice) is less dense 
              than the liquid phase. This is because the volume of water varies 
              with the temperature, and the volume increases by about 9% on freezing. 
              Due to hydrogen bonding, water also has a higher-than-expected boiling 
              point. </p>

<br>
if you have been reading the discussions here and keeping abreast of the developments in atomic engineering [ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.10/atoms.html" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.10/atoms.html  </a> ] you would already know that Programmable Artificial Matter made from sculpted electron shells already exists [the Wired article is 2 years old! ]- and the technology is both further along and more practical than most molecular assembly approaches- and will in fact allow nano engineering to be more easily accomplished- please see the discussion: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/frame.html" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/frame.html</a>
<br>
<br>
Plasma Physics is also exploding- both in terms of Cosmological theory [talk to Subtillion ] and in engineering- as we learn how to manipulate plasmas we have discovered the way toward Programmable Matter with electron shells- but others have found that complex plasmas can also form their own complex filamentary network architectures and form cellular and neural structures that meet most of the requirements of life- as well as provide many robust types of network computing substrates [ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614000554/http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994174" target="_blank">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns999  94174</a> ]
<br>
<br>
<br>
what is popularly known as "nanotechnology" is a stop-gap technology- it will only see limited clinical application as somatic therapies- but will quickly be outmoded before it even gets going by wholly proprietary progmatter structures/systems far beyond the limitations of natural matter-
<br>
<br>
Programmable matter exists and is 10-20 years from ubiquitous/mundane utility- challenges and structural difficulties can be dealt with by simply customizing/manipulating the proprietary programmable-atoms so that the forces/properties work the way we wish- nanotech working within the constraints of natural matter is HARDER and is still 20-40 years away- perhaps more years off before we would see full-on self-sustaining intelligent assembler swarms capable of truly manipulating our selves and environment-

The author of that Wired article suggests we'll simply weave together our little 2D programmable quantum dot strips to make solids, or 
<br>
"wellstones" as he calls it.  What about all the wires in that mess?!  That's ridiculous.  This is not morphing technology, this is technology that simulates the external skin of any element and beyond.  Which still is very cool but won't lead to any morphing of Ferraris as they are talking about on Slashdot.
<br>
<br>
Plus, he's talking 20-40 years in the future.  Any technology estimation that's in the 40 years department IMO is really a long shot.  Who knows what riduculous things were being predicted in 1960?  Most technologies of note today were probably not even considered in 1960.  I don't mean to sound totaly ignorant here, obviously where we are today comes from solid research being done in those days... my point is that for someone to be throwing around ETAs of "..maybe another 20 years.." must know that we have LONG LONG LONG time to go with this stuff and that right now most of it seems INCONCEIVABLE.  I would agree with that.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
as I mentioned in previous discussions- the limitation of the 2d "wellstone" is not even a consideration- this is the problem with failing to understand the key concept: ANYTHING that can be made from electrons- as Programmable Matter is- can rather easily be constructed with precise MAGNETIC FIELDS- the idea that the technology will be limited to some physical wellstone is quite short-sited indeed- full 3d structures/ecologies/systems will naturally follow early on in the field- and the problems with artificial shells being to large to interact/emulate natural matter are- of course- a minor and temporary concern- as there are likely many ways to project electrons to form a small enough shell- the key is to find the right generative sysnthesis- electro-topology 101- no worries-
<br>
<br>
particle physisists do trickier operations with magnetic fields every day at Fermilab and CERN- upgrading programmable matter synthesis to a completely instrumentality-free process is a non-issue and a given at this point! think: 
<br>
<br>
-any "object" made of electrons/plasma that can be created by humankind can be generated with projected magnetism-
<br>
<br>
-magnetic fields can be formed/manipulated by electrons-
<br>
<br>
see it? a couple of tweaks and you can create swarms of complex progmatter structures which can GENERATE THEMSELVES- they can reproduce themselves endlessly and in infinite variation: you end up with a substrate of fundemental quantum/spacetime plasma that can reshape itself in any way and endlessly recreate/reproduce itself and it's structures/agents in any form- 
<br>
<br>
when a species creates a substrate/matrix of fundemental forces/particles that can create/reproduce/manipulate/compute themselves  with only those fundemetal forces themselves as a limiter- you have created the ultimate expression of the Universe shaping and being aware of itself- you have created Theogenesis [at the very least!]</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>when you read the article- it seems to me that McCarthy himself doesn't really get the epiphany of what being able to make atoms out of electron shells REALLY implies-
<br>
<br>
I think the problem is a lack of cross-discipline knowledge of QED [quantum electrodynamics]- as long as you think that you need a "P-N junction" or some similar clunky physical device to create programmable matter- all it can be is an exotic way of changing masks- 
<br>
but he seems to not understand that if you can create an electron shell with a physical P-N junction- you can do the same thing with an approriatlely structured helical array of Venturi vortecies that can be naturally formed in charged plasma- and such an array can be formed with programmable electron shells themselves- scooping/densifying/folding/rotating a plasma in it's path- progmatter can generate progmatter- without limit-

then the whole 2d skin thing falls away- quintillion swarms of pico-scale charged-plasma p-n junction arrays creating more arrays and any kind of artificial atoms as is required- and it is all NATURAL- it's not even a TECHNOLOGY per se- the technology is being able to harness and generate electricity- the details that gets you a god-like prog-matter cosmogenic matrix is simply a matter of where you point your EM emitters and where you position the knobs- 
<br>
the challenge is all in how to set-up an expansive/emergent progmatter ecology that cultivates limetless spacetime synthesis: a program for progmatter systems- the technology and tools already exist- most of it is natural dynamism! we just need to figure out how to make the plasma behave in a way as to become this cosmogenic matrix-</p></td>

<br>
<br>
I think you underestimate the task of controling magnetic fields in such ways.  I honestly don't have a great background in the field but I wouldn't want you to get away without anyone questioning your ideas. :-)  Wouldn't an independent magnetic field be needed for eash P-N junction?  How would these be "applied" individually?  
<br>
<br>
Also, I don't believe the "Theo-genesis" theory of electrons controling magnetic fields controling electrons is possible.  We would have seen evidence of this by now if it were possible.  The universe is one big mother, true, so it might be out there.  It just seems too easy though.  I think that "things fall apart" too easily in this universe and no life form so elegant could exist.  Comparatively dumb matter like we're made of allows so many more redundancies and safety from the natural entropic increases of the universe.
<br>
<br>
It's a really interesting idea though, plasma being alive.  Am I missing some points?  What doyou think?</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology is all about making machines and materials molecule-by-molecule. Such precision promises to enable microscopic machines, faster electronics, and materials that harbor new properties. 
<br>
<br>
Because it is difficult and tedious to manually put atoms and molecules in place, researchers are looking for ways to cause materials to self-assemble. One way to do this is to coax nature's self-assembly molecule -- DNA -- to assemble into templates that can in turn cause other molecules to line up in all the right places.
<br>
<br>
Technion-Israel Institute of Technology researchers have brought the idea forward by demonstrating a DNA-template self-assembly process that makes transistors in a test tube using an assortment of raw ingredients: carbon nanotubes, silver, gold, and four types of protein molecules.
<br>
<br>
The process could eventually be used to make materials, molecular machines and electronics, and even entire computers.
<br>
<br>
The key to the researchers' processes was finding ways to connect nonbiological materials to specific sequences of DNA bases. The researchers coated a carbon nanotube with a protein that naturally attached to an antibody that attached to a second antibody that attached to the DNA sequence. They added electrodes to the device by coating a portion of the DNA strand with gold.
<br>
<br>
It is not clear how long it will take before the self-assembly process can be used to manufacture components, according to the researchers. The work appeared in the November 21, 2003 issue of Science.

You suffer from the same huge blind spot that Drexler repeatedly fails to acknowledge.
<br>
<br>
Like Drexler, you posit a system with the following elements:
<br>
<br>
-The computer
<br>
-The instruction architecture
<br>
-Instruction transmission
<br>
-The construction robot
<br>
-The robot arm tip
<br>
-The asembler&#8217;s internal environment
<br>
-The energy required
<br>
<br>
And unfortunately, like Drexler, you fail to posit:
<br>
<br>
-The nanoscale sensory feedback loops which report success and failure back within each subsystem at each level of detail from the atomic level up to the entire system level.
<br>
<br>
Without both nanoscale sensing means, and nanoscale feedback loops connected to those sensing means, the whole scheme collapses.
<br>
<br>
I urge you to read up on the nanoscale cryogenic sensory feedback loop technique (STM analog current converted to an audio signal) which was used by Eigler and company at IBM in order to position single atoms over a time scale of minutes to hours. And then I challenge you, or anyone, to come up with a suite of nanoscale sensory feedback loops which has even a glimmer of hope of realizing Drexler's (and your) fantasies.
<br>
<br>
Please try to be both complete and specific with at least one example at the atomic level; the higher levels then might become possible.
<br>
<br>
And please try to raise this discussion above the level of a religious debate. So far you have failed to do so.</p></td>

if you refer to the article on plasma networks and study plasmas- you will note that plasma naturally forms neuralnet-like filametory networks capible of any manner of complex feedback circuits- and more importantly- these plasmoid networks will synthesize at ANY SACLE on down through nano all the way to PLANCK-SCALE- [and perhaps beyond that to transfinite microscales- if the Plasma/Aether cosmologies are correct]
<br>
<br>
there is no scale large or small that does not naturally form systemic networks utilizing noncompromise and feedback- it's the fractal shape of the Cosmos- so network communications is an inherant and unavoidable emergence of ALL systems at every scale in nature! consider: All complex systems utilize feedback networks in their system dynamism- including the plasmic structures of particle synthesis/interaction and especially nano-scale moloecular eco-logics-</p></td>

explain yourself!
<br>
<br>
the FACT that feedback networks naturally form at all scales means that an appropriate communication network can be adapted for a system REGARDLESS of it's physical extent- this is unavoidable fact- how do you adapt such a scheme for a nano ecology? that is simply an architectural quesion- a programming question- specific to the precise needs of whatever nano architecture you are constructing-
<br>
<br>
just because you don't posess a blueprint for a lifting body- doesn't mean you can claim that flight is impossible- when you already know the principles of lift the specs of the lifitng body are a formality-
<br>
<br>
but if you want the outline of an answer- look to biology- specifically cytology- the organization of information in autopoetic networks like immune systems for instance- provide a natural blueprint for the communications networks of a nano-ecology- and the causal pathways for NATURALLY the same- so you don't even have to know the specifics of the system's dynamics- all  you have to do is put agent systems in the right places and have the right veriety and population of agent systems- and voila- nature will build you a feedback network between their interactions-

I think our failure to meet here is because of perception- after reading your posts it is clear that you are thinking of nanotechnology in terms of mechanical engineering of non-organic robotic agents with telecommunications- trying to do nano-engineering in this way WOULD cause alot of confuson and doubt-
<br>
<br>
GET THAT CARTESIAN CLOCK OUT OF YOU HEAD BOY!!! :p
<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology- whether organic or inorganic in materials- is wholly and fundementaly BIOLOGICAL in structure and dynamism!
<br>
<br>
you don't manufacture nano-machines- you adapt and manipulate biological autopoeitic systems and organisms into a controllable nano-ecology-
<br>
<br>
immune systems/ neural networks/ metabolic systems ARE natural nano technologies which utilize nanao=scale feedback circuits as part of their structure! they already exist- all we need to do is adapt and modify to our specifications and we have any number of nano-ecological tools at our disposal</p></td>

<center><p class="mindxquote"> "and perhaps beyond that to transfinite microscales- if the Plasma/Aether cosmologies are correct"
<br>
<br>
If that nonsense was written on a website, it would have been listed at www.crank.net 
<br>
<br>
it's the fractal shape of the Cosmos 
<br>
Fractals have infinite resolution and detail. Spacetime is only finitely differentiable due to its quantum nature. See e.g. The World According to Quantum Physics by Mohrhoff.  </p></center>
<br>
are you arguing against Plasma Cosmology and supporting the "epicycle science" of Relativity/Copenhagen QM/ String Theory? If so- I'll just let Subtillion field this [as he has many many times] or you can simply read his extensive posts and links on the subject- ;)

re: spelling- notice the lack of an edit button or spell-check on the post screen? that means you are going to have to deal with my crappy extemporaneous typing- I'm not going o export my posts to spell check them- I've got things to do-

re: feedback- for a some deeper insights as to the true nature of feedback in complex systems- there is a wealth of knowledge/ theory/ and understanding contained in my post history-  feedback dynamics is one of the primary foci of my work</p></td>

a nice example of your mistake- nanotechnology has nothing to do with modern physics- as modern physics is a century old sickly sham of a field without any coherant theory- only a mess of epicycles and amendments that attempt to make the theories d'jour superficially tenable in light of almost daily refutations by evidence from the REAL universe of 3 dimensions-

here again is the mechanical thinking that leads you astray- nanotechnologist are not trying to create a system of control between agents- they are discovering how to GROW nanoecologies that allow usable eco-logic control hierarchies to NATURALLY EMERGE from the dynamics of their agents- Norbert Weiner explained all this quite eloquently half a century ago -

you continue to try and build your industrial nanobots using the religious dogma of your physics- whilst my collegues will continue to get real results and working systems through the realphysik of bioengineering and applied systems theories- I'm sure that we will continue to get all the funding [yes- UC is a money grabbing whore! :P ]</p></td>
