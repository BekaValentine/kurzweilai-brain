<h2>21<sup>st</sup> Century <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a></h2>
<p>It is always somewhat presumptuous to attempt to predict the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, 
              but in this case we are on solid ground because most of the prerequisite 
              historical processes are already in <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> and all of them appear 
              to be clearly pointing in the same direction.</p>
<p>Medical historian Roy Porter notes that the 19<sup>th</sup> century 
              saw the establishment of what we think of as scientific medicine. 
              From about the middle of that century the textbooks and the attitudes 
              they reveal are recognizable as not being very different from modern 
              ones. Before that, medical books were clearly written to address 
              a different mindset.</p>
<p>But <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> health is fundamentally <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> is fundamentally 
              molecular. As a result, throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century scientific 
              medicine began its transformation from a merely rational basis to 
              a fully molecular basis. First, <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s that interfered with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s at the molecular level were introduced. Next, the ongoing 
              revolutions in <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a>, proteomics and <a class="thought" href="entries/bioinformatics_entry.html">bioinformatics</a><sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2321" target="_blank">2321</a></sup> 
              provided detailed and precise <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the workings of the human 
              body at the molecular level. Our understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> advanced 
              from organs, to tissues, to cells, and finally to <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, in 
              the 20<sup>th</sup> century. By the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, 
              the entire human <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> will be mapped. This map will inferentially 
              incorporate a complete catalog of all human <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, lipids, carbohydrates, 
              nucleoproteins and other molecules, including full sequence, <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, 
              and much functional <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Only some <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>ic functional knowledge, 
              particularly neurological, may still be lacking by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>This deep molecular familiarity with the human body, along with 
              simultaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering advances (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/2.1.htm" target="_blank">Chapter 
              2</a>), will <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> the stage for a shift from today's molecular scientific 
              medicine in which fundamental new discoveries are constantly being 
              made, to a molecular technologic medicine in which the molecular 
              basis of life, by then well-known, is manipulated to produce specific 
              desired results. The comprehensive knowledge of human molecular 
              structure so painstakingly acquired during the 20<sup>th</sup> and 
              early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries will be used in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
              century to design medically-active microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. These machines, 
              rather than being tasked primarily with voyages of pure discovery, 
              will instead most often be sent on missions of cellular inspection, 
              repair, and reconstruction. In the coming century, the principal 
              focus will shift from medical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> to medical engineering. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a> 
              will involve designing and building a vast proliferation of incredibly 
              efficacious molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, and then deploying these devices 
              in patients to establish and maintain a continuous state of human 
              healthiness.</p>
<p>The very earliest <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-based biomedical systems may be 
              used to help resolve many difficult scientific questions that remain. 
              They may also be employed to assist in the brute-force analysis 
              of the most difficult three-dimensional structures among the 100,000-odd 
              proteins of which the human body is comprised, or to help ascertain 
              the precise function of each such protein. But much of this effort 
              should be complete within the next 20-30 years because the reference 
              human body has a finite parts list, and these parts are already 
              being sequenced, geometered and archived at an ever-increasing pace. 
              Once these parts are known, then the reference human being as a 
              biological system is at least physically specified to completeness 
              at the molecular level. Thereafter, nanotechnology-based discovery 
              will consist principally of examining a particular sick or injured 
              patient to determine how he or she deviates from molecular reference 
              structures, with the physician then interpreting these deviations 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of their possible contribution to, or detraction from, 
              the general health and the explicit preferences of the patient.</p>
<p>In brief, nanomedicine will employ molecular machine systems to 
              address medical problems, and will use molecular knowledge to maintain 
              human health at the molecular scale. </p>
<h2>Volitional Normative Model of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a></h2>
<p>What, exactly, is "medicine"? Dictionaries give several 
              definitions, ranging from the very restrictive to the most general, 
              as follows: "a drug or remedy";<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2223" target="_blank">2223</a></sup>,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2224" target="_blank">2224</a></sup>

              "the study and treatment of general diseases or those affecting 
              the internal parts of the body";<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2224" target="_blank">2224</a></sup> 
              "the science of treating disease, the healing art";<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2220" target="_blank">2220</a></sup>

              "the act of maintenance of health, and prevention and treatment

              "the department of knowledge and practice dealing with disease

              or, most generally, "the science and art of diagnosing, treating, 
              curing, and preventing disease, relieving pain, and improving and 
              preserving health".<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2221" target="_blank">2221</a></sup> 
              In this book, we shall adopt the latter, maximally-inclusive, definition 
              of "medicine"(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Figures/1.3.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              1.3</a>).</p>
<p>Reviewing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Figures/1.3.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              1.3</a>, the contemporary physician might at first be inclined to 
              relegate molecular approaches to some minor subfield, perhaps "nanoanalytics," 
              "nanogenomics," or "nanotherapeutics." This 
              would be a serious mistake, because the application of molecular 
              approaches to health care will significantly impact virtually every 
              category of laboratory and clinical practice across the board. Thus 
              we are led to the broadest possible <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of nanomedicine as 
              "the science and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of diagnosing, treating, and preventing 
              disease and traumatic injury, of relieving pain, and of preserving 
              and improving human health, using molecular tools and molecular 
              knowledge of the human body."</p>
<p>This brings us to the question of "disease," a complex 
              term whose meaning is still hotly debated among medical academics.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2225" target="_blank">2225</a>-<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2230" target="_blank">2230</a></sup>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Figures/1.4.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              1.4</a> shows the results of a survey of four different groups of 
              people who were read a list of common diagnostic terms and then 
              asked if they would rate the condition as a disease. Illnesses due 
              to microorganisms, or conditions in which the doctor's contribution 
              to the diagnosis was <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant, were most likely to be called a 
              disease, but if the cause was a known physical or chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> 
              the condition was less likely to be regarded as disease; general 
              practitioners also had the broadest definition of disease.</p>
<p>No less than eight different types of disease concepts are held 
              by at least some people currently engaging in clinical <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing 
              and practice, including:<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2226" target="_blank"><sup>2226</sup></a>,<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2227" target="_blank"><sup>2227</sup></a></p>
<p>1. <i>Disease Nominalism</i>&amp;#8212A disease is whatever physicians 
              say is a disease. This approach avoids understanding and forestalls 
              inquiry, rather than furthering it.</p>
<p>2. <i>Disease Relativism</i>&amp;#8212A disease is identified or labeled 
              in accordance with explicit or implicit social norms and values 
              at a particular time. In 19<sup>th</sup> century Japan, for example, 
              armpit odor was considered a disease and its treatment constituted 
              a medical specialty. Similarly, 19<sup>th</sup>-century Western 
              culture regarded masturbation as a disease, and in the 18<sup>th</sup> 
              century, some conveniently identified a disease called drapetomania, 
              the"abnormally strong and irrational desire of a slave to be 
              free."<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2205" target="_blank">2205</a></sup> 
              Various nonwestern cultures having widespread parasitic infection 
              may consider the lack of infection to be abnormal, thus not regarding 
              those who are infected as suffering from disease.</p>
<p>3. <i>Sociocultural Disease</i>&#8212;Societies may possess a concept 
              of disease that differs from the concepts of other societies, but 
              the concept may also differ from that held by medical practitioners 
              within the <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> itself. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, hypercholesterolemia is 
              regarded as a disease condition by doctors but not by the lay public; 
              medical treatment may be justified, but persons with hypercholesterolemia 
              may not seek treatment, even when told of the condition. Conversely, 
              there may be sociocultural pressure to recognize a particular condition 
              as a disease requiring treatment, such as alcoholism and gambling.</p>
<p>4. <i>Statistical Disease</i>&amp;#8212A condition is a disease when 
              it is abnormal, where abnormal is defined as a specific deviation 
              from a statistically-defined norm. This approach has many flaws. 
              For example, a statistical concept makes it impossible to regard 
              an entire population as having a disease. Thus tooth decay, which 
              is virtually universal in humans, is not abnormal; those lacking 
              it are abnormal, thus are "diseased" by this definition. 
              More reasonably, a future highly-aseptic society might regard bacterium-infested 
              20<sup>th</sup> century humans (who contain in their bodies more 
              foreign microbes than native cells; <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/8.5.1.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              8.5.1</a>) as massively infected. Another flaw is that many statistical 
              measurables such as body temperature and blood pressure are continuous 
              variables with bell-shaped distributions, so cutoff thresholds between 
              "normal" and "abnormal" seem highly arbitrary.</p>
<p>5. <i>Infectious Agency</i>&amp;#8212Disease is caused by a microbial 
              infectious agent. Besides excluding systemic failures of bodily 
              systems, this view is unsatisfactory because the same agent can 
              produce very different illnesses. For instance, infection with hemolytic 
              <i>Streptococcus</i> can produce diseases as different as erysipelas 
              and puerperal fever, and Epstein-Barr <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> is implicated in diseases 
              as varied as Burkitt's lymphoma, glandular fever, and naso-pharyngeal 
              carcinoma.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2227" target="_blank"><sup>2227</sup></a></p>
<p>6. <i>Disease Realism</i>&amp;#8212Diseases have a real, substantial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> regardless of social norms and values, and exist independent 
              of whether they are discovered, named, recognized, classified, or 
              diagnosed. Diseases are not <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s and may be identified with 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s of biological systems, providing a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>istic 
              account of diseases in terms of system <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s and subprocesses, 
              even down to the molecular level. One major problem with this view 
              is that theories may change over time &#8212; almost every 19<sup>th</sup> 
              century scientific theory was either rejected or highly modified 
              in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. If the identification of disease 
              is connected with theories, then a change in theories may alter 
              what is viewed as a disease. For example, the 19<sup>th</sup> century 
              obsession with constipation was reflected in the disease labeled 
              "autointoxication," in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of the large 
              bowel were believed to poison the body. Consequently much unnecessary 
              attention was paid to laxatives and purgatives and, when surgery 
              of the abdomen became possible toward the end of the century, operations 
              to remove the colon became fashionable in both England and America.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2205" target="_blank">2205</a></sup></p>
<p>7. <i>Disease Idealism</i>&amp;#8212Disease is the lack of health, 
              where health is characterized as the optimum functioning of biological 
              systems. Every real system inevitably falls short of the optimum 
              in its actual functioning. But by comparing large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of systems, 
              we can formulate standards that a particular system ought to satisfy, 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to be the best of its kind. Thus "health" becomes 
              a kind of Platonic ideal that real <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s approximate, and everyone 
              is a less than perfect physical specimen. Since we are all flawed 
              to some extent, disease is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of degree, a more or less extreme 
              variation from the normative ideal of perfect functioning. This 
              could be combined with the statistical approach, thus characterizing 
              disease as a statistical variation from the ideal. But this view, 
              like the statistical, suffers from arbitrary thresholds that must 
              be drawn to qualify a measurable function as representing a diseased 
              condition.</p>
<p>8. <i>Functional Failure</i>&#8212;Organisms and the cells that 
              constitute them are complex organized systems that display phenomena 
              (e.g. homeostasis) resulting from acting upon a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> of information. 
              Programs acquired and developed during <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, encoded in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, 
              control the processes of the system. Through biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, 
              we write out the program of a process as an explicit set (or <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>) 
              of instructions. There are completely self-contained "closed" 
              genetic programs, and there are "open" genetic programs 
              that require an interaction between the programmed system and the 
              environment, e.g. <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> or conditioning. Normal functioning is 
              thus the operation of biologically programmed processes, e.g. natural 
              functioning, and disease may be characterized as the failure of 
              normal functioning. One difficulty with this view is that it enshrines 
              the natural (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/1.3.4.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              1.3.4</a>) as the benchmark of health, but it is difficult to regard 
              as diseased a natural brunette who has dyed her hair blonde in contravention 
              of the natural program, and it is quite reasonable to regard the 
              mere possession of an appendix as a disease condition, even though 
              the natural program operates so as to perpetuate this troublesome 
              organ.*</p>
<p><font size="1">* The vermiform appendix may have some minor immune 
              function, but it is clearly nonessential and can kill when infected. 
              Yet natural selection has not eliminated it. Indeed, there is evidence 
              for positive selection due to the following accident of physiological 
              evolution. Appendicitis results when inflammation causes swelling, 
              compressing the artery supplying blood to the appendix. High bloodflow 
              protects against <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, so any reduction aids infection, 
              creating more swelling; if flow is completely cut off, bacteria 
              multiply rapidly until the organ bursts. A slender appendix is especially 
              susceptible, so untreated appendicitis applies positive selective 
              pressure to maintain a larger appendix.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2100-2199.htm#2185" target="_blank">2185</a></sup></font></p>
<p> A second weakness of this view is that disease is still defined 
              against population norms of functionality, ignoring <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> differences. 
              As a perhaps overly simplistic example, 65% of all patients employ 
              a cisterna chyli in their lower thoracic lymph duct, while 35% have 
              no cisterna chyli (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Figures/8.10.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              8.10</a>)&#8212;which group has a healthy natural program, and which 
              group is "diseased"?</p>
<p>The author proposes a ninth view of disease, a new alternative 
              which seems most suitable for the nanomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, called the 
              "volitional normative" model of disease. As in the "disease 
              idealism" view, the volitional normative model accepts the 
              premise that health is the optimal functioning of biological systems. 
              Like the "functional failure" view, the volitional normative 
              model assumes that optimal functioning involves the operation of 
              biologically programmed processes.</p>
<p>However, two important distinctions from these previous views must 
              be made. First, in the volitional normative model, normal functioning 
              is defined as the optimal operation of biologically programmed processes 
              as reflected in the patient's own individual genetic instructions, 
              rather than of those processes which might be reflected in a generalized 
              population average or "Platonic ideal" of such instructions; 
              the relative function of other members of the human population is 
              no longer determinative. Second, physical condition is regarded 
              as a volitional state, in which the patient's desires are a crucial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> in the definition of health. This is a continuation of the 
              current trend in which patients frequently see themselves as active 
              partners in their own care.</p>
<p>In the volitional normative model, disease is characterized not 
              just as the failure of "optimal" functioning, but rather 
              as the failure of either (a) "optimal" functioning or 
              (b) "desired" functioning. Thus disease may result from:</p>
<p>1. a failure to correctly specify desired bodily function (specification 
              error by the patient),</p>
<p>2. a flawed biological program design that doesn't meet the specifications 
              (programming design error),</p>
<p>3. flawed execution of the biological program (execution error),</p>
<p>4. external interference by disease agents with the design or execution 
              of the biological program (exogenous error), or</p>
<p>5. traumatic injury or accident (structural failure).</p>
<p>In the early years of nanomedicine, volitional physical states 
              will customarily reflect "default" values which may differ 
              only insignificantly from the patient's original or natural biological 
              programming. With a more mature nanomedicine, the patient may gain 
              the ability to substitute alternative natural programs for many 
              of his original natural programs. For example, the genes responsible 
              for appendix morphology or for sickle <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> might be replaced 
              with genes that encode other <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>s, such as the phenotype of 
              an appendix-free cecum or a phenotype for statistically typical 
              human erythrocytes.* </p>
<p><font size="1">* It is often pointed out that sickle cell is advantageous 
              in malaria-infested countries because the trait confers resistance 
              to malaria. This flaw-tolerant view makes a virtue of necessity&amp;#8212a 
              direct cure for malaria will undoubtedly be more efficient. Sickle 
              cell is disadvantageous in hypoxic conditions, which is why no one 
              with this trait can hold a civil airline pilot's license.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2900-2999.htm#2981" target="_blank">2227</a></sup></font></p>
<p>Many persons will go further, electing an artificial genetic structure 
              which, say, eliminates age-related diminution of the secretion of 
              human growth hormone and other essential endocrines. (The graduated 
              secretion of powerful proteolytic enzymes, perhaps targeted for 
              gene-expression in appropriate organs, may reverse and control the 
              accumulation of highly crosslinked collagenaceous debris; by 1998, 
              many members of the mainstream medical community were already starting 
              to regard aging as a treatable condition.)<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2310" target="_blank">2310</a>,<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2900-2999.htm#2976" target="_blank">2976</a>-<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2900-2999.htm#2981" target="_blank">2981</a></sup> 
              On the other hand, a congenitally blind patient might desire, for 
              whatever personal reasons, to retain his blindness. Hence his genetic 
              programs that result in the blindness phenotype would not, for him, 
              constitute "disease" as long as he fully understands the 
              options and outcomes that are available to him. (Retaining his blindness 
              while lacking such understanding might constitute a specification 
              error, and such a patient might then be considered "diseased.") 
              Whether the broad pool of volitional human phenotypes will tend 
              to converge or diverge is unknown, although the most likely outcome 
              is probably a population distribution (of human biological programs) 
              with a tall, narrow central peak (e.g., a smaller standard deviation) 
              but with longer tails (e.g., exhibiting a small number of more extreme 
              outliers).</p>
<p>One minor flaw in the volitional normative model of disease is 
              that it relies upon the ability of patients to make fully informed 
              decisions concerning their own physical state. The model crucially 
              involves desires and beliefs, which can be irrational, especially 
              during mental illness, and people normally vary in their ability 
              to acquire and digest information. Patients also may be unconscious 
              or too young, whereupon default standards might be substituted in 
              some cases.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the volitional normative view of disease appears 
              most appropriate for nanomedicine because it recognizes that the 
              era of molecular control of biology could bring considerable molecular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> among the human population. Conditions representing a 
              diseased state must of necessity become more idiosyncratic, and 
              may <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ively vary as personal preferences evolve over time. 
              Some patients will be more venturesome than others&#8212;"to 
              each his own." As an imperfect <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, consider a group of 
              individuals who each take their automobile to a mechanic. One driver 
              insists on having the carburetion and timing adjusted for maximum 
              performance (the "racer"); another driver prefers optimum 
              gas mileage (the "cheapskate"); still another prefers 
              minimizing tailpipe emissions (the "environmentalist"); 
              and yet another requires only that the engine be painted blue (the 
              "aesthete"). In like manner, different people will choose 
              different personal specifications (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/1.2.5.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              1.2.5</a>). One can only hope that the physician will never become 
              a mere mechanic even in an era of near-perfect human structural 
              and functional information; an automobile conveys a body, but the 
              human body conveys the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. Agrees theorist Guttentag:<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2234" target="_blank">2234</a></sup>

<h2>Naturophilia</h2>
<p>As already noted (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/1.3.1.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              1.3.1</a>), living things in general and the human body in particular 
              are awesome examples of a powerful and intricately woven natural 
              molecular technology to which human engineers, in 1998, still aspire. 
              But embracing <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> is not the same as finding her perfect. Today, 
              the word "natural" has acquired a strong connotation of 
              rightness, even of sanctity. For most of human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, notes biologist 
              Steven Vogel,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2000-2099.htm#2022" target="_blank">2022</a></sup> 
              "the natural and human worlds stood opposed. Nature was something 
              to be tamed and utilized; we had the ordinary attitude of organisms 
              toward other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Nowadays the natural world intrudes far less 
              but gets venerated far more. And why not? When one's meat is bought 
              in a store, when locusts don't threaten one's corn crop, when central 
              heating and plumbing are the norm, the <a class="thought" href="entries/aesthetics_entry.html">aesthetics</a> of nature hold 
              greater appeal." And so we embrace the natural rectitude or 
              moral superiority of nature's ways, a kind of pantheism which may 
              be called ethical naturalism,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2299" target="_blank">2299</a></sup>

              or naturophilia.</p>

              that "if one way be better than another, that you may be sure 
              is Nature's way." In the 15<sup>th</sup> century, we have from

              "Human ingenuity may make various inventions, but it will never

              is wanting and nothing is superfluous."</p>
<p>However, as Virginia Postrel notes in <i>The Future and Its Enemies</i>:<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2299" target="_blank">2299</a></sup> 
              "If nature is itself a dynamic process rather than a static 
              end, then there is no single form of `the natural.' An evolving, 
              open-ended nature may impose practical <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s, but it cannot 
              dictate eternal standards. It cannot determine what is good. The 
              distinction between the artificial and the natural must lie not 
              in their source&#8212;human or not&amp;#8212but in their characteristics, 
              in the way they relate to the world around them."</p>
<p>According to the dictionary, "artificial" usually means 
              "made by man, rather than occurring in nature." More usefully, 
              Herbert Simon<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2301" target="_blank">2301</a></sup>

              defines the natural as "out of control." Nature is evolved, 
              not designed, and serves no goal or external purpose save its own 
              survival. Nature, lacking intent, is amoral&#8212;it simply is.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2299" target="_blank">2299</a></sup> 
              By building the artificial, observes Postrel, "we do not overthrow 
              nature, but cooperate with it, using nature's own art to create 
              new natural forms. Our artifice alters the path of nature, but it 
              does not end it, for nature has no stopping point, no final shape. 
              It is a process, not an end."</p>
<p>Some naturophilist writers have decried the increasing "medicalization 
              of society" in which formerly natural functions have come to 
              be regarded as medical conditions requiring intervention or treatment.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2204" target="_blank">2204</a>,<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2302" target="_blank">2302</a>-<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2308" target="_blank">2308</a></sup> 
              However, history suggests that naturophilia is usually undermined 
              by any new medical technology that offers clear, safe, and immediate 
              benefits to patients. For example, prior to 1842, intense pain was 
              viewed as the natural outcome of being cut with a scalpel during 
              surgery. It had always been so&#8212;how could it ever be otherwise? 
              The invention of anesthesia in 1842 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/1.2.1.9.2.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              1.2.1.9.2</a>) suddenly altered this natural outcome and replaced 
              it with a less painful artificial outcome, despite anguished cries 
              from naturophiles within the medical community that eliminating 
              pain might somehow diminish the human character.</p>
<p>Another example of a widely-accepted medicalization of normal function 
              is childbirth, a quite natural activity that can nevertheless be 
              very dangerous to the mother's health. Precise prehistoric <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> 
              rates are unknown, although archeological evidence shows that <a class="thought" href="entries/neanderthal_entry.html">Neanderthal</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a>s tended to die before the age of 30 due to hazards of childbirth.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2339" target="_blank">2339</a>,<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2340" target="_blank">2340</a></sup> 
              In the worst 19<sup>th</sup> century maternity hospitals the natural 
              death rate from childbirth was 9-10%, falling to a very artificial 
              0.4% rate in England by 1930 and to less than 0.01% in the U.S. 
              during the 1990s. As a result, it now seems "natural" 
              for a woman always to survive childbirth, even though the reverse 
              may have been true for most of human history. Warns historian Roy 
              Porter:<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2200-2299.htm#2204" target="_blank">2204</a></sup> 
              "We should certainly not hanker after some mythic golden age 
              when women gave birth naturally, painlessly, and safely; the most 
              appalling Western maternal death rate today is among the Faith Assembly 
              religious sect in Indiana, who reject orthodox medicine and practice 
              home births; their perinatal <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> is 92 times greater than 
              in Indiana as a whole."</p>
<p>A disease seems "natural" to those who suffer from it 
              when no treatment exists. But once a treatment is discovered and 
              is widely employed, the disease becomes rare and its absence now 
              becomes "natural." To those in the past, writes K.E. Drexler,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs1-99.htm#9" target="_blank">9</a></sup> 
              "the idea of cutting people open with knives painlessly would 
              have seemed miraculous, but surgical anesthesia is now routine. 
              Likewise with bacterial infections and antibiotics, with the eradication 
              of smallpox, and the vaccine for polio: each tamed a deadly terror, 
              and each is now half-forgotten history. What amazes one generation 
              seems obvious and even boring to the next. The first baby born after 
              each breakthrough grows up wondering what all the excitement was 
              about." In the next century, says Charles Sheffield,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs300-399.htm#343" target="_blank">343</a></sup> 
              "our descendants will look on angiograms, upper and lower GIs, 
              and biopsies the way we regard the prospect of surgery without anesthetics."</p>
<p>Future generations who take for granted an all-pervasive nanomedicine 
              in their lives may look aghast upon the 20<sup>th</sup> century, 
              wondering among other things how we managed to retain productive 
              focus given the constant annoyance of our numerous undiagnosed minor 
              disease states. Most of these diseases are not yet recognized as 
              such, and many are still regarded as "natural" and not 
              worthy of treatment. In a few decades, this may change. Some examples:</p>
<p>1. <i>Addictions</i>&#8212;In 1998, many people laugh off seemingly 
              harmless addictions to chocolate (chocoholics), fats or sugar (sweet 
              tooth), food (gluttony), nicotine (smokers), caffeine (coffee and 
              cola drinkers), work (workaholics), exercise (runner's high), telling 
              falsehoods (pathological liars), gambling (wagerphilia), stealing 
              (kleptomania), medical treatments (hypochondria), marriage (polygamy), 
              power-seeking (domination), skydiving or bungee-jumping (thrillseeking), 
              superstition (astrology), shopping (spendoholics), driving cars 
              that kill 40,000 Americans per year (mobilophilia), unusual sexual 
              preferences (bestiality), sexual activity (nymphomania, satyriasis), 
              or pregnancy (gravidophilia). Without making any value judgements, 
              it is highly likely that most or all of these addictions have genetic 
              or physiological components which, once properly modified, can greatly 
              reduce or eliminate the addiction if so desired. Many on the list 
              are already suspected to have genetic components, much like schizophrenia, 
              drug abuse, bulimia, and alcoholism (dipsomania).</p>
<p>2. <i>Allergies and Intolerances</i>&amp;#8212A food allergy<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2900-2999.htm#2997" target="_blank">2997</a></sup> 
              is an allergic reaction to a particular food, although true food 
              allergies are much rarer than is generally believed.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs1600-1699.htm#1604" target="_blank">1604</a></sup> 
              In the cases of milk, eggs, shellfish, nuts, wheat, soybeans, and 
              chocolate, sufferers may lack an enzyme necessary for digesting 
              the substance. In other cases, dust <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, plant pollens, pet 
              danders, drugs, or foods may be allergens for natural IgE-mediated 
              immunosensitivity. Intolerance, a much more common condition, is 
              any undesirable effect of eating a particular food, including gastrointestinal 
              distress, gas, nausea, diarrhea, or other problems. Urticaria (hives), 
              angioedema and even mild anaphylaxis are common reactions to various 
              drugs, <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> stings or bites, allergy shots, or certain foods, 
              particularly eggs, shellfish, nuts and fruits. Physical allergies 
              to ordinary stimuli such as cold, sunlight, heat, pollen, pet dander, 
              or minor injury can produce itching, skin blotches, pimples, and 
              hives.</p>
<p>3. <i>Minor Physical Annoyances</i>&#8212;In a world where most 
              major medical maladies are readily treated, numerous minor medical 
              conditions which today escape our notice will rise up from obscurity 
              and present themselves annoyingly to our conscious minds, demanding 
              attention. These conditions may be of several kinds. First is cosmetics, 
              including small moles, freckles and blemishes on the skin; broken 
              fingernails or unevenly-growing cuticles; minor skin reddenings 
              or pimples; old childhood scars, wrinkled skin, birthmarks or stretch 
              marks; unwanted hair growth in unusual places, or differential hair 
              color or texture growing in patches; fingerprint <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s that are 
              aesthetically unappealing; and mismatched leg lengths, hands with 
              different left/right ring sizes, an asymmetrical face, or lopsided 
              breasts. Second is minor aches and pains, which may include headaches; 
              eyebrow hairs trapped in the eyeball conjunctiva; bent-hair pain 
              (folliculalgia); dyspepsia; creaking limb joints and stomach growling; 
              ingrown nails and hairs; earwax plugs and temporary tinnitis; chapped 
              lips, canker sores and heat rashes; stuffy nose or gritty eyes upon 
              rising in the morning; dermal chafing marks from elastic bands in 
              clothing; minor flatulence; PMS (premenstrual syndrome); a leg or 
              arm "falling asleep" in certain postures; nervous tics, 
              itches, and twitches; uncracked knuckles, stiff neck, or backache; 
              blocked middle ear following descent from high altitude; restless 
              leg syndrome (akathisia); rotationally-induced dizziness, as on 
              an amusement park ride; or rock-and-roll neck, wherein active musical 
              performers or listeners bob their heads violently, rupturing small 
              blood vessels in the neck. Third is minor physical or functional 
              flaws, such as poor stream during <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> urination, female papillary 
              leakage, colorblindness, snoring, unpleasant body odors, nosebleeds, 
              declining visual or aural acuity, handedness (currently ~90% dextromanual, 
              ~10% sinistromanual,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs3100-3199.htm#3136" target="_blank">3136</a>,<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs3100-3199.htm#3137" target="_blank">3137</a></sup> 
              mild strabismus (eyeball misalignment), bad moods (<a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> 
              imbalances), or post-intoxication hangover.</p>
<p>4. <i>Undiscovered Infectious Agents</i>&#8212;Peptic ulcers once 
              were <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to result from a stressful life, a purely natural response 
              to a lifestyle choice. Then it was found that the major cause of 
              ulcers is the presence of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> bacteria in 
              the stomach. Bacteria have been implicated in some cases of atherosclerosis<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2900-2999.htm#2970" target="_blank">2970</a></sup>

              and nanobacteria have been proposed as possible nucleation sites 
              for kidney stones.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2100-2199.htm#2149" target="_blank">2149</a></sup> 
              Other seemingly natural but undesirable conditions may also be due 
              to undiscovered microbial agents,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs3200-3299.htm#3237" target="_blank">3237</a></sup> 
              especially since bacteria outnumber tissue cells in our highly infested 
              20<sup>th</sup> century bodies by more than 10:1 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/8.5.1.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              8.5.1</a>).</p>
<p>5. <i>Unwanted Syndromes</i>&#8212;Syndromes are groups of related 
              symptoms and signs of disordered function that define a disease 
              whose cause remains unknown, that is, idiopathic. A good example 
              is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which affects up to 20% of the 
              adult U.S. population and includes symptoms of abdominal distention 
              and pain, with more frequent and looser stools. Many are unaware 
              they are afflicted. In 1998 there was no known cause or simple complete 
              treatment for this still "natural" disease.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs3700-3799.htm#3713" target="_blank">3713</a>-<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs3700-3799.htm#3717" target="_blank">3717</a></sup> 
              Even more mysterious than IBS is our general activity level&#8212;some 
              people seem to have high-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> personalities, while others have 
              more phlegmatic low-energy personalities. Either may be regarded 
              as "natural," but nanomedicine can probably bring this 
              ill-defined neurophysiological variable under human control. The 
              need to sleep is another imperfectly understood syndrome. It is 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d by everyone and thus was universally regarded as "natural" 
              in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Physiological short sleepers<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2100-2199.htm#2122" target="_blank">2122</a></sup> 
              were unusual, insomnia or asomnia<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs3200-3299.htm#3273" target="_blank">3273</a></sup> 
              was thought of as an abnormal state, and there were a few anecdotal 
              but medically undocumented instances of total nonsomnia, such as 
              the celebrated case of Al Herpin.<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2300-2399.htm#2312" target="_blank">2312</a></sup></p>
<p>6. <i>Psychological Traits</i>&#8212;Psychological traits which, 
              if identified by a patient as undesirable, might be subject to genetic 
              or physiological modification could include: sexual preference (6-10% 
              of the adult population is homosexual);<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs1600-1699.htm#1604" target="_blank">1604</a></sup>

              theistic or atheistic orientation; loquacity or dourness; childhood 
              imprinting; criminal propensity (up to 1-5% of the population); 
              various recognized personality disorders that affect ~10% of the 
              population<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2100-2199.htm#2122" target="_blank">2122</a></sup> 
              such as antisocial, paranoid, schizotypal, histrionic, narcissistic, 
              avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, and passive-aggressive 
              disorders; panic attacks (experienced at least once by ~33% of all

              ~10%), the dark (noctiphobia or scotophobia), or strangers (xenophobia) 
              (total ~5.7%), the fear of blood or hemophobia (~5%), agoraphobia

              girls (parthenophobia), men (androphobia), stars in the sky (siderophobia), 
              the number thirteen (triskaidekaphobia), and even the fear of developing 
              a phobia (phobophobia).</p>
<p>The above sampling of minor afflictions, almost all considered 
              "natural" in 1998, may come to be regarded as commonplace 
              correctable medical conditions in the nanomedical era. By the time 
              such petty annoyances are deemed worthy of immediate treatment,

              Naturophiles may dissent, but the emerging trend from medical biotechnology 
              is to characterize health, not as a static standard, but rather 
              as a condition defined by the lives that people want to lead. Affirming 
              the volitional normative model of disease (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/1.2.2.htm" target="_blank">Section

<h2>Changing View of the Human Body</h2>
<p>How does a patient regard his or her own body, and how might this 
              most intimate of all relationships change in the nanomedical era? 
              The so-called dualist theory of the human compound, as originally 
              developed by Descartes and widely accepted today by the ordinary 
              person, holds that the human being consists of two separate kinds 
              of thing: the body and the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> or soul. The body acts as a host 
              or receptacle for the mind. The mind, often called "the ghost 
              in the machine," is manifested by the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which it uses 
              (via the bodily senses) to acquire and store information about the 
              world and to integrate this with its genetically-driven imperative 
              to live, thus resolving internal conflicts among <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>-choices 
              and expressing these in what we (in our <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>) experience 
              as decisive action.</p>
<p>Scientific medicine has concentrated primarily on the body. The 
              ancient Roman physician Galen first dissected and vivisected a variety 
              of animals to increase his knowledge of anatomy and <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a>, 
              and dissection became increasingly important in the training of 
              physicians and surgeons, and in painting and sculpture, during the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">Renaissance</a>. By the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, dissection had 
              reached the molecular level, with the insides of the human cell 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> being taken apart and examined by molecular biologists, 
              literally receptor by receptor. Dissection and the mechanistic understanding 
              it provides have led some to decry what they regard as the modern 
              "soulless" view of the human body as a mere machine.</p>
<p>In the nanomedical era, even the most diehard reductionist must 
              come to see the human body not merely as a heap of parts but rather 
              as a finely tuned vehicle that is owned and piloted by a single 
              human mind. As with automobiles, some body-owners will be more diligent 
              about maintenance, regular tuneups, and paint jobs than other body-owners. 
              Some will crave the latest upgrades, while others may prefer a more 
              conservative model that reliably gets them around town. At either 
              extreme, all human vices and virtues will be on full display, though 
              one may perhaps anticipate an increasing pride of corporeal ownership 
              if for no other reason than because maintenance and repair will 
              become quick, convenient, and inexpensive.</p>
<p>From this simple analogy of body-and-mind to car-and-driver, it 
              might at first appear that the advent of nanomedical technology 
              will confirm and strengthen the traditional dualist conception of 
              the body. But closer inspection reveals that the analogy is at best 
              incomplete, and at worst deeply flawed. This is because mind, first 
              being necessarily embedded in physical structure and relying upon 
              that structure for its faithful execution, and second, this physical 
              structure now being manipulable at the molecular level, enters also 
              into the purview of our mechanic. Both car and driver may be modified 
              in the shop. Speaking allegorically, it is as if the driver, after 
              getting his car a tuneup, emerges from the shop no longer favoring 
              chocolate but enjoying vanilla instead, or now preferring jazz over 
              classical, the opposite of before. Such psychological changes may 
              be either volitional or emergent.</p>
<p>Until the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, human progress was measured 
              almost exclusively in terms of externalities. Food was gathered, 
              then sown, then manufactured. Shelters had no running water, then 
              gained outhouses, then indoor plumbing. Natural lighting and campfires 
              gave way to candles, then oil lamps, then electric illumination. 
              Finger-counting yielded first to the <a class="thought" href="entries/abacus_entry.html">abacus</a>, then the mechanical 
              adding machine, and finally to the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. But throughout 
              all of history, the human body itself has remained largely untouched 
              by progress. We have always regarded our bodies, evolved by natural 
              selection, as fundamentally inviolate and immutable&#8212;subject 
              perhaps to various natural or traumatic degradations, but rarely 
              to any significant intrinsic improvement on the timescale of human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>.</p>
<p>Now we are set to embark upon an era in which our natural physiological 
              equipment may for the first time in history become capable of being 
              altered, improved, augmented, or rendered more comfortable or convenient, 
              due to advances in medical technology. The physical human body may 
              be one of the last bastions of "naturalness" (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/1.3.4.htm" target="_blank">Section 
              1.3.4</a>). It will also be one of the last elements in our common 
              worldview to be modernized.</p>
<p>Our <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> will shift by subtle degrees. 
              For instance, all <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive information about our physical surroundings 
              has traditionally arrived in the conscious mind via the various 
              natural senses such as hearing, sight, and smell. In the nanomedical 
              era, machine-mediated sensory modalities may permit direct <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> 
              of physical phenomena well removed from our bodies in both time 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, or which are qualitatively or quantitatively inaccessible 
              to our original natural senses. Perception will gradually expand 
              to incorporate nonphysical phenomena including abstract models of 
              mental <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, purely artificial constructs of simulated or enhanced 
              realities,<sup><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925111331/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Refs2900-2999.htm#2991" target="_blank">2991</a></sup> 
              and even the mental states of others. Such new perceptions will 
              inevitably alter the way our minds process information.</p>
<p>But the winds of change will sweep deeper still, into our very 
              souls. Like ants oblivious to the collective purpose of their colony, 
              the billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the human brain are all busily buzzing, 
              wholly ignorant of the emergent plan. This is the physical, mechanical 
              world of our electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. People also have thoughts, 
              feelings, <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, and volitions, a higher level in the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> processing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> which in turn is equally oblivious of the brain cells. 
              We can happily think while being totally unaware of any help from 
              our neurons. But nanomedicine will give us unprecedented systemic 
              multilevel <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to our internal physical and mental states, including 
              real-time operating <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s of our own organs, tissues, and cells, 
              and, if desired, the activities of small groups of (or even individual) 
              neurons. Diverse parts of our selves previously closed to our attention 
              may slowly conjoin and enter our conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Will this access promote an integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> or lead to hopeless 
              confusion, or worse? <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, in his collection of essays

              persuasively argues that our selves or identities are in fact networks 
              of semiautonomous neurological "agencies" which sometimes 
              cooperate and sometimes compete with one another. We think of ourselves 
              as singular "persons," but we also experience "conflicting 
              desires" and "differing viewpoints" within our minds 
              that are, in Minsky's view, a direct experience of the multiplicity

<p>More seriously, most of us suppose that we are endowed with free

              of neurological subsystems, and we become consciously aware of those 
              subsystems and are able to intervene in their processes, do we run 
              the risk of runaway instabilities at the deepest levels of what 
              we presently call our "minds"? Will we find that these

              to ourselves" in ways that we can only vaguely speculate about 
              at present. Along with any other dangers we might encounter, this 
              will raise entirely new issues of the proper role of psychotherapy

              abuse by unscrupulous third parties and also to forestall accidental 
              or volitional alterations that could render the patient a significant

Also, If you want to discover how the human body reacts to 'Nanobots' in the body, you might be able to get technical insights into that by studying the many cases of Asbestos-poisoning of the lungs, as the mostly-silicon Asbestos fibers could be a physical simulation of Nanobots. (NOTE: I have pesteed nearly every place on the web with the technical recommendation that somebody in NASA or dARPA, who worked with EMPs, Electro-Magnetic Pulses in the folded 'Star Wars' SDI program to use EMPs to disintegrate the SILICON electronic components of incoming missiles, adapt their EMP hardware to make a medical treamtnet system to shoot special EMPs into the chests of Asbestos, Blacklung, and Silicosis lung patients, while passing an EMP-synched electrostatic current through their chests, to SELECTIVELY dissolve the inoperably-enlodged silicon fibers into stray molecules that their lungs can cough up or white cells eliminate, But nobody ever bothered to reply, Please spread that idea around,OK? Thanks.)Also, it's possible that advances in genetic manipulation might create living 'Nanobots', like a new type of protozoia that doctors could inject into everyone's bloodstream,to eat up all the bad cholesteriol or plaque or blood clots that would normally incrent in our heart vessels. Still, I wouldn't worry about the prospect of Nanotechnology making us live forever, be immortal, beause I think that although we might come up with medical science approaches to technically prolong our lives, we must keep in mind that we will only live 180-200 years ANYWAY, because by that time, as a statistical constant, accidents, diseases, acts of God or natural catastrophes, violence and suicide will simply overtake us. We may be able to close a door against death, but there's a lot of doors Nanotechnology will never close. That covers it. Again, you GOT to have all medical students read this thing!</p></td>
