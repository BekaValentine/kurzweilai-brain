<br><blockquote>London, April 1773.</blockquote>
<blockquote>To Jacques Dubourg.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Your observations on the causes of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, and the experiments which you propose for recalling to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> those who appear to be killed by lightning, demonstrate equally your sagacity and your humanity. It appears that the doctrine of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in general is yet but little understood... &#160;&#160;I wish it were possible... to invent a method of embalming drowned persons, in such a manner that they might be recalled to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> at any period, however distant; for having a very ardent desire to see and observe the state of America a hundred years hence, I should prefer to an ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, being immersed with a few friends in a cask of Madeira, until that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, then to be recalled to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> by the solar warmth of my dear country! But... in all probability, we live in a century too little advanced, and too near the infancy of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, to see such an <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> brought in our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to its perfection...</blockquote>
<blockquote>I am, etc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>- B. FRANKLIN.</blockquote>
<p>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN wanted a procedure for stopping and restarting metabolism, but none was then known. Do we live in a century far enough advanced to make <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> available - to open a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of health to patients who would otherwise lack any choice but dissolution after they have expired?</p>
<p>&#160;We can stop metabolism in many ways, but <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>, to be of use, must be reversible. This leads to a curious situation. Whether we can place patients in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> using <i>present</i> techniques depends entirely on whether <i><a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a></i> techniques will be able to reverse the process. The procedure has two parts, of which we must master only one.</p>
<p>&#160;If <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> can keep a patient unchanged for years, then those <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> techniques will include sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. We must therefore judge the success of present <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> procedures in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of the ultimate abilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. Before <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s became a clear prospect, those abilities - and thus the requirements for successful <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> - remained grossly uncertain. Now, the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> requirements seem fairly obvious.</p><h1>The Requirements for <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a></h1><p>Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can build cells from scratch, as dividing cells demonstrate. They can also build organs and organ <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s from scratch, as developing <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s demonstrate. Physicians will be able to use <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to direct the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of new organs from a patient's own cells. This gives modern physicians great leeway in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> procedures: even if they were to damage or discard most of a patient s organs, they would still do no irreversible harm. <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> colleagues with better tools will be able to repair or replace the organs involved. Most people would be glad to have a new heart, fresh kidneys, or younger skin.</p>
<p>&#160;But the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is another <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. A physician who allows the destruction of a patient's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> allows the destruction of the patient as a person, whatever may happen to the rest of the body. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> holds the patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, of personality, of self. Stroke patients lose only parts of their brains, yet suffer harm ranging from partial blindness to paralysis to loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, lowered <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, altered personality, and worse. The effects depend on the location of the damage. This suggests that total destruction of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> causes total blindness, paralysis, speechlessness, and mindlessness, whether the body continues to breathe or not.</p>
<p>&#160;As Voltaire wrote, "To rise again - to be the same person that you were - you must have your <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> perfectly fresh and present; for it is <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> that makes your <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>. If your <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> be lost, how will you be the same man?" Anesthesia interrupts <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> without disrupting the structure of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> procedures must do likewise, for a longer <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. This raises the question of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the physical structures that underlie <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and personality.</p>
<p>&#160;Neurobiology, and informed <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, agree on the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. As we form memories and develop as individuals, our brains change. These changes affect the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s function, changing its pattern of activity: When we remember, our brains <i>do</i> something; when we act, think, or feel, our brains <i>do</i> something. Brains work by means of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. Lasting changes in <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> function involve lasting changes in this molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry - unlike a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not designed to be wiped clean and refilled at a moment's notice. Personality and long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> are durable.</p>
<p>&#160;Throughout the body, durable changes in function involve durable changes in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. When muscles become stronger or swifter, their <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s change in number and distribution. When a liver adapts to cope with alcohol, its <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> also changes. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> learns to recognize a new kind of influenza <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> changes again. Since <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s do the actual work of moving muscles, breaking down toxins, and recognizing viruses, this relationship is to be expected.</p>
<p>&#160;In the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s shape <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells, stud their surfaces, link one <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> to the next, control the ionic currents of each neural impulse, produce the signal <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells use to communicate across <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s, and much, much more. When <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>s print words, they put down patterns of ink; when <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells change their behavior, they change their patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. Printing also dents the paper, and <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells change more than just their <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, yet the ink on the paper and the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are enough to make these patterns clear. The changes involved are far from subtle. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers report that long-term changes in <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> behavior involve "striking morphological changes" in <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s: they change visibly in size and structure.</p>
<p>&#160;It seems that long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is not some terribly delicate pattern, ready to evaporate from the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> at any excuse. <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> and personality are instead firmly embodied in the way that <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cells have grown together, in patterns formed through years of experience. <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> and personality are no more material than the characters in a novel; yet like them they are embodied in <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> and personality do not waft away on the last breath as a patient expires. Indeed, many patients have recovered from so-called "clinical <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>," even without <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to help. The patterns of mind are destroyed only when and if the attending physicians allow the patient's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to undergo dissolution. This again allows physicians considerable leeway in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> procedures: typically, they need not stop metabolism until after vital functions have ceased. &#160;</p>
<p>It seems that preserving the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures and <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> patterns of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will also preserve the structure of the mind and self. Biologists already know how to preserve tissue this well. Resuscitation <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> must await <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> seems well in hand.</p><h1>Methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a></h1><p>The idea that we already have <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> techniques may seem surprising, since powerful new abilities seldom spring up overnight. In fact, the techniques are old - only understanding of their reversibility is new. Biologists developed the two main approaches for other <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;For decades, biologists have used <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> microscopes to study the structure of cells and tissues. To prepare specimens, they use a chemical process called <i>fixation</i> to hold molecular structures in place. A popular method uses glutaraldehyde <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, flexible chains of five <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms with a reactive group of <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> atoms at each end. Biologists fix tissue by pumping a glutaraldehyde solution through blood vessels, which allows glutaraldehyde <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to diffuse into cells. A <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> tumbles around inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> until one end contacts a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> (or other reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>) and bonds to it. The other end then waves free until it, too, contacts something reactive. This commonly shackles a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> to a neighboring <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;These cross-links lock molecular structures and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in place; other chemicals then can be added to do a more thorough or sturdy job. <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">Electron</a> microscopy shows that such fixation procedures preserve cells and the structures within them, including the cells and structures of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;The first step of the hypothetical <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> procedure that I described in Chapter 7 involved simple molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s able to enter cells, block their molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, and tie structures together with stabilizing cross-links. Glutaraldehyde <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s fit this description quite well. The next step in this procedure involved other molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s able to displace water and pack themselves solidly around the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s of a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. This also corresponds to a known process.</p>
<p>&#160;Chemicals such as propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and dimethyl sulfoxide can diffuse into cells, replacing much of their water yet doing little harm. They are known as - cryoprotectants," because they can protect cells from damage at low temperatures. If they replace enough of a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s water, then cooling doesn't cause freezing, it just causes the protectant solution to become more and more viscous, going from a liquid that resembles thin syrup in its consistency to one that resembles hot tar, to one that resembles cold tar, to one as resistant to flow as a glass. In fact, according to the scientific definition of the term, the protectant solution then qualifies as a glass; the process of solidification without freezing is called vitrification. <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">Mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s vitrified and stored in liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> have grown into healthy mice.</p>
<p>&#160;The vitrification process packs the glassy protectant solidly around the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s of each cell; vitrification thus fits the description I gave of the second stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Fixation and vitrification together seem adequate to ensure long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. To reverse this form of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to remove the glassy protectant and the glutaraldehyde cross-links and then repair and replace <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, thus restoring cells, tissues, and organs to working <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Fixation with vitrification is not the first procedure proposed for <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. In 1962 Robert Ettinger, a professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> at Highland Park College in Michigan, published a book suggesting that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> advances in cryobiology might lead to techniques for the easily reversible freezing of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> patients. He further suggested that physicians using <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> might be able to repair and revive patients frozen with present techniques shortly after cessation of vital signs. He pointed out that liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> temperatures will preserve patients for centuries, if need be, with little change. Perhaps, he suggested, medical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> will one day have fabulous <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s able to restore frozen tissue a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. His book gave rise to the <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> movement.</p>
<p>&#160;Cryonicists have focused on freezing because many <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells revive <i>spontaneously</i> after careful freezing and thawing. It is a common myth that freezing bursts cells; in fact, freezing damage is more subtle than this - so subtle that it often does no lasting harm. Frozen sperm regularly produces healthy babies. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings now alive have survived being frozen solid at liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> temperatures - when they were early <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s. Cryobiologists are actively <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ing ways to freeze and thaw viable organs to allow surgeons to store them for later implantation.</p>
<p>&#160;The prospect of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair technologies has been a consistent theme among cryonicists. Still, they have tended to focus on procedures that preserve <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> function, for natural <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. Cryobiologists have kept viable <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells frozen for years. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers have improved their results by experimenting with mixes of cryoprotective chemicals and carefully controlled cooling and warming rates. The complexities of cryobiology offer rich possibilities for further experimentation. This combination of tangible, tantalizing success and promising targets for further <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> has made the quest for an easily reversible freezing process a vivid and attractive goal for cryonicists. A success at freezing and reviving an adult <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a> would be immediately visible and persuasive.</p>
<p>&#160;What is more, even <i>partial</i> preservation of tissue function suggests <i>excellent</i> preservation of tissue structure. Cells that can revive (or almost revive) even without special help will need little repair.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> community's cautious, conservative emphasis on preserving tissue function has invited public confusion, though. Experimenters have frozen whole adult <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s and thawed them without waiting for the aid of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. The results have been superficially discouraging: the <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s fail to revive. To a public and a medical community that has known nothing about the prospects for <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair, this has made frozen <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> seem pointless.</p>
<p>&#160;And, after Ettinger's proposal, a few cryobiologists chose to make unsupported pronouncements about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. As Robert Prehoda stated in a 1967 book: "Almost all reduced-metabolism experts . . . believe that cellular damage caused by current freezing techniques could never be corrected." Of course, these were the wrong experts to ask. The question called for experts on molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. These cryobiologists should have said only that correcting freezing damage would apparently require molecular-level repairs, and that they, personally, had not studied the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Instead, they casually misled the public on a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of vital medical importance. Their statements discouraged the use of a workable <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> technique.</p>
<p>&#160;Cells are mostly water. At low enough temperatures, water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s join to form a weak but solid framework of cross-links. Since this preserves neural structures and thus the patterns of mind and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, Robert Ettinger has apparently identified a workable approach to <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. As molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> advances and people grow familiar with its consequences, the reversibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> (whether based on freezing, fixation and vitrification, or other methods) will grow ever more obvious to ever more people.</p><h1>Reversing <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a></h1><p>Imagine that a patient has expired because of a heart attack. Physicians attempt resuscitation but fail, and give up on restoring vital functions. At this point, though, the patient's body and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are just <i>barely</i> nonfunctional - most cells and tissues, in fact, are still alive and metabolizing. Having made arrangements beforehand, the patient is soon placed in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> to prevent irreversible dissolution and await a better day.</p>
<p>&#160;Years pass. The patient changes little, but <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> advances greatly. Biochemists learn to design <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers use <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to build <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, then use <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s to build a broad-based <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. With new <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> explodes. Biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers use new <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of growing sophistication. They learn to stop and reverse aging. Physicians use <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to resuscitate patients in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> - first those placed in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> by the most advanced techniques, then those placed in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> using earlier and cruder techniques. Finally, after the successful resuscitation of <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s placed in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> using the old techniques of the 1980s, physicians turn to our heart-attack patient.</p>
<p>&#160;In the first stage of preparation, the patient lies in a tank of liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> surrounded by equipment. Glassy protectant still locks each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry in a firm embrace. This protectant must be removed, but simple warming might allow some <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures to move about prematurely.</p>
<p>&#160;Surgical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s designed for use at low temperatures reach through the liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> to the patient's chest. There they remove solid plugs of tissue to open <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to major arteries and veins. An army of nanomachines equipped for removing protectant moves through these openings, clearing first the major blood vessels and then the capillaries. This opens paths throughout the normally active tissues of the patient's body. The larger surgical <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s then attach tubes to the chest and pump fluid through the circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The fluid washes out the initial protectant-removal <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (later, it supplies materials to repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and carries away waste heat).</p>
<p>&#160;Now the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s pump in a milky fluid containing trillions of <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that enter cells and remove the glassy protectant, <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. They replace it with a temporary molecular scaffolding that leaves ample room for repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to work. As these protectant-removal <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s uncover biomolecules, including the structural and mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of the cells, they bind them to the scaffolding with temporary cross-links. (If the patient had also been treated with a cross-linking fixative, these cross-links would now be removed and replaced with the temporary links.) When <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s must be moved aside, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s label them for proper replacement. Like other advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, these <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s work under the direction of on-site nanocomputers.</p>
<p>&#160;When they finish, the low-temperature <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s withdraw. Through a series of gradual changes in composition and temperature, a water-based solution replaces the earlier cryogenic fluid and the patient warms to above the freezing point. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are pumped through the blood vessels and enter the cells. Repairs commence.</p>
<p>&#160;Small <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s examine <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and report their structures and positions to a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> within the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> identifies the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, directs any needed molecular repairs, and identifies <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> structures from molecular patterns. Where damage has displaced structures in a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> directs the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to restore the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to their proper arrangement, using temporary cross-links as needed. Meanwhile, the patient's arteries are cleared and the heart muscle, damaged years earlier, is repaired.</p>
<p>&#160;Finally, the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of the cells has been restored to working <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, and coarser repairs have corrected damaged patterns of cells to restore tissues and organs to a healthy condition. The scaffolding is then removed from the cells, together with most of the temporary cross-links and much of the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. Most of each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s active <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s remain blocked, though, to prevent premature, unbalanced activity.</p>
<p>&#160;Outside the body, the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has grown fresh blood from the patient's own cells. It now transfuses this blood to refill the circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, and acts as a temporary artificial heart. The remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s in each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> now adjust the concentration of salts, sugars, <a class="thought" href="entries/atp_entry.html">ATP</a>, and other small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, largely by selectively unblocking each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s own nanomachinery. With further unblocking, metabolism resumes step by step; the heart muscle is finally unblocked on the verge of contraction. Heartbeat resumes, and the patient emerges into a state of anesthesia. While the attending physicians check that all is going well, the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> closes the opening in the chest, joining tissue to tissue without a stitch or a scar. The remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s in the cells disassemble one another into harmless waste or nutrient <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. As the patient moves into ordinary sleep, certain visitors enter the room, as long planned.</p>
<p>&#160;At last, the sleeper wakes refreshed to the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of a new day - and to the sight of old friends.</p><h1>Mind, Body, &amp; <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a></h1><p>Before considering resuscitation, however, some may ask what becomes of the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> of a person in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. Some people would answer that the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> and the mind are aspects of the same thing, of a pattern embodied in the substance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, active during active <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and quiescent in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. Assume, though, that the pattern of mind, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and personality leaves the body at <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, carried by some subtle substance. The possibilities then seem fairly clear. <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> in this case has a meaning other than irreversible damage to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, being defined instead by the irreversible departure of the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. This would make <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> a pointless but harmless gesture - after all, religious leaders have expressed no concern that mere preservation of the body can somehow imprison a <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. Resuscitation would, in this view, presumably require the cooperation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> to succeed. The act of placing patients in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> has in fact been accompanied by both Catholic and Jewish ceremonies. &#160;</p>
<p>With or without <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair cannot bring <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. Physical <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, however greatly postponed, will remain inevitable for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s rooted in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a> followed by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair thus seems to raise no fundamental theology. It resembles deep anesthesia followed by <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-saving surgery: both procedures interrupt <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> to prolong <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. To speak of "<a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>" when the prospect is only long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> would be to ignore the facts or to misuse words.</p><h1>Reactions &amp; Arguments</h1><p>The prospect of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> seems tailor-made to cause <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> shock. Most people find today's accelerating change shocking enough when it arrives a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> option is a present-day consequence of a whole series of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> breakthroughs. This prospect naturally upsets the difficult psychological adjustments that people make in dealing with physical decline. &#160;</p>
<p>Thus far, I have built the case for <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair and <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> on a discussion of the commonplace facts of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>. But what do professional biologists think about the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> issues? In particular, do they believe (1) that repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to correct the kind of cross-linking damage produced by fixation, and (2) that <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is indeed embodied in a preservable form? &#160;</p>
<p>After a discussion of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and their capabilities - a discussion not touching on medical implications - Dr. Gene Brown, professor of biochemistry and chairman of the department of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> at MIT, gave permission to be quoted as stating that: "Given sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and effort to develop artificial molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and to conduct detailed studies of the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, very broad abilities should emerge. Among these could be the ability to separate the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s (or other biomolecules) in cross-linked structures, and to identify, repair, and replace them." This statement addresses a significant part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair problem. It was consistently endorsed by a sample of biochemists and molecular biologists at MIT and Harvard after similar discussions. &#160;</p>
<p>After a discussion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and personality - again, a discussion not touching on medical implications - Dr. Walle Nauta (Institute Professor of Neuroanatomy at MIT) gave permission to be quoted as stating that: "Based on our present <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, I think most would agree that the changes produced during the consolidation of long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> are reflected in corresponding changes in the number and distribution of different <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>." Like Dr. Brown's statement, this addresses a key point regarding the workability of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. It, too, was consistently endorsed by other experts when discussed in a <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> that insulated the experts from any <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al bias that might result from the medical implications of the statement. Further, since these points relate directly to their specialties, Dr. Brown and Dr. Nauta were appropriate experts to ask. &#160;</p>
<p>It seems that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> urge to live will incline many millions of people toward using <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> (as a last resort) tf they consider it workable. As molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> advances, understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair will spread through the popular culture. Expert opinion will increasingly support the idea. <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a> will grow more common, and its costs will fall. It seems likely that many people will eventually consider <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> to be the norm, to be a standard lifesaving treatment for patients who have expired.</p>
<p>&#160;But until <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are demonstrated, the all too <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tendency to ignore what we haven't seen will slow the acceptance of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. Millions will no doubt pass from expiration to irreversible dissolution because of habit and tradition, supported by weak arguments. The importance of clear foresight in this <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> makes it important to consider possible arguments before leaving the topic of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> and moving on to other <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s. Why, then, might <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> <i>not</i> seem a natural, obvious idea?</p>
<p>Because <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s aren't here yet.</p>
<p>It may seem strange to save a person from dissolution in the expectation of restoring health, since the repair <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> doesn't exist yet. But is this so much stranger than saving money to put a child through college? After all, the college student doesn't exist yet, either. Saving money makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> because the child will mature; saving a person makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> because molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will mature.</p>
<p>&#160;We expect a child to mature because we have seen many children mature; we can expect this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to mature because we have seen many technologies mature. True, some children suffer from congenital shortcomings, as do some technologies, but experts often can estimate the potential of children or technologies while they remain young.</p>
<p>&#160;Microelectronic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> started with a few spots and wires on a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, but grew into <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on chips. Physicists such as <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> saw, in part, how far it would lead.</p>
<p>&#160;Nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> started with a few atoms splitting in the laboratory under <a class="thought" href="entries/neutron_entry.html">neutron</a> bombardment, but grew into billion-watt reactors and nuclear bombs. Leo Szilard saw, in part, how far it would lead.</p>
<p>&#160;Liquid rocket <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> started with crude rockets launched from a Massachusetts field, but grew into Moonships and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttles. Robert Goddard saw, in part, how far it would lead. &#160;</p>
<p>Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering has started with ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s borrowed from cells, but it, too, will grow mighty. It, too, has discernible consequences.</p>
<p>Because tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s lack drama.</p>
<p>We tend to expect dramatic results only from dramatic causes, but the world often fails to cooperate. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> delivers both triumph and disaster in brown paper wrappers.</p>
<p>&#160;DULL FACT: Certain electric <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es can turn one another on and off. These <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es can be made very small, and frugal of electricity. &#160;THE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCE: When properly connected, these <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es form <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> revolution.</p>
<p>&#160;DULL FACT: Ether is not too poisonous, yet temporarily interferes with the activity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. &#160;THE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCE: An end to the agony of surgery on conscious patients, opening a new era in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;DULL FACT: Molds and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> compete for food, so some molds have evolved to secrete poisons that kill <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. &#160;THE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCE: Penicillin, the conquest of many <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l diseases, and the saving of millions of lives.</p>
<p>&#160;DULL FACT: Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can be used to handle <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and build mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es of molecular size. &#160;THE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCE: <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>-directed <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, bringing cures for virtually all diseases.</p>
<p>&#160;DULL FACT: <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> and personality are embodied in preservable <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> structures. &#160;THE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCE: Present techniques can prevent dissolution, letting the present generation take advantage of tomorrow's <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;In fact, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s aren't even so dull. Since tissues are made of atoms, one should expect a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> able to handle and rearrange atoms to have dramatic medical consequences.</p>
<p>Because this seems too incredible.</p>
<p>We live in a century of the incredible.</p>
<p>&#160;In an article entitled "The Idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a>" in <i>Astronautics and Aeronautics</i>, aerospace <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er Robert T.

<p>&#160;Fundamentally, though, <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> cares nothing for our <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of good and bad and nothing for our <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of balance. In particular, <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> does not hate <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings enough to stack the deck against us. Ancient horrors have vanished before.</p>
<p>&#160;Years ago, surgeons strove to amputate legs <i>fast</i>. Robert Liston of Edinburgh, Scotland, once sawed through a patient's thigh in a record thirty-three seconds, removing three of his assistant's fingers in the process. Surgeons worked fast to shorten their patients' agony, because their patients remained conscious.</p>
<p>&#160;If terminal illness without <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> is a nightmare today, consider surgery without anesthesia in the days of our ancestors: the knife slicing through flesh, the blood flowing, the saw grating on the bone of a conscious patient. . . . Yet in October of 1846, W. T. G. Morton and J. <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Warren removed a tumor from a patient under ether anesthesia; Arthur Slater states that their success "was rightly hailed as the great discovery of the age." With simple techniques based on a known chemical, the waking nightmare of knife and saw at long last was ended.</p>
<p>&#160;With agony ended, surgery increased, and with it surgical infection and the horror of routine <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> from flesh rotting in the body. Yet in 1867 Joseph Lister published the results of his experiments with phenol, establishing the principles of antiseptic surgery. With simple techniques based on a known chemical, the nightmare of rotting alive shrank dramatically.</p>
<p>&#160;Then came sulfa drugs and penicillin, which ended many deadly diseases in a single blow... the list goes on.</p>
<p>&#160;Dramatic medical breakthroughs have come before, sometimes from new uses of known chemicals, as in anesthesia and antiseptic surgery. Though these advances may have seemed too good to be true, they were true nonetheless. Saving lives by using known chemicals and procedures to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> can likewise be true. Because doctors don't use <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> today.</p>
<p>&#160;Robert Ettinger proposed a <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> technique in 1962. He states that Professor Jean Rostand had proposed the same approach years earlier, and had predicted its eventual use in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. Why did <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> by freezing fail to become popular? In part because of its initial expense, in part because of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> inertia, and in part because means for repairing cells remained obscure. Yet the ingrained conservatism of the medical profession has also played a role. Consider again the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of anesthesia.</p>
<p>&#160;In 1846, Morton and Warren amazed the world with the "discovery of the age", ether anesthesia. Yet two years earlier, Horace Wells had used nitrous oxide anesthesia, and two years before that, Crawford W. Long had performed an operation using ether. In 1824, Henry Hickman had successfully anesthetized <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s using ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide; he later spent years urging surgeons in England and France to test nitrous oxide as an anesthetic. In 1799, a full forty-seven years before the great "<i>discovery</i>", and years before Liston's assistant lost his fingers, Sir Humphry Davy wrote: "As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may possibly be used during surgical operations."</p>
<p>&#160;Yet as late as 1839 the conquest of pain still seemed an impossible <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> to many physicians. Dr. Alfred Velpeau stated: "The abolishment of pain in surgery is a chimera. It is absurd to go on seeking it today. 'Knife' and 'pain' are two words in surgery that must forever be associated in the <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of the patient. To this compulsory combination we shall have to adjust ourselves."</p>
<p>&#160;Many feared the pain of surgery more than <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> itself. Perhaps the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> has come to awaken from the final medical nightmare.</p>
<p>Because it hasn't been proved to work.</p>
<p>It is true that no experiment can now demonstrate the resuscitation of a patient in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. But a demand for such a demonstration would carry the hidden assumption that modern <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> has neared the final limits of the possible, that it will never be humbled by the achievements of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Such a demand might sound cautious and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able, but in fact it would smack of overwhelming arrogance.</p>
<p>&#160;Unfortunately, a demonstration is exactly what physicians have been trained to request, and for good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>: they wish to avoid useless procedures that may do harm. Perhaps it will suffice that neglect of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> leads to obvious and irreversible harm.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a>, Cost, &amp; <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">Action</a></h1><p>Whether people choose to use <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> will depend on whether they see it as worth the gamble. This gamble involves the value of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> (which is a personal <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>), the cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> (which seems <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able by the standards of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>), the odds that the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will work (which seem excellent), and the odds that humanity will survive, develop the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and revive people. This final point accounts for most of the overall uncertainty.</p>
<p>&#160;Assume that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings and free societies will indeed survive. (No one can calculate the odds of this, but to assume failure would discourage the very efforts that will promote success.) If so, then <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will continue to advance. Developing <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will take years. Studying cells and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to repair the tissues of patients in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> will take still longer. At a guess, developing repair <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and adapting them to resuscitation will take three to ten decades, though advances in automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering may speed the process.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> required seems unimportant, however. Most resuscitated patients will care more about the conditions of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> - including the presence of their friends and family - than they will care about the date on the calendar. With abundant resources, the physical conditions of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> could be very good indeed. The presence of companions is another <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;In a recently published survey, over half of those responding said that they would like to live for at least five hundred years, if given a free choice. Informal surveys show that most people would prefer <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> to dissolution, if they could regain good health and explore a new <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> with old companions. A few people say that they "want to go when their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> comes," but they generally agree that, so long as they can choose further <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> has not yet come. It seems that many people today share Benjamin Franklin's desire, but in a century able to satisfy it. If <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> catches on fast enough (or if other <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-extension technologies advance fast enough), then a resuscitated patient will awake not to a world of strangers, but to the smiles of familiar faces.</p>
<p>&#160;But will people in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> be resuscitated? Techniques for placing patients in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> are already known, and the costs could become low, at least compared to the costs of major surgery or prolonged hospital care. Resuscitation <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, though, will be complex and expensive to develop. Will people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> bother?</p>
<p>&#160;It seems likely that they will. They may not develop <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> in mind - but if not, then they will surely develop it to build better <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. They may not develop <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with resuscitation in mind, but they will surely do so to heal themselves. They may not <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s for resuscitation as an act of impersonal charity, but they will have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, wealth, and automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and some of them will have loved ones waiting in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>. Resuscitation techniques seem sure to be developed.</p>
<p>&#160;With replicators and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> resources, a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> will come when people have wealth and living <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> over a thousandfold greater than we have today. Resuscitation itself will require little <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and material even by today's standards. Thus, people contemplating resuscitation will find little conflict between their self-interest and their humanitarian concerns. Common <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> motives seem enough to ensure that the active population of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will awaken those in <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;The first generation that will regain youth without being forced to resort to <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> may well be with us today. The prospect of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> simply gives more people more <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to expect long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> - it offers an opportunity for the old and a form of insurance for the young. As advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> lead toward <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> design, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair, and as the implications sink in, the expectation of long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> will spread. By broadening the path to long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> option will encourage a more lively interest in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. And this will spur efforts to prepare for the dangers ahead.</p>
