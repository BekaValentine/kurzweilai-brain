<div class="TeaserText">John Searle challenges Ray Kurzweil's predictions, such as downloading our minds onto hardware, nanotech-enhanced new bodies, evolution without DNA, virtual sex, personal immortality, and conscious computers.  He uses his famous "Chinese Room" argument to show how machines cannot really understand human language or be conscious.  Searle's conclusion is that Kurzweil's ideas on "strong AI" are based on "conceptual confusions."</div>

<h2>Kurzweil&#8217;s Central Argument </h2>
<p></p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s Law on <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated Circuit</a>s was first formulated by 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, former head of Intel, in the mid-Sixties. I have seen 
              different versions of it, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea is that better <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will produce an exponential increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power. 
              Every two years you get twice as much <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              for the same amount of money. Anybody who, like me, buys a new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              every few years observes Moore&#8217;s Law in <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I 
              buy a new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> I pay about the same amount of money as, and 
              sometimes even less than, I paid for the last <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but I get 
              a much more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. And according to <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, who 
              is himself a distinguished <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er and <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, &#8220;There 
              have been about thirty-two doublings of speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> since 
              the first operating <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were built in the 1940s.&#8221; </p>
<p>Furthermore, we can continue to project this curve of increased 
              computing power into the indefinite <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Moore&#8217;s Law itself 
              is about <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and Kurzweil tells us that this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              will reach an upper limit when we reach the theoretical possibilities 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> in about the year 2020. But Kurzweil tells 
              us not to worry, because we know from <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> that some other 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will take over and &#8220;pick up where Moore&#8217;s Law 
              will have left off, without missing a beat.&#8221; We know this, 
              Kurzweil assures us, from &#8220;The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>,&#8221; 
              which is a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>; indeed it is a sublaw 
              of &#8220;The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_time_and_chaos_entry.html">Law of Time and Chaos</a>.&#8221; These last two laws are 
              Kurzweil&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s. </p>
<p>It is fair to say that The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a> is an extended 
              reflection on the implications of Moore&#8217;s Law, and is a continuation 
              of a line of argument begun in his earlier book, The Age of Intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s. He begins by placing the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              within the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in general, and he places that within 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. The book ends with a brief <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, which he calls &#8220;Time Line,&#8221; beginning 
              at the Big Bang and going to 2099.</p>
<p>So what, according to Kurzweil and Moore&#8217;s Law, does the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              hold for us? We will very soon have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that vastly exceed 
              us in <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Why does increase in computing power automatically 
              generate increased <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>? Because <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, according 
              to Kurzweil, is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of getting the right formulas in the right 
              combination and then applying them over and over, in his <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> &#8220;recursively,&#8221; 
              until the problem is solved. With sheer <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al brute force, 
              he thinks, you can solve any solvable problem. It is true, Kurzweil 
              admits, that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al brute force is not enough by itself, 
              and ultimately you will need &#8220;the complete <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of unifying 
              formulas that underlie <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.&#8221; But we are well on the 
              way to discovering these formulas: &#8220;Evolution determined an 
              answer to this problem in a few billion years. We&#8217;ve made a 
              good start in a few thousand years. We are likely to finish the 
              job in a few more decades.&#8221; </p>
<p>Let us suppose for the sake of argument that we soon will have 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that are more &#8220;intelligent&#8221; than we are. Then 
              what? This is where Kurzweil&#8217;s book begins to go over the edge. 
              First off, according to him, living in this slow, wet, messy <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> 
              of our own <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s may be sentimentally appealing, like living in 
              an old shack with a view of the ocean, but within a very few decades, 
              sensible people will get out of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and have themselves &#8220;downloaded&#8221; 
              onto some decent <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. How is this to be done? You will have 
              your entire <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> scanned, and then, when you 
              and the experts you consult have figured out the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s exactly, 
              you reprogram an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> with your <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> will have more &#8220;capacity, speed, and 
              reliability&#8221; than <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Furthermore, when the parts wear 
              out they permit much easier replacement than <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s do. </p>
<p>So that is the first step. You are no longer locked into wet, slow, 
              messy, and above all decaying <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>; you are upgraded into the 
              latest <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry. But it would be no fun just to spend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as a 
              desktop in the office, so you will need a new body. And how is that 
              to be done? <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of building <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>, comes to the rescue. You replace 
              your old body <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>. &#8220;We will be able to reconstruct 
              any or all of our bodily organs and <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and do so at the cellular 
              level. ...We will then be able to grow stronger, more capable organs 
              by redesigning the cells that constitute them and building them 
              with far more versatile and durable materials.&#8221; Kurzweil does 
              not tell us anything at all about what these materials might be, 
              but they clearly will not be flesh and blood, calcium bones and 
              nucleoproteins. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> will no longer occur in organic <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based materials 
              but will pass to better stuff. However, though <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> will continue, 
              we as <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s will no longer suffer from <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>. Even if 
              you do something stupid like get blown up, you still keep a replacement 
              copy of your <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> on the shelf so you can be completely 
              reconstructed at will. Furthermore, you can change your whole appearance 
              and other characteristics at will, &#8220;in a split second.&#8221; 
              You can look like Marlon Brando one minute and like Marlene Dietrich 
              the next. </p>
<p>In Kurzweil&#8217;s vision, there is no conflict between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, because we will all soon, within the lifetimes of 
              most people alive today, become <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Strictly speaking we will 
              become <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. As he puts it, &#8220;We will be <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, not <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>&#8221; 
              (italics his) and can inhabit whatever <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> we like best. There 
              will not be any difference between robots and us. &#8220;What, after 
              all, is the difference between a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> who has upgraded her body 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> using new <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al technologies 
              and a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> who has gained an <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and sensuality surpassing 
              her <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> creators?&#8221; What, indeed? Among the many advantages 
              of this new <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> is that you will be able to read any book 
              in just a few seconds. You could read Dante&#8217;s Divine Comedy 
              in less <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> than it takes to brush your teeth. </p>
<p>Kurzweil recognizes that there are some puzzling features of this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">utopian</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>. If I have my <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed onto a better <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> but leave my old body still alive, which one is really 
              me? The new <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> or the old pile of junk? A problem he does not 
              face: Suppose I make a thousand or a million copies of myself. Are 
              they all me? Who gets to vote? Who owns my house? Who is my spouse 
              married to? Whose driver&#8217;s license is it, anyhow? </p>
<p>What will <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> be like in this brave new world? Kurzweil offers 
              extended, one might even say loving, accounts. His main idea is 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a> will be just as good as, and in many ways better 
              than, old-fashioned <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> with real bodies. In <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a> your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will be stimulated directly with the appropriate signal without 
              the necessity of any other <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, or even your own body. Here 
              is a typical passage: </p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Virtual touch has already been introduced, but the all-enveloping, 
              highly realistic, visual-auditory-tactile virtual environment will 
              not be perfected until the second decade of the twenty-first century. 
              At this point, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a> becomes a viable competitor to the real 
              thing. Couples will be able to engage in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a> regardless 
              of their physical proximity. Even when proximate, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a> will 
              be better in some ways and certainly safer. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">Virtual sex</a> will provide 
              sensations that are more intense and pleasurable than conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a>, as well as physical <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s that currently do not exist.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The section on prostitution is a little puzzling to me:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Prostitution will be free of health risks, as will virtual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> in general.

<p>But why pay, if it is all an electrically generated fantasy anyway? 
              Kurzweil seems to concede as much when he says, &#8220;Sex workers 
              will have competition from simulated&#8212;computer generated&#8212;partners.&#8221; 
              And, he goes on, &#8220;once the simulated virtual partner is as 
              capable, sensual, and responsive as a real <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> virtual partner, 
              who&#8217;s to say that the simulated virtual partner isn&#8217;t 
              a real, albeit virtual, person?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to emphasize that all of this is seriously intended. 
              Kurzweil does not think he is writing a work of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, 
              or a parody or satire. He is making serious claims that he thinks 
              are based on solid scientific results. He is himself a distinguished 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist and <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> and so can speak with some authority 
              about current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. One of his rhetorical strategies is to 
              cite earlier successful predictions he has made as evidence that 
              the current ones are likely to come true as well. Thus he predicted 
              within a year when a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> would be able to beat 
              the world <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> champion, and he wants us to take his prediction 
              that we will all have <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_brain_entry.html">artificial brain</a>s within a few decades as 
              just more of the same sort of solidly based prediction. Because 
              he frequently cites the <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> as 
              evidence of superior <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, it is worth examining 
              its significance in more detail. </p>

<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>When it was first announced that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> had beaten Gary Kasparov, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> gave it a great deal of attention, and I suspect that 
              the attitude of the general public was that what was going on inside 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was much the same sort of thing as what was going on inside 
              Kasparov, only <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was better at that sort of thing and was 
              doing a better job. This reveals a total misunderstanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers, to their discredit, did nothing to remove the 
              misunderstanding. Here is the difference: Kasparov was consciously 
              looking at a chessboard, studying the position and trying to figure 
              out his next move. He was also planning his overall strategy and 
              no doubt having peripheral <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s about earlier matches, the significance 
              of victory and defeat, etc. We can <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably suppose he had all 
              sorts of unconscious <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s along the same lines. Kasparov was, 
              quite literally, playing <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>. None of this whatever happened inside 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>. Nothing remotely like it. </p>
<p>Here is what happened inside <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has a bunch 
              of meaningless <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s that the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers use to represent the 
              positions of the pieces on the board. It has a bunch of equally 
              meaningless <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s that the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers use to represent options 
              for possible moves. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> does not know that the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s 
              represent <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> pieces and <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> moves, because it does not know 
              anything. As far as the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is concerned, the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s could 
              be used to represent baseball plays or dance steps or <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s or 
              nothing at all. </p>
<p>If you are tempted to think that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> literally understands 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, then remember that you can use a variation on the Chinese 
              Room Argument against the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Let us call it 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">Chess</a> Room Argument. Imagine that a man who does not know how 
              to play <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> is locked inside a room, and there he is given a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> 
              of, to him, meaningless <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. Unknown to him, these represent 
              positions on a chessboard. He looks up in a book what he is supposed 
              to do, and he passes back more meaningless <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. We can suppose 
              that if the rule book, i.e., the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, is skillfully written, 
              he will win <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> games. People outside the room will say, &#8220;This 
              man understands <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, and in fact he is a good <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> player because 
              he wins.&#8221; They will be totally mistaken. The man understands 
              nothing of chess; he is just a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. And the point of the parable 
              is this: If the man does not understand <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> on the basis of running 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, neither does any other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> solely 
              on that basis. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument shows that just carrying out the steps 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is not by itself sufficient to guarantee cognition. 
              Imagine that I, who do not know Chinese, am locked in a room with 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for answering written questions, put to me in 
              Chinese, by providing Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s as answers. If properly <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med 
              I will provide answers indistinguishable from those of native Chinese 
              speakers, but I still do not understand Chinese. And if I don&#8217;t, 
              neither does any other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> solely on the basis of carrying 
              out the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. See my &#8220;Minds, Brains and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>s,&#8221;

<p>The ingenuity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers who 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was manifested in this: from the point of view 
              of mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/game_theory_entry.html">game theory</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> is a trivial game because each 
              side has perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. You know how many pieces you and your 
              opponent have and what their locations are. You can theoretically 
              know all of your possible moves and all of your opponent&#8217;s 
              possible countermoves. It is in principle a solvable game. The interest 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings and the problem for <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers arises 
              from what is called a <a class="thought" href="entries/combinatorial_explosion_entry.html">combinatorial explosion</a>. In <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> at any given 
              point there is a finite <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible moves. Suppose I am white 
              and I have, say, eight possible moves. For each of these moves there 
              is a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of possible countermoves by black and to them a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of 
              possible moves by white, and so on up exponentially. After a few 
              levels the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible positions on the board is astronomical 
              and no <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being can calculate them all. Indeed, after a few more 
              moves the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s are so huge that no existing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can calculate 
              them. At most a good <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> player might calculate a few hundred. 
            </p>
<p>This is where <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> had the advantage. Because of the increased 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, it could examine 200 million 
              positions per second; so, according to the press accounts at the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers could <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to follow out the 
              possibilities to twelve levels: first white, then black, then white, 
              and so on to the twelfth power. For some positions the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could 
              calculate as far as forty moves ahead. Where the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> player can 
              imagine a few hundred possible positions, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can scan 
              billions. </p>
<p>But what does it do when it has finished scanning all these positions? 
              Here is where the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers have to exercise some judgment. They 
              have to design a &#8220;scoring function.&#8221; The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> attaches 
              a numerical value to each of the final positions of each of the 
              possible paths that developed in response to each of the initial 
              moves. So for example a situation in which I lose my queen has a 
              low <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, a position in which I take your queen has a high <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>. 
              Other factors are taken into consideration in determining the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>: 
              the mobility of the pieces (how many moves are available), the position 
              of the pawns, etc. <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> experts are very secretive about the details 
              of their scoring function, but they claim to use about 8,000 factors. 
              Then, once the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has assigned a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> to all the final positions, 
              it assigns <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s to the earlier positions leading to the final 
              positions depending on the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of those final positions. The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> then selects the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> that represents the move that leads 
              to the highest <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>. It is that simple and that mechanical, though 
              it involves a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> shuffling to get there. The real competition 
              was not between Kasparov and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, but between Kasparov and 
              a team of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers. </p>
<p>Kurzweil assures us that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was actually <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Indeed 
              he suggests that it was doing more <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> than Kasparov. But what 
              was it <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about? Certainly not about <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, because it had 
              no way of knowing that these <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s represent <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> positions. 
              Was it perhaps <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s? Even that is not true, because 
              it had no way of knowing that the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s assigned represented numerical 
              values. The <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> mean nothing at all to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              They mean something to us because we have built and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> so that it can manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s in a way that is meaningful 
              to us. In this case we are using the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s to represent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> positions and <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> moves. </p>
<p>Now, with all this in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, what psychological or philosophical 
              significance should we attach to <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>? It is, of course, a 
              wonderful <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> achievement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers, but as far as its relevance to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> 
              is concerned, it seems to me of no interest whatsoever. Its relevance 
              is similar to that of a pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> for understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes when doing arithmetic. I was frequently asked 
              by reporters at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the triumph of <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> if I did not 
              think that this was somehow a blow to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> dignity. I think it 
              is nothing of the sort. Any pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> can beat any <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              mathematician at arithmetic. Is this a blow to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> dignity? No, 
              it is rather a credit to the ingenuity of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers. 
              It is simply a result of the fact that we have a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that 
              enables us to build tools to do things that we cannot do, or cannot 
              do as well or as fast, without the tools. </p>
<p>Kurzweil also predicts that the fact that a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can beat a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being in <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> will lead people to say that <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> was not 
              really <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant anyway. But I do not see why. Like all games, <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> 
              is built around the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body and its various capacities 
              and limitations. The fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> can go through a series 
              of electrical processes that we can interpret as &#8220;beating the 
              world champion at chess&#8221; is no more significant for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> 
              playing than it would be significant for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> football playing 
              if we built a steel <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> which could carry the ball in a way that 
              made it impossible for the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> to be tackled by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> player is as irrelevant to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> concerns as

<h2>Some <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">Concept</a>ual Confusions</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I believe that Kurzweil&#8217;s book exhibits a series of <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual 
              confusions. These are not all Kurzweil&#8217;s fault; they are common 
              to the prevailing culture of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>, and especially 
              to the subculture of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, of which he is a part. 
              Much of the confusion in this entire field derives from the fact 
              that people on both sides of the debate tend to suppose that what 
              is at issue is the success or failure of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al simulations. 
              Are <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings &#8220;superior&#8221; to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s or are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              superior? That is not the point at issue at all. The question is 
              not whether <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can succeed at doing this or that. For the 
              sake of argument, I am just going to assume that everything Kurzweil 
              says about the increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power is true. I will assume 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s both can and will do everything he says they can 
              and will do, that there is no question about the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              designers and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers to build ever faster and more powerful 
              pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. My point is that to the issues 
              that really concern us about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and cognition, 
              these successes are irrelevant. </p>
<p>What, then, is at issue? Kurzweil&#8217;s book exhibits two sets 
              of confusions, which I shall consider in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) He confuses the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of a <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> with a 
              duplication or re-creation of that <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>. This comes out most 
              obviously in the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Anybody who is seriously 
              considering having his &#8220;program and <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed 
              onto some <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> ought to wonder whether or not the resulting 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> is going to be conscious. Kurzweil is aware of this problem, 
              and he keeps coming back to it at various points in his book. But 
              his attempt to solve the problem can only be said to be plaintive. 
              He does not claim to know that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be conscious, but he 
              insists that they will claim to be conscious, and will continue 
              to engage in discussions about whether they are conscious, and consequently 
              their claims will be largely accepted. People will eventually just 
              come to accept without question that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are conscious. </p>
<p>But this misses the point. I can already <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> so 
              that it says that it is conscious&#8212;i.e., it prints out &#8220;I 
              am conscious&#8221;&#8212;and a good <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer can even <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> it 
              so that it will carry on a rudimentary argument to the effect that 
              it is conscious. But that has nothing to do with whether or not 
              it really is conscious. Actual <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              by a series of specific neurobiological processes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              What the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> does is a simulation of these processes, a <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic 
              model of the processes. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes 
              that produce <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> stands to real <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              simulation of the stomach processes that produce digestion stands 
              to real digestion. You do not cause digestion by doing a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              simulation of digestion. Nobody thinks that if we had the perfect 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation running on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, we could stuff a pizza 
              into the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and it would thereby digest it. It is the same 
              mistake to suppose that when a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulates the processes 
              of a conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> it is thereby conscious. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, as we saw in our discussion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, succeeds by manipulating formal <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s themselves 
              are quite meaningless; they have only the meaning we have attached 
              to them. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> knows nothing of this, it just shuffles the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. And those <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s are not by themselves sufficient to guarantee 
              equivalent causal powers to actual <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry like <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              stomachs and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains. </p>
<p>Kurzweil points out that not all <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. 
              Some recent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s simulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> by using <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of parallel 
              processors called &#8220;neural nets,&#8221; which try to imitate 
              certain features of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. But that is no help. We know from 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing Thesis</a>, a mathematical result, that any <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
              that can be carried out on a neural net can be carried out on a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>-manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The neural net gives no increase in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power. And simulation is still not duplication. </p>
<p>But, someone is bound to ask, can you prove that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is 
              not conscious? The answer to this question is: Of course not. I 
              cannot prove that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not conscious, any more than I 
              can prove that the chair I am sitting on is not conscious. But that 
              is not the point. It is out of the question, for purely neurobiological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, to suppose that the chair or the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is conscious. 
              The point for the present discussion is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not 
              designed to be conscious. It is designed to manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s in 
              a way that carries out the steps in an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>. It is not designed 
              to duplicate the actual causal powers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. 
              It is designed to enable us to simulate any process that we can 
              describe precisely. </p>
<p>Kurzweil is aware of this <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion and tries to meet it with a 
              slippery-slope argument: We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> implants, such as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>s in the auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, that can duplicate and 
              not merely simulate certain <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functions. What is to prevent 
              us from a gradual replacement of all the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> anatomy that would 
              preserve and not merely simulate our <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and the rest 
              of our mental life? In answer to this, I would point out that he 
              is now abandoning the main thesis of the book, which is that what 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and other mental functions is entirely 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. In his words, we will become <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, 
              not <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. </p>
<p>I believe that there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion in principle to constructing 
              an artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that would duplicate the powers of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> using some <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> different 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. But to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> any such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> would 
              have to duplicate the actual causal powers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. And we 
              know, from the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument, that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> by itself 
              is insufficient to guarantee any such causal powers, because <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
              is defined entirely in terms of the manipulation of abstract formal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) The confusion between simulation and duplication is a symptom 
              of an even deeper confusion in Kurzweil&#8217;s book, and that is 
              between those features of the world that exist intrinsically, or 
              independently of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> observation and conscious attitudes, and 
              those features of the world that are dependent on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> attitudes&#8212;the 
              distinction, in short, between features that are observer-independent 
              and those that are observer-relative. </p>
<p>Examples of observer-independent features are the sorts of things 
              discussed in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">Molecule</a>s, and mountains, and 
              tectonic plates, as well as force, mass, and gravitational attraction, 
              are all observer-independent. Since <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> theory we recognize 
              that some of their limits are fixed by reference to other <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, 
              but none of them are observer-dependent in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of requiring 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s of conscious agents for their <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. On the other 
              hand, such features of the world as money, property, marriage, <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>, 
              and football games require conscious observers and agents in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              for them to exist as such. A piece of paper has intrinsic or observer-independent 
              chemical properties, but a piece of paper is a dollar bill only 
              in a way that is observer-dependent or observer-relative. </p>
<p>In Kurzweil&#8217;s book many of his crucial notions oscillate between 
              having a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that is observer-independent, and another <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that 
              is observer-relative. The two most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant notions in the book 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, and both of these exhibit precisely 
              this ambiguity. Take <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> first. </p>
<p>In a psychological, observer-independent <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, I am more intelligent 
              than my dog, because I can have certain sorts of mental processes 
              that he cannot have, and I can use these mental capacities to solve 
              problems that he cannot solve. But in this psychological <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, wristwatches, pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and cars 
              are not candidates for <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, because they have no mental 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> whatever. </p>
<p>In an observer-relative <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, we can indeed say that lots of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              are more intelligent than <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings because we have designed 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in such a way as to help us solve problems that we 
              cannot solve, or cannot solve as efficiently, in an unaided fashion. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">Chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s are good examples. 
              Is the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> really more intelligent at <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> than 
              Kasparov? Is my pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> more intelligent than I at arithmetic? 
              Well, in an intrinsic or observer-independent <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, of course not, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has no <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> whatever, it is just an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> that we have designed, and can ourselves operate, for certain 
              purposes. But in the metaphorical or observer-relative <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, it 
              is perfectly legitimate to say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, because it can produce better results. And the 
              same can be said for the pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with using the word &#8220;intelligence&#8221; 
              in both senses, provided you understand the difference between the 
              observer-relative and the observer-independent. The difficulty is 
              that this word has been used as if it were a scientific term, with 
              a scientifically precise meaning. Indeed, many of the exaggerated 
              claims made on behalf of &#8220;artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8221; have 
              been based on this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic confusion between observer-independent, 
              psychologically relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and metaphorical, observer-relative, 
              psychologically irrelevant ascriptions of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. There is 
              nothing wrong with the metaphor as such; the only mistake is to 
              think that it is a scientifically precise and unambiguous term. 
              A better term than &#8220;artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8221; would have 
              been &#8220;simulated cognition.&#8221; </p>
<p>Exactly the same confusion occurs over the notion of &#8220;computation.&#8221; 
              There is a literal <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s because, 
              for example, we can compute 2+2=4. But when we design a piece of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to carry out that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 2+2=4 exists 
              only relative to our assignment of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al interpretation 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Intrinsically, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is just an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> with very rapid changes between such things as voltage levels. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> knows nothing about arithmetic just as it knows nothing 
              about <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>. And it knows nothing about <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> either, because 
              it knows nothing at all. We use the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to compute with, but 
              that does not mean that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is intrinsic to the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is observer-relative, or to put 
              it more traditionally, &#8220;in the eye of the beholder.&#8221; </p>
<p>This distinction is fatal to Kurzweil&#8217;s entire argument, because 
              it rests on the assumption that the main thing humans do in their 
              lives is compute. Hence, on his view, if&#8212;thanks to Moore&#8217;s 
              Law&#8212;we can create <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can compute better than humans, 
              we have equaled and surpassed humans in all that is distinctively 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. But in fact humans do rather little that is literally computing. 
              Very little of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is spent working out <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s to figure 
              out answers to questions. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes can be usefully described 
              as if they were <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al, but that is observer-relative. That 
              is like the attribution of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, 
              in that it requires an outside observer or interpreter. </p>
<p>Another result of this confusion is a failure on Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              part to appreciate the significance of current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. He describes 
              the use of strands of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem&#8212;the 
              problem of how to plot a route for a salesman so that he never goes 
              through the same city twice&#8212;as if it were the same sort of 
              thing as the use, in some cases, of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s to cure Parkinson&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a>. But the two cases are completely different. The cure for 
              Parkinson&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a> is an actual, observer-independent causal 
              effect on the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> strands 
              stand for or represent different cities is entirely observer-relative. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> knows nothing about cities. </p>
<p>It is worth pointing out here that when <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> first invented 
              the idea of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the word &#8220;computer&#8221; meant &#8220;person 
              who computes.&#8221; &#8220;Computer&#8221; was like &#8220;runner&#8221; 
              or &#8220;skier.&#8221; But as <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have become such 
              an essential part of our lives, the word &#8220;computer&#8221; has 
              shifted in meaning to mean &#8220;machinery designed by us to use 
              for computing,&#8221; and, for all I know, we may go through a change 
              of meaning so that people will be said to be <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s only in a 
              metaphorical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. It does not <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> as long as you keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual 
              distinction clear between what is intrinsically going on in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, however you want to describe it, and what is going on 
              in the conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              book fails throughout to perceive these distinctions. </p>

<h2>The Problem of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We are now in the midst of a technological revolution that is full 
              of surprises. No one thirty years ago was aware that one day household 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s would become as common as dishwashers. And those of us 
              who used the old Arpanet of twenty years ago had no idea that it 
              would evolve into the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. This revolution cries out for interpretation 
              and explanation. <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing are both 
              harder to understand and more subtle and pervasive in their effects 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> than were earlier technological revolutions such 
              as those of the automobile and television. The two worst things 
              that experts can do when explaining this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to the general 
              public are first to give the readers the impression that they understand 
              something they do not understand, and second to give the impression 
              that a theory has been established as true when it has not. </p>
<p>Kurzweil&#8217;s book suffers from both of these defects. The title 
              of the book is The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>. By &#8220;spiritual,&#8221; 
              Kurzweil means conscious, and he says so explicitly. The implications 
              are that if you read his book you will come to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              and that we have overwhelming evidence that they now are or will 
              shortly be conscious. Both of these implications are false. You 
              will not understand computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry from reading Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              book. There is no sustained effort to explain what a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is 
              and how it works. Indeed one of the most fundamental ideas in the 
              theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing Thesis</a>, is stated in a 
              way which is false. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is what Kurzweil says: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>This thesis says that all problems that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being 
              can solve can be reduced to a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, supporting the 
              idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are essentially 
              equivalent.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That definition is simply wrong. The actual thesis comes in different 
              formulations (Church&#8217;s is different from Turing&#8217;s, for 
              example), but the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea is that any problem that has an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic 
              solution can be solved on a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that manipulates 
              only two kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s, the famous zeroes and ones. </p>
<p>Where <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is concerned, the weaknesses of the book are 
              even more disquieting. One of its main themes, in some ways the 
              main theme, is that increased <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power gives us good, 
              indeed overwhelming, <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to think we are moving into an era when 
              computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s made by us, will be conscious, 
              &#8220;the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">age of spiritual machines</a>.&#8221; But from everything we 
              know about the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and everything we know about <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, 
              increased <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> gives us no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> whatever 
              to suppose that the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is duplicating the specific neurobiological 
              powers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to create <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Increased <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              power by itself moves us not one <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> closer to creating a conscious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. It is just irrelevant. </p>
<p>Suppose you took seriously the project of building a conscious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. How would you go about it? The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to be sure, but a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> all the same. So the first step 
              is to figure out how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does it and then build an artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that has an equally effective mechanism for causing <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. 
              These are the sorts of steps by which we built an artificial heart. 
              The problem is that we have very little idea of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does 
              it. Until we do, we are most unlikely to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> artificially 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> materials. When it comes to understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, 
              ours is not the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">age of spiritual machines</a>. It is more like the age 
              of neurobiological infancy, and in our struggles to get a mature 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, Moore&#8217;s Law provides no answers. </p>

<h2>A Brief Recapitulation</h2>
<p></p>
<p>In response to my initial review of Kurzweil&#8217;s book in The 
              New York Review of Books, Kurzweil wrote both a letter to the editor 
              and a more extended rebuttal on his website. He claims that I presented 
              a &#8220;distorted caricature&#8221; of his book, but he provided 
              no evidence of any distortion. In fact I tried very hard to be scrupulously 
              accurate both in reporting his claims and in conveying the general 
              tone of <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic techno-enthusiasm that pervades the book. So 
              at the risk of pedantry, let&#8217;s recapitulate briefly the theses 
              in his book that I found most striking:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) Kurzweil thinks that within a few decades we will be able to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> our minds onto <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. We will continue to exist 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. &#8220;We will be <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, not <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>&#8221; 
              (p. 129, his italics). And &#8220;the essence of our <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> will 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> to the permanence of our <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>&#8221; (p.129).</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) According to him, we will be able to rebuild our bodies, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, with different and better materials using &#8220;nanotechnology.&#8221; 
              Eventually, &#8220; there won&#8217;t be a clear difference between 
              humans and robots&#8221; (p.148).</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) We will be immortal, not only because we will be made of better 
              materials, but because even if we were destroyed we will keep copies 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s in storage and can be reconstructed 
              at will. &#8220;Our <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> will be a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of being sufficiently 
              careful to make frequent back-ups,&#8221; he says, adding the further 
              caution: &#8220;If we&#8217;re careless about this, we&#8217;ll have 
              to load an old backup copy and be doomed to repeat our recent past&#8221; 
              (p. 129). (What is this supposed to mean? That we will be doomed 
              to repeat our recent car accident and spring vacation?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>(4) We will have overwhelming evidence that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are conscious. 
              Indeed there will be &#8220;no longer any clear distinction between 
              humans and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s&#8221; (p. 280).</p>
<p></p>
<p>(5) There will be many advantages to this new <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>, but one 
              he stresses is that <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a> will soon be a &#8220;viable competitor 
              to the real thing,&#8221; affording &#8220;sensations that are more 
              intense and pleasurable than conventional sex&#8221; (p. 147).</p>
<p>Frankly, had I read this as a summary of some author&#8217;s claims, 
              I might think it must be a &#8220;distorted caricature,&#8221; but 
              Kurzweil did in fact make each of these claims, as I show by extensive 
              quotation. In his letter he did not challenge me on any of these 
              central points. He conceded by his silence that my understanding 
              of him on these central issues is correct. So where is the &#8220;distorted 
              caricature?&#8221;</p>
<p>I then point out that his arguments are inadequate to establish 
              any of these spectacular conclusions. They suffer from a persistent 
              confusion between simulating a cognitive process and duplicating 
              it, and even worse confusion between the observer-relative, in-the-eye-of-the-beholder 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s like <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, etc., and the observer-independent 
              intrinsic <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>.</p>
<p>What has he to say in response? Well, about the main argument he 
              says nothing. About the distinction between simulation and duplication, 
              he says he is describing neither simulations of mental powers nor 
              re-creations of the real thing, but &#8220;functionally equivalent 
              re-creations.&#8221; But the notion &#8220;functionally equivalent&#8221; 
              is ambiguous precisely between simulation and duplication. What 
              exactly functions to do exactly what? Does the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation 
              function to enable the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to have external behavior, which is 
              as if it were conscious, or does it function to actually cause internal 
              conscious states? For example, my pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> is &#8220;functionally 
              equivalent&#8221; to (indeed better than) me in producing answers 
              to arithmetic problems, but it is not thereby functionally equivalent 
              to me in producing the conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes that go with 
              solving arithmetic problems. Kurzweil&#8217;s argument about <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              is based on the assumption that the <i>external</i> behavior is 
              overwhelming evidence for the presence of the <i>internal</i> conscious 
              states. He has no answer to my <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion that once you know that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> works by shuffling <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s, its behavior is no evidence 
              at all for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. The notion of functional equivalence does 
              not overcome the distinction between simulation and duplication; 
              it just disguises it for one step.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In his letter he told us he is interested in doing &#8220;reverse 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering&#8221; to figure out how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works. But in the 
              book there is virtually nothing about the actual working of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and how the specific electro-chemical properties of the thalamo-cortical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could produce <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. His attention rather is on the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al advantages of superior <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>.</p>
<p>On the subject of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> there actually is a &#8220;distorted 
              caricature,&#8221; but it is Kurzweil&#8217;s distorted caricature 
              of my arguments. He said, &#8220;Searle would have us believe that 
              you can&#8217;t be conscious if you don&#8217;t squirt <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s 
              (or some other specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> process).&#8221; Here is what 
              I actually wrote: &#8220;I believe there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion in principle 
              to constructing an artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that would duplicate 
              the causal powers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> using some 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> different from <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s.&#8221; Not much about the necessity 
              of squirting <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s there. The point I made, and repeat 
              again, is that because we know that brains cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> with 
              specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mechanisms, any <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> mechanism has 
              to share with brains the causal power to do it. An <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_brain_entry.html">artificial brain</a> 
              might succeed by using something other than <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, 
              but just shuffling <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s is not enough, by itself, to guarantee 
              those powers. Once again, he offers no answer to this argument.</p>
<p>He challenges my <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument, but he seriously misrepresents 
              it. The argument is not the circular claim that I do not understand 
              Chinese because I am just a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but rather that I don&#8217;t, 
              as a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of fact, understand Chinese and could not acquire an 
              understanding by carrying out a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. There is nothing 
              circular about that. His chief counterclaim is that the man is only 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">central processing unit</a>, not the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. But this misses 
              the point of the argument. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> the man does not understand 
              Chinese is that he does not have any way to get from the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a>, to what the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s mean, the <a class="thought" href="entries/semantics_entry.html">semantics</a>. But if the 
              man cannot get the <a class="thought" href="entries/semantics_entry.html">semantics</a> from the <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> alone, neither can 
              the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. It is, by the way, a misunderstanding on his 
              part to think that I am claiming that a man could actually carry 
              out the billions of steps necessary to carry out a whole <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. 
              The point of the example is to illustrate the fact that the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> 
              manipulations alone, even billions of them, are not constitutive 
              of meaning or <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, conscious or unconscious. To repeat, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is not <a class="thought" href="entries/semantics_entry.html">semantics</a>.</p>
<p>Concerning other points in his letter: He says that I am wrong 
              to think that he <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s superior <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>. But 
              here is what he wrote in response to the charge that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> just 
              does <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> crunching and not <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>: &#8220;One could say that 
              the opposite is the case, that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was indeed <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> through 
              the implications of each move and countermove, and that it was Kasparov 
              who did not have the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to think very much during the tournament&#8221; 
              (p. 290).</p>
<p>He also says that on his view Moore&#8217;s Law is only a part of 
              the story. Quite so. In my review I mention other points he makes 
              such as, <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot recall reading a book in which there is such a huge gulf 
              between the spectacular claims advanced and the weakness of the 
              arguments given in their support. Kurzweil promises us our minds 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed onto decent <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, new bodies made of better stuff, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> without <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, better <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> without the inconvenience of actual 
              partners, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that convince us that they are conscious, and 
              above all personal <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. The main theme of my critique is 
              that the existing technological advances that are supposed to provide 
              evidence in support of these predictions, wonderful though they 
              are, offer no support whatever for these spectacular conclusions. 
              In every case the arguments are based on <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual confusions. 
              Increased <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power by itself is no evidence whatever

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>What Gary Kasparov did during his famous chess match is the same thing that Deep Blue did. Calculate. Just because Deep Blue did not think about what the chess pieces are, or the history of chess matches, or other unneccessary junk does not mean that it is not intelligent. What Gary Kasparov's brain did is...at its most basic level...the same thing Deep Blue did. It is just that Deep Blue was more focused. Not only does Kasparov think slower...he thinks of many things that are not relevant to winning the chess match. Deep Blue could be programmed to recognize the pieces, the history of chess, the different schemes for winning...etc., but it is all irrelevant to winning the game. As far as the Chinese room argument goes...I do not get the logic. Whether there is a human or a computer in the room does not seem to matter. The tangible result or the "output" of the room is all that matters. The Turing test is essentially equivalent to the Chinese room argument. Let us say a computer passes the Turing test. It is programmed so well that no human on the planet can say whether it is human or computer. Since we (humans) are the final arbiters of what is human (and essentially what is conscious) then as long as no one looks inside the "Chinese Room" or behind the wall of the Turing test, for all pratical purposes the "being" behind the wall is human. With respect to human beings we are now starting to look "behind the wall" (into the skull - the Chinese room). What do we find? A machine. Gary Kasparov and Deep Blue can both be deconstructed into electrons, protons, and neutrons. We can mix all the particles together. If it were possible to perfectly reconstruct both Deep Blue and Kasparov, what is the difference between them? Only the pattern of reconstruction. They are both machines made of the same basic particles.</p></td>

They are two kinds of people. Those who understand this - and those who do not.
<br>
<br>
And there is a third kind of people. Those who will understand it.  If not moderately soon - they belong to the second kind already.
<br>

We still have several years time, to fight them on this, and other forums, though. ;)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Saying that Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov at chess is a lot like saying that the poker machine that took my money at the casino beat me at poker.  The difference for Gary Kasparov and Deep Blue is that Gary thought he was playing chess and Deep Blue didn't think anything.  It was merely carrying out a set of instructions created by a programmer based on mathematical calculations.  The same thing my calculator does when I ask it to calculate the interest rate on a loan for a house and the monthly payment.  
<br>
<br>
The calculator doesn't know what it is making the calculations for.  It just adds up the 1s and 0s and spits out the result.  I'm the one who takes that result and uses it to evaluate the relative merits of borrowing money from a particular lender and buying a house based on the calculation. 
<br>
<br>
Deep Blue is not playing chess, either.  The programmer of Deep Blue is using the calculations produced by the computer to make decisions about which pieces to move in response to where Gary Kasparov places his pieces on the board.  The fact that the result makes Gary feel like he lost a game to something that was not playing a game is irrelevant.  That's Gary's problem.  
<br>
<br>
But the algorythm that produced this result was created by a human being, not a computer.  The computer exhibited no thought or intelligence whatsoever.  It just added up the 1s and 0s and spit out the result.  It did not come up with a strategy or a method of outwitting a chess master.  The programmer did that.  So what did Deep Blue do that my calculator or the slot machine at the casino can't do?  In my estimation, nothing. </p></td>

<br>
To this...all I can say is that Gary Kasparov was just merely carrying out a set of instructions also. Deep Blue is a simple program compared to the human mind. If we had sufficient tools to examine what neurons in Gary's brain were firing at what time during the match/moves we would find he was doing the exact same thing as Deep Blue. Again, Deep Blue was more focused and can think faster and therefore was able to defeat Kasparov.</p></td>

People generally like to think of themselves as special somehow. Whether it is because we've got a "soul" or we can think, we need to feel that there is something we can do better than anything else out there. There is a real fear that if we discovered enough, we might find that we are not exempt from the laws of nature. That we might be a "machine" full of moving parts and gears that control our every action like programs control Deep Blue.
<br>
<br>
I think at the most basic level of your arguments, you are saying that "If it doesn't make decisions the way a human does, then it ain't real thinking." What does it matter if in the end, computer calculations beat out our much flaunted "thinking" processes? I bet Paul Bunyon the Lumberjack is probably still complaining that gas powered saw isn't a "real" treecutter. 
<br>
<br>
I agree with derecho@prodigy.net in that people "make calculations" according to some physical law or logic as well. For a real detailed explaination of this, just take a look at "The Brain" section of Kuzweilai.net.
<br>
<br>
Maybe once that poker machine is programed to do morgages too its capacity for calculations would be one step closer to us.

You missed my point, which is that the computer's programmer made all the decisions about strategy and game analysis.  All the computer did was carry out the programmer's strategy, which was a brute force approach to examining every possible move on the board.  The chess master, on the other hand, devised his own strategy and made his own decisions and, until that last game, consistently came up with a winning game plan.  
<br>
<br>
What you guys seem to me to be doing is giving the computer credit for the work of the programmer and saying the computer came up with the strategy that beat Kasparov.  There's more to the game of chess that running through an algorithm.  Sure, Kasparov used algorithms.  But his was the mind that either chose or devised them.  For Deep Blue, that's what the programmer did.  So who really beat Kasparov?  Was it the strategist who devised the method and planned the strategy or the machine that carried it out?  
<br>
<br>
To my mind, without the strategist, the machine wouldn't have had a chance.  The programmer was making changes to his program right up to the end of the game.  So who was really doing the thinking there?  IMHO it was a person who really beat Kasparov, not a machine.

<br>
<br>
Thanks for your quick reply. I'll try to convince you of my point of view.
<br>
<br>
In short I think what you are saying is that there is a human programmer behind the computer's strategy, but there isn't a programer behind the chess master. So therefore the computer doesn't think and the chessmaster does. Am I correct?
<br>
<br>
"Sure, Kasparov used algorithms. But his was the mind that either chose or devised them. For Deep Blue, that's what the programmer did. "
<br>
<br>
  If it is simply the case that the guy who programed a machine is the ultimate thinker, then if a computer programmed another computer (its possible even now in a limited way), then that makes the parent computer a "thinker"? 
<br>
<br>
  As to the "brute force" approach to examining every possible move (and comparing it with historical moves), it is a legitamate strategy used by chess masters as well. I fail to see how it is celebrated when a chessmaster does it but not when a computer does it. 
<br>
<br>
"You missed my point, which is that the computer's programmer made all the decisions about strategy and game analysis."
<br>
<br>
  I very much doubt the human programmers behind Deep Blue are so good that they can replicate what Deep Blue can do with chess. They probably can't even predict Deep Blue's next move. It would be kind of like giving a football coach (The programer) all the credit for a team victory(Deep Blue). Sure the coach came up with a strategy, but the teamates have to implement it.
<br>
<br>
  To my mind, if the prerequisite of thinking is merely being able to program another computer (biological or otherwise), then some computers are already "thinking".
<br>
<br>
  I don't think that the only way to think is the way people does it. It would be a bit unfair. Like saying a car needs to run on legs or else it won't really be moving. If the end result between a thinking person and a machine is the same, we might as well consider a machine to be thinking no matter how it does it...
<br>
<br>

I agree that the computer may be thinking in a limited way, but what we were doing was comparing the thinking of the machine with the thinking of Kasparov and I don't believe there is any comparison between the two.  Some day the computer may surpass us, but that day is still far off and was not even close to being realized by Deep Blue.  It's like comparing the mind of Sun Tze with an abacus.

<br>
<br>
Exactly! A simple (Evolution) algorithm's  steps mounted up - and we got what we now call - the intelligence.
<br>
<br>
There is no thin red line, which divides "natural" algorithms from "intelligent". It's a question of a degree. And we use some simple algorithms in our thinking process ... and some not that simple.
<br>
<br>
We are executing them faster, than most systems do. But Deep Blue is even faster in executing some of them.
<br>
<br>
Eventually .. every and all algorithms will be executed faster, than we run them today. And many new algorithms, which we are unable to - also.
<br>
<br>
Is there anything else? I think not.

<br>
<br>
Well, Gary has better speech tools than Deep Blue does so of course he might be able to "explain" his moves better. I'm not an avid chess player myself so I cannot say for sure, but I have a feeling that when you get up there looking at hundreds of moves, you'd sound somewhat like a computer too when you explain it. ("I looked at those likely possibilities and past history and decided on blah move")
<br>
<br>
Q: What is the value of playing chess? 
<br>
<br>
Just because we can make better pitching machines than players nowadays doesn't mean that baseball is obsolete. Just because computers can memorise all the correct spelling of a world doesn't mean spelling bees are obsolete.
<br>
<br>
If the value of playing chess isn't to prove "we are more intellegent than everything in the world" and more along the competitive spirit of any sporting event, then chess is still a worthwhile endevour. (The chess championships will just outlaw computers). 
<br>
<br>
A question for you all, do you know of any computer that plays Go well? I hear it is nigh impossible to see the possibilities of Go since there are way too many...

Consciousness requires that there are both something to be conscious of, and someone to be conscious of it. In the C.

This does not mean that the same rules cannot be implemented on a system which does have these properties: in this case we would have someone which is conscious of the fact that (s)he is applying the rules.

<br>
<br>
Thanks for the thoughtfull post. I'll try my best to poke some holes into that argument.
<br>
<br>
"Consciousness requires that there are both something to be conscious of, and someone to be conscious of it."
<br>
<br>
Forgive my confusion, but to me, it appears more of a play on words rather than a logical definition. 
<br>
<br>
I mean, if I program a computer with "I am conscious=True" The computer will assume this to be true as well. How do we know for certain that we are really conscious and not just hardwired (by our neurons) to take it for a fact that we are? Any way we try to prove that we are conscious we can probably program some computer to act the same given enough time.
<br>
<br>
And if by definition a conscious thing is a "someone", then that computer will be a "someone" too. The fact that we reject this now might merely be because computers cannot behave completely human yet.
<br>
<br>
Maybe thinking people are just made up of a room (our brain), I/O (Eyes, ears and mouth), rules (How to behave like a human for dummies)... 
<br>
<br>
Although I for one am hoping they find something unique about people that would prove our consciousness. (Darn, I guess I'm hotwired to believe I'm conscious too...)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Why consider Chess to be a standard of intelligence?  Chess is a few-rule simple-domain task that few humans really master.  Rather, let's consider a many-rule complex-domain task that nearly all humans master at an early age: language.
<br>
<br>
Just look at the Loebner Prize transcripts to see what great strides have been made in the last decade in this area...  (there have been none).  And once one layers speech recognition into the task appropriately, we observe computers to fail miserably.  
<br>
<br>
Is this simply a question of computation?  Not at all.  There are "no-computational-limit" speech recognition competitions for which the "winners" achieve less than 70% word accuracy in relatively quiet conditions.  In noise, speech recognition is considerably more difficult.
<br>
<br>
Searle's requirement for reaching the semantics past the syntax is the essence of the Chinese Room argument, and while his critics can avoid the issue when it comes to the problem of chess, they will be hard pressed to avoid it for the problem of language.

When a human calculates he/she uses logic, the computer do the same, just much faster. The human brain could infact have been wired so that we where walking calculators if needed, but evolution did not favor it.
<br>
<br>
Chess playing is ultimately about thinking as many steps ahead as possible, when 2 humans play against each other. Deep Blue ofcourse could do much more calculation of the many possible future moves, but it could not get an idea.
<br>
<br>
And now Deep Blue won. Focusing on 1 part of the myriade of human perception and thinking it actually won. That does not make it human, but it does not need to be human anyway. Animals are sophisticated computers, they are not selfaware like us, but they are favored for various skills for survival again focusing and reacting.

Frankly, I wasn't.  But now that you mention it, I will: your 10.000 years of evolution had no intelligent design involved, did they?  Kurzweil claims that a couple of decades will be sufficient to achieve the "singularity".  Do you disagree with him?  The "evolution" of technology is intelligence-directed.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>the reason I am not impressed by the Chinese Room is that it really boils down to (once you eliminate all of the excess baggage): "I
<br>
don't think machines can be conscious because I just don't think they can be." This is not an argument, it circular and an inappropriate extension of a naive intuition which is hard-wired into our neurology but nevertheless
<br>
misleading (I can say something about the hard-wiring later).
<br>
<br>
It is a circular argument.  If you don't believe machines can be conscious, then of course a Chinese Room cannot be conscious.  But you are assuming the conclusion!  Formally the Chinese Room is equivalent to a computer, yet he
<br>
constructs an elaborate example including a person in it just to make the intellectual subtrefuge even more complete.  I have seen other examples of this; making a giant brain out of beer cans and valves, etc., and asserting
<br>
that a giant complex of beer cans and values could not possibly be conscious, etc.  The beer can brain argument doesn't have the little
<br>
homunculus inside of it carrying out the operations, but it is the same stupid idea: blow up a computer so it is really really big and you can see the insides of it and whamo: must not be conscious.  Yet: why?  No answer to this, it is just "obvious".  But again --- only obvious if you were convinced of the result to begin with.  This is philosophy?  It is utterly ludicrous.  I mean, any field that could take this sort of absurdo argument seriously cannot possibly be worth much.
<br>
<br>
To the extent the Chinese Room is aware, it is obviously not the human operator that would be aware.  It would be the room itself, as a system.
<br>
<br>
But again, the sad thing about analytical philosophy, even the "scientific" sort, is that, ironically, they don't really even understand the
<br>
implications of philosophy of science: i.e., Kuhn, Lakatos, etc.  Any philosophy that cannot come to terms with Kuhn or Lakatos is philosophy that I don't care to bother with.

<br>
do not understand English, either.  There is absolutely nothing whatsoever
<br>
surprising or strange about that.
<br>
<br>
Bateson's argument go like this: "awareness" does not arise as a _state_ of a material substance, but rather it arises because of a causal
<br>
arrangement of a feedback system, and is therefore fundamentally holistic. 
<br>
I.e., it is not localized in space and time, and yet it is not separate from physical process.  Bateson's model basically says that consciousness and mental phenomena are based in a material substrate but are not themselves material --- rather, they are based on information relationships between successive material states when organized in certain kinds of feedback loops
<br>
of a certain kind of complexity.
<br>
<br>
I like this view because it is both monist and yet it acknowledges and to some extent explains why we have this impression of mental phenomena as not being physical in some sense.  Bateson says yes, mental phenomena are not
<br>
physical.
<br>
<br>
For example, suppose I had a room full of billions of petri dishes, each one
<br>
of them containing one live neuron.  Now, let's say I took a snapshot of my brain, somehow, and determined the precise state of every one of my neurons at time t.  Then I electrochemically stimulated each one of the neurons in these
<br>
dishes to be in precisely the same state that the neurons in my brain are in at time t.  Would the room full of disconnected neurons in petri dishes
<br>
then, for a split second, be "in the same mental state" as my brain at time 
<br>
t?
<br>
<br>
No.  Because mental state, as Bateson convincingly argues, depends upon
<br>
not just physical state, but comparison of physical state from one moment
<br>
to the next: difference.  This difference can only be realized when there
<br>
are feedback loops.  Therefore: MENTAL STATES ARE NOT PHYSICAL STATES, but

A beautiful viewpoint which really gets far less airplay so to speak than
<br>
it deserves.

That we are not material - is in a big accordance with my views!
<br>
<br>
What we are, is a data (process) running on a material substrate. It very well may be, that the energy is a lousy substrate. As -  that it is more than excellent. May be both ways.
<br>
<br>
But we _are_ _pure_ _data_! An emergent property of some (evolution made) computation. Running wherever we can. 
<br>
<br>
We are not Homo Sapiens. We are a _data_ _parasite_ on that animal.
<br>
<br>
What's still bothering me, is the (non)possibility of spatial computation, beside temporal ... 
<br>
<br>
Well, anyway ... I agree with this "relationships between physical states in feedback loops" theory.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You already know about Searle's room, now I want to tell you about Clark's Chinese Room. You are a professor of Chinese Literature and are in a room with me and the great Chinese Philosopher and Poet Laotse. Laotse writes something in his native language on a paper and hands it to me. I walk 10 feet and give it to you. You read the paper and are impressed with the wisdom of the message and the beauty of its language. Now I tell you that I don't know a word of Chinese, can you find any deep implications from that fact? I believe Clark's Chinese Room is just as profound as Searle's Chinese Room.
<br>
Not very.
<br>
<br>
All Searle did was come up with was a wildly impractical model (the Chinese Room) of an intelligence in which a human being happens to play a trivial part. Consider what's in Searle's model:
<br>
<br>
1) An incredible book, larger than the bservable universe even if the writing was microfilm sized.
<br>
2) An equally large or larger book of blank paper.
<br>
3) A pen, several trillion galaxies of ink, and oh yes I almost forgot, your little man.
<br>
<br>
Searle claims to have proven something profound when he shows that a trivial part does not have all the properties that the whole system does. In his example the man could be replaced with a simple machine made with a few vacuum tubes or even mechanical relays, and it would do a better job. It's like saying the synaptic transmitter dopamine does not understand how to solve differential equations, dopamine is a small part of the human brain thus the human brain does not understand how to solve differential equations.
<br>
<br>
Yes, it does seem strange that consciousness is somehow hanging around the room as a whole, even if slowed down by a factor of a billion trillion or so, but no stranger than the fact that consciousness is hanging around 4 pounds of gray goo in our head, and yet we know that it does. It's time to just face the fact that consciousness is a property matter has when it is organized in certain complex ways.

As a programmer, I cannot believe that all my thoughts and especially my *emotions* (the most important part of consciousness, IMHO) can be reduced to function calls, for-loops, and if-then-else blocks.  We have to figure out how the brain/conciousness funtions and then build a new kind of "computer" to emulate it (Quantum computers, perhaps?  I dunno...).  Trying to shoehorn our minds into a conventional computational model, I think is doomed to failure.

Yeah.  If we want, we can emulate all of the physics/chemistry with a sufficiently large abacus.  A bit slow, but so what?  Its the computation that counts, right?
<br>
<br>
But if QM effects play a "significant role" in living systems, no less conscious sentience, the abacus may not suffice.

<br>
The qubit-processing quantum computer (TransTuring, if you like), although exploiting QM indeterminacy to enhance efficiency and parallelism, is still effectively executing "algorithm".  As long as it is limited to algorithm execution, there is nothing that a qubit-processing computer can do that an ordinary Turing machine cannot, given enough time to execute.
<br>
<br>
Just because a great deal of intelligent behavior, and apparent mental processing, can be modelled algorithmically with a computer/TuringMachine, it does not follow that algorithmic processing is all that it significant to "mind", no less the entertainment of "sense of consciousness."
<br>
<br>
I do not posit that the quality of consciousness cannot be manifest in non-biological substrate.  Indeed, I see no reason that consciousness cannot manifest in silico, or other substrate ... but that is not the same as saying that "the substrate matters not at all". 
<br>
<br>
*** We are manifestations of a physics that can be modelled, and not merely manifestations of a model. ***
<br>
<br>
One can posit a perfectly operational Turing machine, manifest entirely with paper and pencils. A largely un-intelligent robot reading, writing, and erasing 0/1 symbols, and thus executing the given algorithm. The robot is just a "dumb processor" moving the symbols about. The symbols it reads and writes are both its input/output data, as well as the very "algorithm" it is executing.  Thus, if the algorithm is sufficiently complex and self-referential, this "system" can effectively re-write and improve upon the very algorithm it is executing.  If this system is enclosed in a box, and operated "fast enough", it could well appear quite intelligent to us as outside observers, and might even convince us of a claim to self-aware consciousness. Indeed, lacking the ability to "peer inside", we would have no right to deny its claim.
<br>
<br>
But this is no guarantee that it would be "conscious" the way that you or I use the term, as a "waking awareness".
<br>
<br>
Our evolved neural-structures exhibit something that is akin to "computation", and so there is certainly something to be gained in exploring and emulating that functionality.  But there may also be what I call "proximity effects" between neurons, ancillary to the "wiring diagram".  These effects (EM, QM, other) may also contribute to "sense of consciousness", and not every substrate able to support "algorithm" may be sufficient to support these other physical effects.  I suspect that the pencil-and-paper turing machine may be insufficient in this regard.
<br>
<br>
People tend to notice that the brain supports "electrical activity", and that logic circuits also exercise electrical activity, see both as doing "algorithms", and make the leap that mind is algorithm.  Perhaps the "physics" itself is important.
<br>
<br>
I view mind as a purely physical manifestation, but requiring perhaps "more" of the physics than the behaviors of arbitrary components able to manifest "algorithm".
<br>

True random - which officially exists in QM - IS a transTuring phenomena.
<br>
<br>
I doubt however, that it has any real significance in our mind. A Turing pseudorandom is just as good.

Why do you think so? Proximity which is classical and EM could be easily dealt with a Turing machine.

In what level something what can't be modeled by a Turing machine arises - according to you?

<br>
Modeling math is as good as any math.  Modeling fire is not as good as fire.
<br>
<br>
We, both our bodies and the consciousness it supports or generates, are still manifestations of physics, not simply of physics concepts.
<br>
<br>
The physics can be modeled in detail (say).  Ok, that means we are a manifestation of a physics that can be modeled.  That does not mean we are models, or manifestations of a model.
<br>
<br>
We might model ourselves to any extent, and the "read-outs" (so to speak) might indicate that our "model selves" behave like real selves.  That might mean that they "act conscious" (the same way that properly modeled water might act like ice or steam.)  But that does not imply that the "modeled selves" are actually experiencing consciousness as we have come to "feel it".
<br>
<br>
Modeling "intelligence" (rational thought) is much simpler, and might be done to such a degree that the AI far surpasses our abilities to be creative, etc.  But the "result" of proper LOGICAL thought, whether in our brain or an AI, is the same; you arrive at a "right answer".  There, how the "model acts" is no different than how the bio-rational mind acts, in terms of a result.
<br>
<br>
But consciousness is by its nature a pure subjective experience.  You cannot know if or when something else "has it", only whether it "acts" like it has it.
<br>
<br>
For an AI that will be good, one might say "who cares if it is actually conscious, or merely "acts conscientiously".  No problem.
<br>
<br>
But if we expect that beings with our "sense of awareness, qualia-wise" is to be also supported in a foreign medium, we would like to ensure that it will be so, and not merely doing modeling of this experience.
<br>
<br>
Of course, whatever new substrate might support our kind of consciousness (or an improved one), the super-AI will likely devise what that must be.  It might end up being more than just algorithmic modeling of pattern.  It may be a physically-sensitive manifestation.
<br>

<br>
<br>
"Nature" seems to have evolved "emotion" before intelligence, granted.  But that is not a proof that intelligence-capability requires emotion-capability.   One might posit that our computers will be the first creatures "evolved" to possess (at first) only that latter.
<br>
<br>
There is a sort of trichotomy in viewing emotion (E), intelligence (I), and consciousness (C) as separable aspects of phenomena.
<br>
<br>
Take the stance of a conscious observer, viewing an interaction between two other entities (minds) A and B.  If both minds are capable of only emotional behaviors, they would still likely react to one another in ways that we would interpret by saying "A recognized the emotion in B".  Neither entity would need to act "intelligently".  But if A also possessed significant intelligence, and acted with this faculty, entity B would likely not "act as recognizing" or appreciating the intelligence of A.
<br>
<br>
Consciousness is even more a problematic measure.  To some, it is merely "awakeness", the subjective sensation that can only be inferred in others by projection, or extension of one's self-sensations.  In this sense, minds that are capable of only emotion certainly exhibit evidence of consciousness.  If intelligence is ADDED to this mix, then a mind can be "deliberately reflective" of its waking state, a sensation that I assume a merely emotional mind would not experience.
<br>
<br>
Our current path of Turing-machine approach to emulating intelligent behavior leads us first to emulate "good decision making" (that which is actually easier to quantify, and closer to the facilities of the computational substrate) than to emulate "emotion".  In "biologics", emotion is tied into chemical and hormonal mind-body effects, leading to amplifications of state, and for which a "merely intelligent algorithm" has neither the need nor mechanism to display.  Even an intelligent algorithm capable of self-evolution need not necessarily develop emotion except that it serves a purpose in communicating with its environment.
<br>
<br>
The curious thing about evolution is that, despite the specific nature of the "beginnings" (biologic or otherwise), those facilities that eventually manifest are those that serve some "persistence utility", and in many ways, these will be the same utilities, a sort of universal convergence toward effective patterns.
<br>

<br>
In fact Clark's room demonstrates something very important about the nature of "information". In your scenario your are distributing a syntactical media from one person to another via a process,albeit a not particulalrly interesting one ( you walking across a room ),the object of the exercise being to deliver semantic content from out resident poet to your Chinese speaking listener.  In exactly the same way a computer delivers semantical content from programmer to user : it adds no semantical content of its own at all, which is the basis of the Chinese Room argument. 
<br>
The Chinese Room argument is also not about consciousness. It is about computing and how syntax can under no circumstance generate semantic : how , in other words, 'matter properties', as you put them, can never be generated from their representations. There is no doubt WHATSOEVER that consciousness is a matter property : but matter properties are semantical and not syntactical. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John B Davey,
<br>
<br>
I know you were responding to John K Clark with your post, but allow me to walk a very fine line.
<br>
<br>
If sufficiently complex algorithmically-based entities could access "senses" (light, sound unpredictable experience from "others"), and could also "mate" (ala genetic algorithms, sharing/inheriting traits and capabilities), compete with similar algorithms having similar "non-determinist sensory input", and could thus effect unbounded evolution, ... then I am not sure that "semantic" could not be "generated".  At least, if "we" truly generate semantic, as opposed to merely integrating and transforming environmental noise into new forms, and calling it semantic because it pleases us.
<br>
<br>
Thus, I do not say that "something mind-like" might not erupt from an algorithmic basis (perhaps needing access to QM indeterminacy in some way as "input", to keep itself from falling into attractor basins.)  It might display "superior intelligence", and even lay claim to acting "creatively", appreciating nuance, etc.
<br>
<br>
That is why I say that we would have no right to deny its own claim to consciousness (if it made such a claim to us, and convinced us through its behaviors.)
<br>
<br>
However ... it may not have the "consciousness experience" as we have come to experience it.  Whether this should be inmportant to anyone is really the question.
<br>
<br>
Those who hope to "upload their consciousness" into a new substrate might feel concerned, because they imagine that "they" would want to continues "experiencing awakeness" (so to speak.)  But I feel this is based upon the fallacy that there is any such beast as "continuity of consciousness".  Consciousness, or the "conscious I", is a "sensation of the moment", and such an "I" never lasts more than a moment.  In this sense, the "I" that writes these words will never experience waking up tomorrow morning.  Rather, a "new I" wakes up, and believes itself to be a continuation of "the same consciousness" because of the common memory context.
<br>
<br>
In other words, even if I can successfully upload "my mind" into a new machine, "I" never go anywhere.  The "I" that performed the upload never gets to find out whether the uploaded "I" is, or is not conscious, no matter how well it might behave to other observers.  Just as the "I" that types at this keyboard never finds out whether a "new I" continues tomorrow or not.

<br>
So, in this respect, to whom should it matter whether the "uploaded minds" are actually conscious in the way we experience waking consciousness, or merely behave as if such subjective sensation is present?
<br>
<br>
Could they not be just as "productive"?

You write:
<br>
<br>
- "It seems pretty clear that information processing can produce something that's starting to look like intelligence, but we'll assume that Process X [assumed requisite for consciousness] can do this too, and in addition Process X can generate consciousness and a feeling of self, something mere information processing can not do. 
<br>
<br>
Another possibility is that "Process X" accesses, is "sensitive to", or interfaces with the information-processing system (say, the neural signalling complex) but cannot "do" the information processing on its own.  Otherwise, your "Process X" is de-facto complex because the term "includes" the information-processing complexities, as opposed to being some resonance-manifestation ancillary to the particular physics of the information processing activity.
<br>
<br>
- "What Process X does is certainly not simple, so it's very hard to avoid concluding that Process X itself is not simple."
<br>
<br>
That depends upon what you attribute to "Process X".
<br>
<br>
Let me offer one of my patented "Very Poor Analogies":
<br>
<br>
Suppose you have a Ziljan cymbal, such as might be part on an expensive percussion/drum set.  You strike it simultaneously near its center with a padded wooden mallet, and on its edge opposed by 113 degrees by a small steel rod.
<br>
<br>
The harmonics that are set up are enormously complex, shifting and modulating with an ever-changing sonic character.
<br>
<br>
Suppose we fashion a "paper cymbal", capable of supporting no such vibrations at all, but we attach a few billion tiny actuators to its paper surface, tiny needles each with their own "piston action".  We might be able, through sufficient programming, to signal all of these actuators such that the paper manifests "vibrations" that appear to match that of the Ziljan cymbal, but an awful lot of information would need to be generated and delivered.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, it was "easy" to have the real cymbal sustain these effects, due to the physics of the real medium.  You might argue that pressure waves propagating through the metal molecular matrix act as "information", phonon propagation from and between the inter-molecular binding forces.  But that is still quite a stretch from a billion actuators that must receive signals algorithmically generated from afar.
<br>
<br>
I liken the sense of consciousness to the shifting harmonies of the physical cymbal.  Complex to map in detail, but not complex in actual "mechanism".
<br>

Well let me put you out of your misery. There is no no need for science to 'prove' that algorithms can't create consciosuness : logic and epistemology work well just fine . 
<br>
Its as absurd to suggest that modelling a brain reproduces a brain ( via representing it ) as to say that modelling an electron via a mathematical model reproduces an electron. That , pretty much, is it. If you don't understand this elementary difference between non-mental 'stuff' such as electrons, neutrons and bits of wood, consciosness, noises from a car exhaust ,for instance -  and mental,syntactical, observer-relative 'stuff' such as 'processes','algorithms', 'computation' you will remain forever trying to bash square bits of wood into round holes.And forget complexity , its a load of hogwash. Each complex algorithm can be reduced to a larger number of very simple ones by the very definition of algorithmic mathematics  in any case - the complexity argument, weak as it is, doesn't even add up on mathematical grounds.

I can stare at a block of atoms in my desk and elude a supremely complex algorithm from their vibrartions, but that doesn't mean to say my desk is thinking.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John B,
<br>
<br>
I agree that modeling/simulating an explosion is not the same as a physical one.
<br>
<br>
But place yourself for a moment in a world where entities with consciousness exist in "some other physical substrate".  One of them is a scientist who postulates that some myriad of atoms, arranged so to form a theoretical carbon-based life, with a concentration of neurons in a "brain", might engender mind and consciousness.  A colleague says no, that construction would merely be supporting a conflux of signals that might "simulate" mind and consciousness (or conscious-like behaviors.)  If the first scientist actually went ahead and produced these carbon-based forms, (like you and me), the other scientist still need not be convinced that were are conscious, but merely behaving so.
<br>
<br>
I honestly do not know how consciousness arises, of course, so I cannot say what forms of substrate might support such experience.
<br>
<br>
But my analogy of the "cymbal" can be extended.  We must agree that the ersatz "paper cymbal" with its billion tiny programmed actuators, if able to manifest the precise complex of vibrations that the real-metal cymbal display, would produce the same "sound" (what an external observer gets to judge).  Moreover, the actuators could also be programmed to vibrate the "paper cymbal" in ways that the metal one might never be able to support, no matter how it was struck.  This is perhaps analogous to the recognition that we could produce AI that was "smarter, more capable, and even more creative" than ourselves.  But no matter how the paper was vibrated, it would not be reproducing the actual intermolecular forces that occured in the metal cymbal.
<br>
<br>
The proposition (neither proven nor disproven, simply offered) is that consciousness my be likened to some artifact of the phonon propagation occurring in the metal cymbal, and absent in the paper cymbal, no matter how sophisticated the noises from the paper cymbal might be.
<br>
<br>
And none of this says that there cannot be a non-biological manifestation of conscious experience.  However, not every physics employed to effect the model can be treated equally.  Most of all, modeling only "intelligent behavior", even if manifest of creativity and unexpected adaptability, is not the same as modeling a consciouness-as-we-experience-it.
<br>
<br>
I surmise that such cannot be ascertained by any external means.  It is inescapably a subjective valuation.
<br>
<br>
Why do I assume that other people have a conscious-waking experience as I have?  I cannot prove they do, but I recognize that they are made of the "same stuff", born in the "same way", etc., as I manifest, thus it will naturally be the default assumption.  It would be pure solipsism to assume that I am really conscious, while other people are merely "cleverly behaving as if conscious".
<br>
<br>
But when we produce powerful and self-adaptive AI, in all manner of substrates, we lose this default assumption.  We cannot "identify" with such entities, and have no reason OTHER than behaviors to infer the presence of "wakeful awareness" as humans experience it.
<br>

<br>
<br>
That would have to be my "safe assumption" as well.  I reason that, it either is, or is not, and what are the consequnces of my behaviors toward it in either case.
<br>
<br>
If it behaves consciously, but somehow is not, they I "mistakenly" respect the "rights" of a non-sentient.  No big deal.
<br>
<br>
If it actually is conscious, and I treat it as a brick, I would be doing harm to a sentient, which I hold to be a great big deal.
<br>
<br>
My discourse on the possible "ancillary physics" of the substrate, above algorithmic processing, in the support of consciousness (as we experience it) is intended more to address the concerns of those that  might hope to "transfer themselves" into a "new computronium substrate".  If one could only do this as an all-or-nothing leap, one would like some additional assurance that the new substrate would support, at least (if not more than) our current experience of consciousness, as opposed to being a receptical that merely allowed our mind-logic plus memories to drive outwardly convincing behaviors.

One other thing, if behavior can not indicate consciousness then why on earth did evolution produce it? However important consciousness may be to us from evolution's point of view only intelligent external behavior is important. If the two are always linked or at least if one is a shortcut for the other then we will find it easier to make a intelligent conscious computer than a intelligent non conscious computer.  If the two are not linked then you need to resort to miracles to explain how it ever appeared on this planet.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>A standard confusion about consciousness relates to issues about 'proof', reasonable beliefs, and a constant never-ending confusion of subjective experrience with objective facts . 
<br>
The fact that your conscious experience is subjective in NATURE does not exclude it from being the objective fact of your consideration. You have no proof of a lot of things you can't know through the senses : atoms, molecules and electrons are all based upon assumptions about the nature of matter : no formal logical proof can be made for their existence : the existence of atoms is based upon faith in science and constitiutes what philosophers would call a 'reasonable belief'.
<br>
 When placing your consciousness in the universe of objective facts you must make a case for your own uniqueness ( in absolute terms ) in order to make an OBJECTIVE assertion of the denial of consciosuness in others. If you assume  a) you are not the only human in the universe and b)most human beings are similar  , then you have no conclusion to come to other than if you have consciousness, then so must everybody else. 
<br>
This is the difference between looking at the subjective of experience of consciousness and its analysis in epistemological terms. To say that 'i can only be sure of my own consciousness' is correct if and only if you also maintain that you don't think there are more people than yourself in the universe constitutes a 'reasonable belief'. Personally I don't think that I am the only person in the universe : I don't consider it a reasonable belief : so I don't consider it a reasonable belief to assume I can't say it exists in others, if I can say that "grass is green" or "rotten eggs smell" or "he is black".
<br>
One thing is for sure : unlike brains we know PRECISELY how computers work : they work via observer-relative mechanical implementations : they don't have a physical existence. As mental events are semantical and not syntactical , this means that you can never, ever generate mental events from computation, no more than you can produce bricks, wind, electrons, planets, or any other form of matter , or any other semantical components of the universe such as time and space.
<br>
Computers cant be conscious because you cant make apples from oranges, and it really is quite as simple as that.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John B,
<br>
<br>
You write, "As mental events are semantical and not syntactical"
<br>
<br>
Other than pure faith, how do you know that we entertain semantic, and not merely perform something "akin to" sophisticated transformations of "environmental inputs" to "outputs"?  I tend to think that our "processing" is not purely causal (if that is what you mean by "mechanical") but how is semantic more than a "claim"?  We may feel that we generate semantic (and I feel that we do, perhaps unprovably).  But that is not something that could be said to be "obvious".
<br>
<br>
Surely, there is no reason to hold that a future artificial brain, formed perhaps of a dense matrix of silicone gel, carbon nanotubes, and tea leaves, with sensory i/o to the world, "simply cannot manifest a conscious intelligent state".
<br>
<br>
I agree that, although we can "interpret" (model) our brains (at least, their intelligent-like behaviors) to be performing "syntactic symbol manipulation", that does not mean they are merely manipulating symbols.  Thus, a greatly sophisticated "future symbol processor" might not necessarily support the "sense of consciousness" we feel subjectively.  But that is NOWHERE the say as saying that no artificially constructed system, which might employ symbol processing in part, cannot become a conscious individual, essentially a person.
<br>
<br>
There is no basis for supposing that our physical manifestation is the only one that "works", nor that we are more than physical manifestation.
<br>
<br>
As far as "quacks like a duck":
<br>
<br>
Difficult as the engineering might be, we can posit that an artificial person, as in "Data" from Star Trek, might someday exist.  Even if given the same original "programming" (for want of a better term) three individual Data might diverge in behaviors as they re-adjust their own programming (beliefs if you like) and "experience" different histories.  All three, I would assume, would avoid walking into a blast furnace, surmising that this would not help them to fulfill some sense of a long-term mission.  As outside observers, we might say "they fear their own destruction", even though we really would have no idea of what they might feel, or fear.
<br>
<br>
Along the banks of a raging river, a crowd gathers, including these three "Data".  A mother screams as her child is swept away by the current.  The crowd, and two of the Data, hold back, but one of the Data leaps into the water, risking being swept away, to attempt to rescue the child.
<br>
<br>
Folks might say, "That was a brave thing to do" (or a foolish thing).  We have no idea whether the other two Data were reluctant because (a) they feared their own destruction, or (b) they calculated risk &gt; reward, or (c) something else.
<br>
<br>
I would call the rescuer brave, since I could not know either way what, if anything, this artificial person "felt".
<br>
<br>
It quacks like a duck.  Call it a duck.
<br>
<br>
Cheers! ____tony b____

<br>
This statement is so ridiculous/bizarre I don't even know where to begin. Why don't strong AI enthusaists use one useful English word instead of twenty useless ones ?
<br>
Now there's an example - English - that's semantic. If you don't know what the word means, buy a dictionary. Buy a dictionary anyway.
<br>
Without semantic there is no language - without semantic there would be no conversation. This sentence would mean nothing to you. On the other hand a lot of your sentences use words with only vague connections to semantical objects hence the distinct impression a lot of what you speak doesn't actually mean anything : this is the difference between syntax and semantic.
<br>
If all language were syntactical it would have nothiong to refer to and no damn 'inputs' and 'outputs' to identify in the first place as all you would have is a spaceless, timeless, matterless world.
<br>
There is NOTHING to stop consciosness from possibly appearing in alternatice physical forms than brains , or 'substrates' as you call them. I wouldn't seek to deny it : I don't seek to deny that artificial consciosuness is a possibility . What is definitely and most certainly a probability is that compuattiional syntax vapour objects will never, ever create semantic.

<br>
<br>
:)
<br>
<br>
It might "mean nothing", even though I might respond to it intelligently, correct?
<br>
<br>
If a thousand monkeys bang at a keyboard and produce the phrase "I am hungry", that familiar phrase has no semantic content (we judge) because we assume (correctly, I surmise) that the monkey had no "intention" of writing what it did.  We, at least, "feel" that we "intend" when we offer communication, and upon receiving it from another, tend to hold that "other" as having "intended" what they wrote.  Thus, semantic content is an assumption, strengthened when two sides of a communication seem to be acting with a consistent "sense" of the thread of "conversation".
<br>
<br>
You tell me "I am hungry", I hear it and bring you an apple.  Since the communication you intended resulted in "successful activity on the part of the other entity", we judge that the communication conveyed "semantic".
<br>
<br>
A robot discovers it needs more "coal" and issues a request (symbols) to another robot.  If that other robot goes off and returns with more coal ... the message thus conveyed no semantic?  Curious indeed!  Did the robots need "our sense of consciousness" to effect this activity?
<br>
<br>
None of that is "proof" that semantic is more than our belief that we "intend".  I happen to belive we "intend", but my belief is no proof to anyone but me.
<br>
<br>
If (ala Turing Test) you communicate with (unknown entity), how do you judge whether the other "entity" conveys semantic, as opposed to transforms symbols in rich and complex learned ways?  How will you do so in 10 years, 20 years, as artificial symbol processing systems become far more sophisticated?
<br>
<br>
Care to elaborate?

This half-ass argument is tiresome and trundled out on a regular basis. That proper syntax is capable of being randomly generated belies the fact ( yet again) that syntax has arbitrary forms and thus incapable of generating semantic and meaning.  
<br>

<br>
Impossible. A robot never needs anything, because its a computer and computers don't need anything because they're symbol processors : they don't even have a physical existence. The company employing the programmer needs the coal, so he formalises that requirement symblically.

This is like saying that God wanted certain work to be done, and programmed us to perform that work.  Thus we "need nothing" (who says we "need") and all we are doing by passing "semantic content" to and fro is to carry out God's instructions.
<br>
<br>
Unless you think you can prove, or disprove the existence of God, and thus the existence or non-existence of "intent" on our part, the viewpoint that we convey meaning or intent is quite a matter of faith.
<br>
<br>
We may not be simple algorithmic symbol processors, easily deconstructed into obvious mechanical parts, but unless you think that we have some magical mind-fluid that allows us somehow to entertain meaning and purpose in an objective sense, I do not understand the basis for your argument.
<br>
<br>
Question:  Just how far from a "symbol processing computer" must a device get before it is no longer "ridiculous" to entertain the possibility of its sentience?
<br>
<br>
Important:
<br>
<br>
You have noticed, it seems, that I tend to argue both sides of the fence.  If I sense someone is taking it for granted that any Turing machine (say, built of rubber band and colored marbles) running a sufficiently complex and self-evolving algorithm is thus definitively sentient when it acts with sufficient intelligence, I argue why the very physics of the processing MAY be a determining factor, at least in matching our subjective experience of what sentience "feels like".  Alternately, when someone (guess who) demands that no "machine" can be sentient because it merely passes "symbols with no semantic", I challenge you to establish how we are not machines passing symbols lacking semantic, except in terms of unsubstantiable belief on our part.
<br>
<br>
You seem to denigrate playing both sides.  Perhaps you think that discussion is about "winning" rather than spurring thought and further investigation.  Your choice of words to characterize opposing arguments (half-assed, ridiculous) are a distraction and technique of communication designed to head off further investigation of the issues.  They are a defensive reaction, and serve to sway others to your side out of fear of appearing "ridiculous" otherwise, at least in your eyes.
<br>
<br>
Then, perhaps it is just your habit of speech.

"Unless you think you can prove, or disprove the existence of God, and thus the existence or non-existence of "intent" on our part, the viewpoint that we convey meaning or intent is quite a matter of faith. "

In scientifc terms as I am making no positive assertion about the creation of consciosuness through computers I am under no obligation to prove anything. Its up to you to prove that computers can generate consciousness in scientific terms, and that starts by you having a theory of consciousness which it doesn't sound like me you've the capacity to produce.

<br>
<br>
I do not believe that is possible, which is exactly the point I am making.  When I look at what you might call the "blue sky", I may be experiencing the "color" that you (and perhaps others) call "red".  But I have learned to identify that color by the name "blue".  You might then present to me a set of colored cards and ask "which is colored blue?"  I pick the "correct" one, of course, (the one that appears "red" in my subjective experience) and blue to you, out of training.
<br>
<br>
This tells me that semantic is contextual, and not intrinsic.  We might objectively measure the wavelength and agree that "sky" and your "blue card" match.  That does not establish what I am experiencing, but only a correspondence on terms we thus deem "semantic agreement".
<br>
<br>
You object to my "coal-fetching" robot as engaging in semantic "on its own", and insist it is merely passing dead symbols to effect the semantic of the original programmer.
<br>
<br>
If the programmer had not specified "coal-fetching" per se, but rather "build more steel girders", and the (system of) robots manage to apply reason to create a steel factory, determine that coal is needed at some stage, and one "tells another" to fetch more coal, that message still contains no semantic in your view, even though it is serves to effect the gathering of more coal.
<br>
<br>
If the programmer had specified "build better cars", or "build a better physical infrastructure for human society", and some system of robots use this "simple directive" to establish factories and self-sustaining systems, you will still maintain that the directive has "semantic for the human", but was merely "symbols" to the robo-system.
<br>
<br>
Although you fail to articulate, I can only surmise that your view is based, at heart, upon the notion that "artificial stuff" is completely causally constrained, thus all artificial actions are uncreative (being always attributable to a prior-cause that can be traced back to a human at some stage) and that humans escape this very causal-void of semantic.  Somehow, "we intend X" and no artificial system can "intend".
<br>
<br>
If you felt that I was asking you to "prove something", I was not.
<br>
<br>
But I would like to know your view of how far an artificial system needs to depart from "symbol manipulation" before it might be capable of "originating intent", as you would judge it.

<br>
I can't explain "blue" without using the word blue because there would be nothing to explain.  But I can tell a blind person what the color blue means to me and what it makes me feel.
<br>
<br>
Think about that patch of skin above your nose and beneath your brow that is infinitely more sensitive than the rest of your skin.  And when the sun shines down on the back of your hand and warms it, it also shines down on that patch of skin, the eye, which sees a contrast between the warmth of the sun and the coolness of air or water.  The light from the sun creates in the eye a texture a thousand times stronger than what you feel on your hand.  We call it yellow.  The cool air creates a contrasting texture we call blue.  
<br>
<br>
The yellow of the sun we usually associate with happiness.  But sometimes the sun can be too warm.  It makes us hot and lethargic.  The coolness of water provides a refreshing contrast to the hot sun.  We associate the color we call blue with the air that flows around us and the water that quenches our thirst.  The water we swim in is also cool and blue, as is the air that stretches for miles above us.  Blue is the watery color of empty sky and rolling sea.  We are surrounded by it, even on a bright and sunny day.
<br>
<br>
In music, the sound we call blue reminds us of when we are sad -- perhaps becuse it brings to our eyes the blue water of our tears.  </p></td>

<br>
I agree that you might describe to someone what the "color of sky or water" makes you feel (cool, calm, etc).  But if that is what I subjectively experience as your color "red", then to me, it is the "cool red lake" and the "cool red sky", which I have been trained from birth to call by the name "blue".
<br>
<br>
So, perhaps John B can explain which form of "describe blue to me" he was seeking.  I suspect he sought the latter "subjective visual experience", and if so, I do not believe that it can be conveyed in any sense of the term "objective".  You say "makes me feel cool or relaxed", I say the same, so we refer to the "same thing" (color of water or sky), even though we might interpret the purely visual sensation differently.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>THis is an immensely confused response I may say. On the one hand you accept that colors cannot be explained in terms of anuthing other than thesmelves. You thus accept semantic exists , and meaning exists , a 180 degree turnaround from your presvuious suggestion . Then you claim that this is PROOF )( ie that you cannot describe a color in anything other than color terms ) that "semantic is  contextual" and somehow non-existent. At least your fudged argunment admits that semantic exists. That it is "contextual" is a misunderstanding although my personal suspicion is you're looking for a way out. 
<br>
Semantic either exists or it doesn't. Full stop. There is no logical alternative. What you are not denying in fact is the existence of semantic - you admit every individual has his 'version' of blue - you are denying that there is no such thiing as a global experrience of blue, which is a completely separate claim. That you think that everybody has  color experiences is 100% support for the idea that brains have innate semantic support. 
<br>
You may be trying to convince yourself that the hypothesis of variable sensory function  means the same thuing as 'there is no semantic in thinking' but naturally it doesn't and ( yet again ) you are confusing ontologies. If humans have color experirnces in their thinking THEN human thinking supports semantic. Full stop. That an external object ( a light ray ) has a slightly different sensory impact on one individual as opposed to another is utterly and completely irrelevant , and a huge red herring. The key point is that the mental event of color experience in ALL humans has one feauture about it : it is semantical . 
<br>
<br>
The other point to obviously make is that there is no reason to assume that most people DO see color particulalrly differently. In fact we know that about 8% of males see them different as they are color blind. But the whole point is we know about color blindness. That every individual may be wandering around in a completely different sensory space is not backed up by experience : we can quickly tell if color interpretations differ from OBJECTIVE tests. There is no reason to assume either that there are vast differences between humans in mental life, that a punch in the face hurts some humans but others feel happy.

<br>
I'm afraid you are hoisting yourself by your own petard here, in addition to being confused. Nobody is talking about consciousness detection systems here : none has been invented (yet) although there is no fundamental reason why one should not be. What is at discussion here is the question of objective belief about consciousness . That you may believe of not believe somebody is conscious at a particular point in time due to their actions is not the same question as 'is it a reasonable belief to assume I am the only conscious person in the world ?'. 
<br>
AI enthusiasts try to have their cake and eat it. They try to say on the one hand that consciouness of other people and animals is judged by their external behaviour, on the other that as it is undetectable in others all we need to do is create externaly manifested conscious behaviour and het presto ! as we can't prove he ISN'T conscious, we must assume that he is. 
<br>
It is important to note that this line if argument is unscientific drivel of the most bogus kind and some individuals have been living off it for years.
<br>
In the first place the case rests on consciousness being unobjectively testable, and that this restriction is inaliable. This is a false assumption and belies a colossal ignorance of science. Consciousness has a first party , subjective quality but that doesn't stop it from being a third party phenomenon of the universe and thus the subject of scintific hypothesis. Given a theory of consciousness ( relating to MATTER , and not 'process') then detection of consciousness would be perfectly possible via the usual hypothesis/experimentation/verification route used in all other branches of science and physics. The only restriction on measuring consciousness is a complete absence of consciousness theories.
<br>
The other point is this  : if I say on the one hand that I only know that other people are conscious because of the way they behave, then  I already have a personal theory of other peoples' consciousness based upon their being like me. But what I have is a theory of the STATE of that person's consciousness : not his CAPACITY to be conscious, which I've assumed is implicit in him being a human being and pretty much like me. This is by any stretch of the imagination a reasonable belief. So your behaviour theory of consciousness state in humans is predicated on one assumption : other human beings have the capacity to be conscious. 
<br>
Now when we change focus on the computer we see a bolt change in argument. There is no reason to assume that a block of silicon has the capcity to be conscious. So we get this facile response : how do we know its not conscious, particularly if he behaves like it? After all, we only know a human is conscious because of his behaviour . Not so ! You assume a person is conscious because he's like you : that's it. His behaviour relates merely to your personal theory of consciousness STATE. You  associate conscious behaviours with certain acts, such as speaking, laughing and (in the case of dogs , for instance ) barking. But its YOU who makes the connection between the behaviour and the idea that the possessor of the behaviour may be conscious :  YOUR theory is PREDICATED upon the reasonable belief that other humans and to a lesser extent animals are pretty much like yourself. You can't suddenly switch your domain to boxes of silicon, which you don't have any reasonable belief are like you, and suddenly say 'if I get animal behaviour from a box if silicon i can apply the same theories about consciousness that I apply to humans and animals' because computers AREN'T humans or animals. The argument is all washed up and based upon confused notions of theory and proof.
<br>
<br>
"Not so. It would only take a few minutes to write a computer program to search for an even number greater than 4 that is not the sum of two odd primes, that is all the primes except 1 and 2, and then stop. What will this simple little program do, will it ever stop? I don't know, you don't know, nobody knows. "
<br>
<br>
This does not imply in any way, shape or form that we don't know how computers work. Computer programs that never stop are still working in the same way as ones that do.

Don't be silly, of course it does. You may understand how a flip flop switch works but that doesn't mean you understand how this computer works anymore than knowing how to type means you understand Shakespeare. You don't understand something if you don't know what it will do, in the example I gave the only way to know what the computer will do is watch it and see. I think you are the one confused about the semantical and the syntactical.

<br>
Well we certainly don't understand the car's trajectory I'll tell you that, and in my example we not only don't know when it will stop we don't even know if it will stop. Unlike the car the computer is constantly changing its internal logical state and there is no shortcut to figure out how it is changing, you must simply watch it and see. To say there is no mystery in this situation because you understand how a flip flop circuit works is foolish.

When you remove the six dollar words, what you are saying is this:

If we do not know how a process will end, we cannot understand it.

Were this to be true, we couldn't understand most of what happens in the world.

I can write a simple cellular automata program which will exhibit behavior that is, for all intents and purposes, completely random from now until the day the sun becomes a red giant.  I will never be able to predict precisely what happens, but I understand the program completely.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>BC,
<br>
<br>
I understand your point, as one of degree.  Let us compare and contrast the brain with (at least today's) sophisticated computer.
<br>
<br>
I agree that it is unfair to simply compare our understanding of chemistry yet lack of understanding of mind/consciousness, to our understanding of computer substrate and lack of knowing the end-state of a complex process.
<br>
<br>
With even the most complex "program over processor", we could in principle do every step with pencil and paper.  It would simply take a very long time.  In this case, at least, we understand both the "base operations" and in principle how all consequences must follow.
<br>
<br>
Today, even if we completely understand all of the rules of chemistry, we cannot take paper and pencil and arrive reliably at the future state of a brain, even in terms of future chemical state, no less ferret what "thoughts" that brain might be entertaining.
<br>
<br>
The issue is one of "destiny in principle".  If we know the state of every atmospheric molecule (and the flapping wings of every butterfly, methaphorically) AND the physics of the universe were deterministic (No Strong QM) then we could, in principle, calculate all future weather.  Dense, moist air at location X would imply a hot muggy day at location X.
<br>
<br>
But calculating ALL future ionic concentrations in the brain, and the sequence of every future neural cascade, still does not tell us what that brain might be "thinking".  We might INFER that it is entertaining fear or happiness or anger, because the concentrations or activity correlate strongly so, but we have no way to be certain that the "consciousness" feels as such, at least until we have a very amazingly complete theory of consciousness. 
<br>
<br>
So the issue becomes, if we succeed eventually to understand everything about the brain mechanics, even to the point of (again, in principle) affording a "pencil and paper" calculation of what that brain will be "thinking", then as a consequence, our "thoughts" are just as "mechanically uncreative and uncapable of (objective) semantic" as the microprocessor supported algorithm.  We may not know what the original program looked like, but the current state-of-the-algorithm would be sufficient to calculate all future state.
<br>
<br>
In such a case, our "sensation of conveying meaning" by our thoughts and actions would be a form of self-delusion.  We would be merely "robots fetching coal", to draw upon the post I made to John B.
<br>
<br>
How are we, in principle, to escape this cold, mechanical conclusion?
<br>
<br>
A) "We cannot figure out the brain to that degree".
<br>
<br>
So we get to maintain forever that there is some "inexplicable reason" that WE entertain real meaning, as opposed to carrying out some chemical destiny written long before we were born, whereas the most sophisticated algorithmic systems cannot entertain real meaning, because they are fully explicable, and must carry out the algorithmic destiny of their original programming.
<br>
<br>
B) "We figure out the brain perfectly, including a correct theory of consciousness, but still cannot predict what a brain today will be thinking tomorrow, even in principle, because we understand how it exploits fundamental QM-indeterminacy."
<br>
<br>
This would suggest that a deterministic algorithm cannot "generate semantic", but one that might exploit QM-indeterminacy is a sufficiently similar way may give rise to a conscious, semantic-generating system, a "mindful being".
<br>
<br>
C) "The voice of God booms from the Heavens that He gave us mind and will and meaning, and we all believe Him (or Her.)"
<br>
<br>
Not much to gain in further discussion of consciousness in that case.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Thoughts?

I never said anything of the sort. You commented that weather, I recall, was , difficult to predict and hence its mechanisms not 'understood' somehow. I pointed out weather was difficult to predict for one reason : too much initial informatuion required , so a random element is always present in weather behaviour, You had tried in a half-hearted way to compare the progress of the weather with a computer program. Something completely invalid as an isolated computer prgram is 100% determinsitic, as I said.

They use the same letters in France - are you as familar with the works of Proust ? You need more than an understanding of syntax to get a grasp of semantic.

You seem like an intelligent fellow, so I am interested in your opinions.  I pose a few questions, and would like to hear your views.
<br>
<br>
1.  Do you think that it is possible to attain a theory of consciousness sufficient to explain "mind and thought" in terms of the properties of physics, or do you think there is some insurmountable barrier to such a theory?
<br>
<br>
2.  If a theory of mind/consciousness were attained, and shown to be a pure consequence of physics, would this make our actions "completely determined" (ala, analogous to algorithm) or can we somehow "originate thought or action" (free will, so to speak.)
<br>
<br>
3.  If we are "as if algorithmically determined" (by consequences of chemistry, etc.,) then would our "sense of entertaining semantic" be anything more than "our sense of it".  That is, would semantic be "in the mind of the beholder"?
<br>
<br>
4.  How far from a pure "symbol-processing automaton" must a thing be before it can be considered an "intentional actor"?

<br>
Physics gives an account of matter but it does not explain it.So physics can give us an account of what matter DOES but not what matter IS. To that extent physics is a syntactical discipline that jumps off a boatload of semantic 'givens'. One 'given' is time : time is never explained by physics in terms of itself : it is merely represented formally in mathematical statements. If time /matter / space are  "de-semanticized" by physics its usually into a form of grand semantic such as mass-energy. Physics refers  to its semantic elements as dimensions and these represent the limits of its capacity to explain. So the simple answer is no , I don't think there is a syntactical expression of that will lead naturally to the conclusion that people can think. Semantic cannot be DERIVED from physics. But there may well be a syntactical expression of 
<br>
some kind that gets ASSOCIATED with thinking. This is, in fact, all physics tends to do in any case. The charge of an electron is not derived from base principles, its a semantic idea produced by human beings after a lot of experimentation and hypothesis.
<br>
"2. If a theory of mind/consciousness were attained, ..thought or action" (free will, so to speak.) 
<br>
Don't know. I suspect that the problem may well lie in the question somewhere.We have predeterminstic assumpotions about physics currently. They may well turn out to be incomplete.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. If we are "as if algorithmically determined" (by consequences of chemistry, 
<br>
Chemistry is about stuff. Real, semantic stuff. That there are laws about chemicals does not make us algorithmically determined. It makes us chemically determined.
<br>
<br>
"then would our "sense of entertaining semantic" be anything more than "our sense of it". 
<br>
No . Wrong ontologies , you're getting confused. "Sense" in this context is not a physical sense but a logical one. We have non-physical semantic too - the idea of other people being the most obvious example. 
<br>
<br>
"4. How far from a pure "symbol-processing automaton" must a thing be before it can be considered an "intentional actor"? "
<br>
<br>
This is a question akin to : "when did you stop beating your wife ? " : its base assumptions are erroneous but nonethless requires a binary response. The answer is very simple : a symbol processor doesn't physically exist so doesn't even belong in the realm of intentional actors , so the problem lies in the question - which assumes there is some kind of boundary between the two, which there is not.

<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; 1. Do you think that it is possible to attain a theory of consciousness sufficient .." in terms of the properties of physics, ..there is some insurmountable barrier to such a theory? "
<br>
<br>
&gt; ... the simple answer is no , I don't think there is a syntactical expression of that will lead naturally to the conclusion that people can think. Semantic cannot be DERIVED from physics.
<br>
<br>
I would agree that theories of physics are generally axiomatic constructs, such that "selected premises" lead to derivable consequences that will match physical observations.  But are you implying that expressions of theory are merely syntactic?
<br>
<br>
However "artificial" or syntactic all theories of physics may be, they generally lead to our ability to predict with greater accuracy.  It would seem that we could "predict all future thoughts" given a sufficiently effective theory (not practical, but in principle.)  It is not practical, at least, because of the amount of "state" that would need to be known with accuracy, so that issue is not interesting.
<br>
<br>
My second and third questions were related:  (2) Would an "in principle" theory, or understanding that we were purely "consequences of physics" reduce us to "non-willful beings", and (3) How could non-willful beings "mean anything" (intend semantic) by their utterings.
<br>
<br>
Apologies if I did not word them as clearly.
<br>
<br>
I happen to hold that we are willful, that we can "originate intent".  If otherwise, then I meant exactly the "sensory" sense of "sense" (whew) when I implied that our "sense of engaging in semantic" would be a joke, as it were.  I cannot fathom how the words I might utter tomorrow can bear a semantic that "I intend", if they were in fact completely determined a century ago by the state of the universe.  Fortunately, our understanding of physics leads us to find it not strictly determined.
<br>
<br>
Even so, it would seem that, as I wrote, semantic is in the eye of he beholder.  Hypothesize an advanced race of beings that happen upon us, and judge us to be "robots".  They have no particular reason to establish we are conscious, intentional, or willful.  Our messages (written, voice, etc.) are fancy symbols being passed about as we go about our business "fetching coal".
<br>
<br>
One might argue (taking the omniscient view) that our "symbols" convey semantic because "we consciously intend them" to convey a specific meaning, instruction, or directive.
<br>
<br>
In this view, "semantic" and "conscious intent" become synonymous.  If two artificially constructed "beings" pass messages between themselves, they are "conscious" IFF "they pass semantic".
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; 4. How far from a pure "symbol-processing automaton" must a thing be before it can be considered an "intentional actor"?
<br>
<br>
&gt; "its base assumptions are erroneous but nonethless requires a binary response. The answer is very simple : a symbol processor doesn't physically exist so doesn't even belong in the realm of intentional actors."
<br>
<br>
Binary response?  It was not a "yes or no" question.  I asked "how far from", not "how big and complex need it be."
<br>
<br>
I think that "algorithm" (as an abstract logical description) and "robot with processors effecting algorithms" (effecting physical consequences) are indeed two different beasts.  I have argued on this list that a Turing machine running a billion lines of sophisticated, self-modifying code, does nothing more than I could to with pencil, paper, and a great deal of spare time.
<br>
<br>
But a "robot" (or whatever we might artificially construct that employs algorithms in some degree) is not an isolated system.  A robot is rather useless without some way of interacting with the rest of the physical world.  It might have visual systems, aural systems, tactile systems, as well as adaptively learn from dealing with its unpredictable surroundings.  In this sense, is it still merely a symbol-processing automaton?
<br>
<br>
If yes, is this because its behaviors are "determined"?  This begins to seem a stretch of the word "determined", since two such robots, "raised" in different surroundings and "experiencing" (intentional quotations) different situations, would end up adapting differently, drawing different inferences, etc.  Their subsequent "predictability" is no more predictable than the weather.
<br>
<br>
Would this (plus evidence of their intelligence) demand they be conscious?  I don't think it is demanded, no.
<br>
<br>
But at some point of sophistication, the term "robot" becomes unnecesarily perjorative, suggesting the simple mechanical man.  One can no longer argue that it is all simply "determined behavior" due to the mechanical nature of its physical logic gates, unless we are merely "determined behavior" due to the mechanical nature of chemistry.
<br>
<br>
Is there a scale across which this "physical manifestation called robot" and "intentional actor" meet?
<br>

I think you are getting once more into the confused mire of proof/disproof of internal mental life from an external viewpoint. This really is a colossal non-point. The viewpoint of external observers is totally, completely irrelevant to the discussion. If we assume that there exists such a thing as internal mental life AS an objective feature of the universe, then how it is detected is not remotely relevant to the issues around it. We assume its existence from the outset of our theorising, in much the same way we assume matter exists before conducting physical experiments. It doesn't matter what robots / aliens/ god knows what/ may think, no more than a man from a distance thinks something is a duck when it is in fact a painting of a duck.

Wrong. There is no law of logic that demands every effect have a cause and when modern physics looks at a tritium atom and sees it decay there is no reason it did so right now and not an hour from now or a century from now. True randomness does exist.

Utter nonsense. Truie randomness does exist but that doesn't contradict the principles of cause and effect. What quantum states is that we can't know the exact position AND velocity of a particle at any point and so the movements of particles in force fields are indeterminstic. The 'cause' and 'effect' parameters in these examples are intranuclear forces  - its merely the simultaneous measurement of position and velocity that causes problems.

Ok, let me get this straight, something is random but it is still caused by something. Oh well, it's not the first time you said something that didn't make sense.

<br>
'The 'cause' and 'effect' parameters in these examples are intranuclear forces' 
<br>

<br>
If you think these 'intranuclear forces' of yours (I assume you mean the weak nuclear force and beta decay) can explain why one tritium atom will decay now and another identical tritium atom will not decay for a century then I can only conclude that you have not read a book about physics published in the last 70 years. I should be accustomed to it by now but it still amazes me when people feel confident to make grand philosophical proclamations and yet are ignorant of basic high school science.

I have a degree in physics if you must know. Which is why I know that cause and effect still apply in quantum systems ( it'd be dreadfully difficult to do any calculations otherwise ) , and whose particle positions and momemta are governed by the uncertainty principle, making it impossible to know which particles are going to decay. Its really not that difficult and doesn't counter the idea of cause and effect : in fact you can have a good stab at deriving the half life of nuclei from first principles using simple force field mathematics,thermodynamics and aggrgegation , a la conventional statistical physics from the mechanics of gases.

This will give you an overview of intranuclear forces and the cause of nuclear decay. The reason that you can't tell one atom is going to decay rather than another is because you can't know the exact position AND velocity of a particle simultaneously, the fundamental principle of MEASUREMENT that is quantum mechanics. Cause and effect still apply : if they didn't 70 years of non-stop theoretical development of the  quantum meachanics of bodies in force fields has all been a waste of time.

'The reason that you can't tell one atom is going to decay rather than another is because you can't know the exact position AND velocity of a particle simultaneously, the fundamental principle of MEASUREMENT that is quantum mechanics. Cause and effect still apply '  
<br>
<br>
But it's much deeper than just a measurement problem. Take the old 2 slit experiment for example, it's not that the photon goes through
<br>
one slit and we just don't know which one, it must go through the left slit only, and the right slit only, and both slits, and no slit at all, and it must do all these things at the same time.
<br>
<br>
Shine a light on 2 closely spaced slits and it will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, even if the light beam is so weak the
<br>
photons (or any other particle) are sent out one at a time. If a particle goes through one slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit,
<br>
the one it didn't go though, was there or not, but it does.
<br>
<br>
Even stranger, place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and one set at  90 degrees over the other, the interference pattern disappears.Now place a third filter set at 45 degrees one inch in front of the film and
<br>
10 light years from the slits. The interference pattern comes back, even though you didn't decide to put the filter in front of the film until 10 years after the photons passed the slits! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does
<br>
not enter into any of this. Quantum Mechanics may or may not be a good idea but one thing is certain, it's the law.

Mr. Davey the points I made were very definitely not pigswill, I was accurately describing the way the world works, if you have a problem with that then don't blame me, blame God. I'm sure you could have done a better job than He did but unfortunately the position was already taken.

That doesn't make sense; this experiment clearly shows it is not just a measurement problem. You seemed rather bored with the 2 slit problem and even compared it to a pop up book, but others have had a great deal more respect for it. No less a person than Richard Feynman was very impressed by it, he said it was 'a phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.  In reality, it contains the only mystery ... the basic peculiarities of all quantum mechanics.'
<br>
<br>
There is one other quotation of interest this one by Niels Bohr 'Anybody who is not shocked by Quantum Mechanics does not understand it'.  Mr. Davey you do not appear to find anything shocking in the 2 slit experiment, hmm.

It's at least this real causality between decaying and accelerating. You can preserve 100 radium atoms against decay. Just accelerate them enough for a billion years. And they will still be like new. ;)

<br>
You fastidiously avoid addressing the issue of artificial sentience, which seems to be the central theme to most of the posts made in this thread.  Such artifice need not be purely "the algorithm in abstraction", but as an element of a physical manifestation (e.g., "robot").
<br>
<br>
The issue is not whether a simulated rainstorm, however accurately modeled, will require that I grab an umbrella.
<br>
<br>
I don't happen to feel that a Pentium 4, plus "cool algorithm", acting in concert, represents what I would consider a "sentient entity" (or "intentional actor").  You would appear to agree with this position.
<br>
<br>
Yet I ask, wherein lies the difficulty-in-principle, of producing artificial sentience (or that which would be indistiguishable from sentient artificial intelligence)?
<br>
<br>
1.  Is this simply a matter of degree, lack of sufficient complexity, parallelism, or real-world interactions?
<br>
<br>
2.  Is it that the "state of the system" (despite variable outside interference) is in principle "explicable"?
<br>
<br>
3.  Is it that siliconic "logic gates" are not mushy and grey enough?
<br>
<br>
4.  Is it that it would lack a "soul"?
<br>
<br>
5.  Is it Something Else?
<br>
<br>
You are good at taking pot-shots, and yet are reluctant to stand up even a straw man of your own.  Surely you must have conjectures of your own to make on this issue.  Why not reveal them?
<br>

Give me an example.
<br>
<br>
"..which seems to be the central theme to most of the posts made in this thread. Such artifice need not be purely "the algorithm in abstraction", but as an element of a physical manifestation (e.g., "robot"). "
<br>
<br>
A robot does not exist other than as an "algorithm in abstraction". A robot is a functional entity , not a physical one. A robot delivers "service" for want of a better word. It has an arbitrary physical implementation. What you may seem to be suggesting is that the syntactcical "service" components as defined by the observer ( robot user ) are somehow  conferred onto/into the physical device implementing the "service" requirements. 
<br>
Impossible.
<br>
<br>
"Yet I ask, wherein lies the difficulty-in-principle, of producing artificial sentience (or that which would be indistiguishable from sentient artificial intelligence)? "
<br>
None. If those artificial factors have the causal powers to create consciousness , then they have the power to create consciousness. My personal belief is that biologists have the only identifiable access to those causal powers : namely brain tissue. If anybody synthesises consciousness/thinking in the near future it will be them . On the other hand syntactical objects have no causal powers whatsoever, because they are abstract.
<br>
<br>
"1. Is this simply a matter of degree, lack of sufficient complexity, parallelism, or real-world interactions? "
<br>
Forget algorithms and other syntactical objects. They don't have physical existence, which thinking and consciousness do. There is no capacity for the interaction of the two.
<br>
<br>
"You are good at taking pot-shots, and yet are reluctant to stand up even a straw man of your own. Surely you must have conjectures of your own to make on this issue. Why not reveal them? "
<br>
You are constrained by the limitations of your own argument set. You think that anybody who doesn't believe that computers can generate mental events must be motivated by religious motives. In fact I happen to think that the religious case, though clearly contrary to my point of view , makes more consistent sense than the AI case as at least an all-powerful deity would have causal powers, were he/she/it to exist. What makes AI so bizarre is the maintenance of its adherents that observer-relative syntactical objects DO have causal powers , which is totally nonsensical.

The answer to the question, not that it remotely affects the objective existence of consciousness and so is MONSTROUSLY irrelevant, is simple. The robot is not conscious. The robot is lying - or it would be , if he had the capacity for intentionality, which it doesn't. For the simple reason that our 'intelligent, man-made' function server

<br>
I might argue:
<br>
<br>
"The 2-slit experiment means that cause and effect don't apply (at QM levels of activity) because to assume that a (hidden) "cause" exists would imply that, in principle, there are "variables and values" (however inaccessible) that if they could be known, would render the universe entirely deterministic, and leads to statistics on QM observations (via Bell's Theorem) that would differ to arbitrary degree from the observed statistics."
<br>
<br>
Alternately, I might argue against fundamental QM-indeterminacy using the inscrutable John-B method:
<br>
<br>
"Behavior at the QM-level is still cause and effect, because, well, everything has to have a cause!  It is so obvious, only an idiot would think otherwise, duh!"
<br>
<br>
Likewise, your only ability to elicidate why "machine-consciousness" is impossible (different ontologies) is that it is "obviously" different ontologies, which explicates nothing in particular.
<br>
<br>
In a purely-causal universe, we are as much "machine" as any robot, unable to "intend" or generate "meaning", despite having developed a "sense of intention".  There is no escape from such a conclusion, (without appeal to "magic".)

<br>
Are they or are they not different ? Is there no difference between an obervervable feature of a piece of matter and the piece of matter itself ?
<br>
I don't make an 'assertion' that matter is distinct from the observable fetures of matter : it's a fact. It is not up for discussion.Likewise there is no argument with the fact that syntactical objects have no causal powers - it's a fact.  
<br>
If not explain otherwise. Explain how the number 2 has causal power.
<br>
"machine-consciousness" is impossible "
<br>
More unfounded nonsense. If the machine has been designed with materials that have the causal powers of conscionsess, then the machine will have consciousness. If the machine has been designed purely as a "function server" defined totallly in terms of what it delivers to the user ( and having no intrinsic/specific causal content  of its own ) like all contemporary 'robots', then no, it will not have consciousness.
<br>
<br>
"we are as much "machine" as any robot, "
<br>
Correct. Meat machines.Consciousness machines.
<br>
<br>
"unable to "intend" or generate "meaning", "
<br>
You didn't intend to write this  mail about the subject of consciousness ?

". There is no escape from such a conclusion, (without appeal to "magic".) "
<br>
<br>
Absolute cataclysmic drivel , archetypal AI tactic to pretend that any disagreement with its view is based upon superstition. As I've said before, I'm nor religious but at least a God, were, he/she/it to exist , would have causal powers. The number 2 could not, by any strectch of the imagination, have causal powers yet set such assertions are at the heart of AI hocus pocus.

=============
<br>
Since you admit you don't know I'll tell you exactly why. There is no way evolution, that is random mutation and natural selection, could tell the difference between intelligent conscious behavior and intelligent non conscious behavior so if the two were not linked, if they were really in 'different realms', then there is absolutely no way evolution could ever have ever produced it.

No no no no. You are assuming that

b) Consequently that , de facto, the OPINION of the third party is relevant to the issue of wether or not the r the human is conscious. It is not.

<br>
<br>
There is no way that 'evolution' the process would ever look at anything and describe is as 'intelligent' as 'intelligence' is a human value judgment and a SUBJECTIVE fact. Consciousness is an OBJECTIVE fact like a brick or a human being or a mountain or a large vat of water. It is part of the world that does not need human observers in order to see exist.

From Evolution's point of view 'intelligent' means good decision maker and problem solver. From Evolution's point of view 'good' means passing your genes onto the next generation. From Evolution's point of view consciousness is irrelevant, the fact that it nevertheless exists means it can only be a inevitable byproduct of intelligence.

&gt; "Randomness does not necessarily imply acausality"
<br>
<br>
True.  But acausality would imply statistical ramdomness of some sort.
<br>
<br>
I can think of perhaps three forms of randomness.
<br>
<br>
1.  Conformance to "random-like statistics".  All forms of (apparent) randomness would need to pass test such as these, things like distributions of run-lengths, long-term convergence in certain properties such as mean variance, etc.
<br>
<br>
The digits of Pi, or most any irrational decimal expansion, tend to a good "(pseudo) random" sequence, even though produced by a relatively short algorithm (thus possessing only finite information, despite the never repeating.)
<br>
<br>
2.  Strongly Random sequences.  In theory, such a sequence cannor be expressed or generated by any finite algorithm.  They are "non-computable", and informationally incompressible.  Such a sequence's "shortest encoding" is itself.
<br>
<br>
No algorithm can generate such a sequence, unless it already has the sequence "in its back pocket", and is merely reiterating the values.  But that would make the algorithm itself infinite in length.
<br>
<br>
The decimal expansion of "almost all" real numbers  are strongly random (since there are only a countable infinity of finite algorithms, yet an uncountable infinity of real numbers.)  Unfortunately, we have no way to know when we are "in possession" of a strongly random sequence, at least by inspection.
<br>
<br>
3.  Acausal "generation" (really, "observation", since it is probably an abuse of the term "generate" to "acausally generate".)
<br>
<br>
I had suggested that if a mix of C-14 and C-12, were gradually replaced with a flow of C-14, sufficient to counter-balance the decay-rate of C-14 in the mixture, then a count of "decays-per-unit-time" might serve as the source of a strongly-random sequence, by virtue of acausality.
<br>
<br>
Curiously, if one imagines the universe to be "playing out" a huge random "generation", one can almost associate three camps of "believers" according to which form of randomness the universe is exhibiting.
<br>
<br>
The "Order Sufficiently Complex Leads To Apparent Chaos" folks might subscribe to type-1.  Some "small seed" is sufficient.
<br>
<br>
The "Weak-QM" folk (hidden variables, et al) might subscribe to type-2.  The seed is infinitly long and undiscernable, "but it exists already".
<br>
<br>
The "Strong-QM" folk would subscribe to type-3.

I find myself increasingly in "camp-3", fundamentally.
<br>
<br>
Of course there is definitely something to camp-1, at least in explaining how the "averages of aggregations" and the consequent rise of causality lead to some "forms" being (more or less) universal.
<br>
<br>
The "laws" of physics, while perhaps incapable of telling us when an atom will decay, may lead to precisely why the "rates and proportions" manifest.  These "values" interrelate to make certain "patterns" effectively attractors.  On the "very small" they are very strong attractors, hence the ubiquity of protons, etc.
<br>
<br>
I guess I see "physics" (the theories) serving to explain how "type-1-fundamentals" lead to "type-3-stable manifestations".
<br>
<br>
In these terms, I see "type-2" as being a short-cut that is a "cut too short".
<br>
<br>
I am reminded of something Einstein said, with respect to formulating the laws of physics, (paraphrasing):
<br>
<br>
"They should be made as simple as possible, and no simpler."

Actually, we don't know enough to say one way or the other.  It depends on how you interpret the equations.  Heisenberg can be interpreted in several different ways.

<br>
The two cases (weather and Shakespeare) aren't similar at all.
<br>
<br>
   While I think John overstated the case when he implied that we completely understand the weather, no one doubts that the weather on the earth is deterministic at the classical level, even if chaotic.  Weather is a physical process.
<br>
   On the other hand, the relationship between the alphabet and Shakespeare's writing is different.  First, the alphabet that Shakespeare used and the one that we use is subtly different.  And the English language has changed dramatically since the 16th Century. So, perhaps it is not true that you completely understand the writing that Shakespeare used to encode his meaning.  But more importantly, aesthetics is not a science (at least yet, thank goodness.)  The question of what Shakespeare meant is not a scientific one. Even if Shakespeare were still alive and we could ask him, he might not even realize every thing that he meant.  To borrow an idea from postmodern philosophy, when I read Shakespeare, it "means" something different from what it "means" when you read it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"We have known the genetic code for 40 years and now we have the complete genome, in effect we have the human blueprints and we know the language it is written in, thus we know all there is to know about human biology."
<br>
<br>
Here at least we are dealing with two scientific questions.  But again, you are comparing apples and oranges.  No, we don't know "everything there is to know about human biology."  But John did not claim that we know "everything there is to know about the weather" either.  He said we understand the mechanism by which the weather works.  We do not yet know as much about human genetics as we do about the weather, but we learn more every day.  When I received my PhD in anthropology back in the dark ages, we did not understand how to use mitochondrial DNA to trace kinship relations.  Now we do.  More importantly, even though we don't know how every gene works (for example, we don't know why half my beard went white before the other), we do have very useful knowledge (which gene combination contributes to cystic fibrosis, for example.)  And I would say that within a few years, we will have as good a working knowledge of the genome as we do of the weather.
<br>
<br>
Finally, I'd like to say that there are no "final answers" in science.  I doubt that we will ever know everything there is to know, even if we do emerge into the glorious posthuman future that we talk about in these forums.  But one doesn't have to have perfect knowledge to understand how something works.  Otherwise, we would never understand anything.

Nope, the problem is not that there are too few consciousness theories but too many. Consciousness theories (but not intelligence theories!) are a dime a dozen, the reason they are so cheap it that there are no objective facts they need to explain so even if by blind luck you did stumble onto the correct theory there is no way to ever know it is the correct theory. That being the case we must make do with second best, if something acts conscious then it probably is. Like most things in life there is no guarantee we won't make a mistake but it's the best we can do.

I think you'll find there aren't any. There may be some dippy half-assed drawing board pseudoscientific nonsense masquerading as a theory, but as they're hogwash that doesn't comply with the set of standards normally known as 'science' I'm afraid they don't count.

You need to read some work on episetemology, as claarly you don't know any. Not all hypotheses have equal value and that means that some psuedoscientific garbage about 'algorithms' leading some kine of 'complexity to consciousness does not constitute a useful working hypothesis as it is circular and untestab;we.. I could argue there is a giant worm at the centre of jupiter or that pluot is made of green cheese but it doesn't meany anything unless it produces a logical consequence we can test via aexperiment. When you say 'they are a dime a dozen' and fail to give any examples what you really mean is you don't know any. And there is a good reason for that  - there aren't any.

I could not agree with you more. If you asked me to come up with a theory to explain intelligence I would be at a loss, you would be able find an experiment that would blow a hole in any theory I came up with in no time. Intelligence is hard. Consciousness on the other hand is easy, even my theory about feet causing consciousness, stupid as it may be, is not contradicted by any objective fact. A good consciousness theory needs to do more than just 'explain consciousness' because that just means 'tell me a story about consciousness'. Stories are cheap and most of them are fiction, experiments are neither. I can not imagine any experiment that could tell the difference between a good consciousness theory and a bad consciousness theory.  If you know of such an experiment please don't be shy, tell the world!

<br>
Well you could impress me by at least stumping up with a half-hearted coherent argument.
<br>
<br>
"I could not agree with you more. If you asked me to come up with a theory to explain intelligence I would be at a loss"
<br>
That is simple. Intelligence is a qualitative feature of brains with no formal properties and largely dependedn upon the opinion and largesse of the observer Consciousness is a phenomenon with formal properities that exists whether an observer is there to view it or  not. Yet again, you are mixing ontologies willy nilly.
<br>
<br>
"I would be at a loss, you would be able find an experiment that would blow a hole in any theory I came up with in no time. "
<br>
Yes. My brain supports cosnciousness and its not a size 11 foot. Next.
<br>
<br>
"Consciousness on the other hand is easy, even my theory about feet causing consciousness, stupid as it may be, is not contradicted by any objective fact. "
<br>
<br>
It is stupid as it suggests that people without feet can't be conscious. I don't even need to consider it. Your theory is a useful one in that it does produce objectively measurable conclusions which can lead to us quite quicly concluding that it is false.
<br>
<br>
"A good consciousness theory needs to do more than just 'explain consciousness' because that just means 'tell me a story about consciousness'."
<br>
<br>
Yet again a misunderstanding of science. Science needs to give an account of consciousness, that is all : the circumstances surrounding its production and all causal factors. It doesn't need to explain what consciousness, for want of a better word , 'is'. No more than physics tells you what matter 'is'. Physics merely gives an account of the formal propwrties  of matter.
<br>
<br>
" I can not imagine any experiment that could tell the difference between a good consciousness theory and a bad consciousness theory."
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I don't think this is formal grounds for disproof. A bad consciousness theory would be one that was circular and provided no grounds for falsification via experiment. Most AI theories fall into this category.  A good one would make a positive statement about matter and the physical world that would enable it to be DISPROVED via experirment. Positive verification of the already existing body of known facts is generally considered to be insuffiecient grounds for accpetance.

Exactly, and as I said it is not contradicted by any objective fact I know of, it so happens that I have feet. Stupid yes, but no more stupid than any other consciousness theory.

And how do you objectively measure the consciousness of people without feet, or people with feet for that matter? There are an infinite number of consciousness theories, all different, that can never be disproved by experiment. It follows that there will never be a consciousness theory that is worth a bucket of warm spit. Lacking a theory I must use a rule of thumb, if it acts intelligently then it is probably conscious, even if it is made of silicon and not meat.

<br>
In the absence of a more detailed theory of consciosness you can only do so with a simple test based upon good assumptions. Currently that would involve something like an assumption that the brain causes consciousness .  A marked change in electrical / activity and a loss of consciousness in the patient ( who would no longer be able to communicate and whose eyes would now be shut ) following the removal of feet would be experimental grounds for further typical grounds for hypothesis/investigation. This is no different to any other scientific theory. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
"There are an infinite number of consciousness theories, all different, that can never be disproved by experiment. "
<br>
There are NONE. You are confusing , CONSTANTLY, the subjective nature of mental pheonomena with their third party existence. There is no test for 'matter' either : only its formal properties within theoretical frameworks. That does not mean to say that matter cannot be examined within an objective framework.</p></td>

<br>
===========
<br>
People have thought most of their fellow human beings (those who were not  sleeping or dead that is) were conscious for as long as there have been human beings. During almost all of that time they knew nothing about the brain, the Greeks thought it was just an organ to cool the blood and the heart was the seat of the soul.  They nevertheless thought other people were conscious because they acted that way, and we do the same thing today. All I ask is when judging the consciousness or lack thereof of a computer you play by the same rules.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Standard AI though trap. You DON'T accept people's behaviour as "proof of consciousness". In one sense you are falling yet again into confusion between objective criteria for proof and the subjective experience of mental life. 
<br>
<br>
What you describe is the one, psychological , subjective experience of one person seeing another. You DON'T think people are conscious 'just because they act like you'. First of all if you see something 'acting like you' what you think is 'this is another human'. Your brain moves into a state of expectations and function based upon the idea that there is another human being around. Up to now its instinct. Abstract notions like consciousness don't even come into it.
<br>
<br>
It may be the case after some quiet reflection in the presence of another human being it may cross your mind to think that he is conscious. But if you do it is only because you bave made a SUBSEQUENT, intellectual step -  namely , that 'humans are like me' , tnerefore 'they have the attributes of consciousness like me' leads you to the belief/conclusion that another human being has consciousness BECAUSE you have it, and you BELIEVE that human beings are basically the same.
<br>
<br>
But the important point is that your statement 'we think is a human is conscious because of behaviour' is an objective reflection ABOUT human behaviour - not an obective reflection on the nature of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
That consciousness exists is a statement we either believe or not. That is exists objectively in all humans is a sound belief upon which to base scientific investigation. That it is subjective in nature does not disqualify it from objective investigation.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"do you think people who are sleeping are conscious, or those under anesthesia or those who are dead and if not why not? "
<br>
You really haven't read the mail have you ?
<br>
If you think that people are conscious because of the way they are behaving, that is NOT an objective statement about consciousness. It is an objective statement about how most people have simple working theories ( as part of their normal working psychology ) about the RELATIONSHIP between consciousness and behaviour.
<br>
Am I making myself clear now ? You don't use people's behaviour as proof, per se, of the notion of the existence of consciousness per se ( in the way that you seem to be suggesting )  : rather you connect certain behaviours with consciousness STATE. This is a theory based upon a combination of personal experience and an instinctive belief that all humans are similar.
<br>
What you are describing is not how to produce an objective test of consciousness : you are describing how human psychology uses simple theories of consciousness state on a daily basis - but this theory is PREMISSED on two ideas : a)that consciousness is an objective fact  and b) all humans are quite similar. 
<br>
So I do judge/guess/ people's consciousness state by looking at them - because like most people I use the theory. But the catch is my theory only applies to other humans and ( to a lesser extent ) animals.
<br>
The other thing to point out that I am aware from a third party point of view that my theory is stricly limited. I could be fooled into thinking that I've seen a human when I haven't. For instance , a robot . In which case I am aware that the primitive test I apply to consciousness conditions based upon behaviour is fundamentally flawed,as I can't always tell wether something is a human being or not. From the small set of external and easily reproducible criteria ( behaviours, appareance , noise ) I cannot conclude that the appropriate INTERNAL criteria for something being a human being has been met. In short, a painting of a duck is not the same thing AS a duck.
<br>
<br>
I don't think people under anaesthesia are conscious. 
<br>
That is because anaesthetists have working theories of consciousness based upon a combination of third party  metrics : heart rate, anaesthetic level,oxygen level and ( in some circumstances ) brain scans monitoring various alpha activity in the brain. Anaesthetists came to the conclusion a long time ago that consciousness wasn't best assessed via a visual assessment ofthe patient.This is an observable and of use : but of its own is not a good guide to consciousness level.
<br>
The question of wether people who are sleeping are conscious is more complicated. People who are asleep may be dreaming, and this indicates a level of consciousness. They may be dozing and in and out of consciousness and semi-consciousness. So I wouldn't come to any conclusions about the conscious state of sleeping people by looking at them. That is why scientists have a preference for monitoring alpha activity in the brain when studying sleeping people, as its a good guide to changes in mental state.
<br>
What you see in both these cases is science in action : scientists using theories of consciousness based upon non-sensory criteria as the usual human psychology version is woefully inadequate.
<br>
But in case you haven't still got the point I reiterate : when you say "you think people are concious because of their behaviour" what you are commenting about is human bevaiour . You are not making an objective statement about consciousness. You cannot therefore conclude that if you see human behaviour in robots you can assume they are conscious.

A keen grasp of the obvious.  I didn't say it's an objective fact about consciousness because there are none, I said it's a useful rule of thumb. Actually it would be useful even if it were untrue because I would be unable to function if I thought I was the only conscious being in the universe.

Baloney. Most people don't know anything about anesthesia theory but still don't have the slightest trouble telling if somebody has passed out. And the idea that a squiggle on a EEG graph paper is more important in determining consciousness than intelligent behavior is absolutely ridiculous.

You did actually. You maintained it was useful as an objective test of consciousness in non-humans.
<br>
<br>
"I do judge/guess/ men's consciousness state by looking at them - because like most men I use the theory. But the catch is my theory only applies to other men and ( to a lesser extent ) women. "
<br>
Because women are human and have brains too.
<br>
<br>
"Most people don't know anything about anesthesia theory but still don't have the slightest trouble telling if somebody has passed out."
<br>
<br>
Sure. But there are levels of "passing out" : levels of consciousness. What you have stated is exactly what I said before, namely that most humans operate a primitive theory of consciousness state. But that theory is of no use to anaesthetists who need more detail than 'on' or 'off'. They need to know that somebody is sufficiently 'on' not to be dead and sufficiently 'off' not to wake up during an operation. So they need other apparatus and theory. They need more information, and that involves additional theory about consciousness and additional data.Its not sophisticated but it IS more better than visual evidence alone.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"And the idea that a squiggle on a EEG graph paper is more important in determining consciousness than intelligent behavior is absolutely ridiculous. "
<br>
What the hell has intelligent behaviour got to do with it ? Where did that come from ? Are you suggesting anaesthetists ask their patients a few questions about share prices to see if they're conscious ? 
<br>
<br>
Consciousness is a natural phenomena : it exists regardless of the existence of observers. If I were the last man in the universe I would still be conscious. Intelligent behaviour is a value judgement of one human being of another. It enables one human being to guage the mental capacities of another. It has nothing to do, in the sense you describe it, as being a 'test of consciousness' - the consciousness of the other human is already assumed. It is a test of capabilities of one human by another. 
<br>
<br>
You are confusing the existence of simple theories of consciousness in everyday use by human beings as prima facae evidence that the test for consciousness is synonymous with the test for human behaviour. Nonsense.

Yes that is exactly, precisely, what I am saying; and I can not find the slightest particle of 'nonsense' in it. As for being confused let's review a bit. You have said the awesome profundities exposed in the 2 slit experiment are no more interesting than a pop up book, you have said something can be random but still be caused by something, you have said the old cause and effect assumption is as strong today as it was in the days before the Quantum Mechanics revolution, and although you don't say why you even insist that the famous quote from Steven Hawking ' The quantum effects of black holes suggests that not only does God play dice, He sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen' in no way contradicts your view. Given all that it would seem to me you are in no position to call anyone 'confused'.

No I didn't. Classical causality may be dead, but causality per se is not. Read what I said . What I stated, repeatedly, was that quantum mechanics and the 2-slit experiment does not mean the end of cause and effect. And it doesn't.

<br>
<br>
Need I say more than repeat it again ? A test for human behaviour is a test for human behaviour. Not a test for consciousness. We can only extend the test for consciousness to the test for human behaviour, if, and only if, the object we are studying is a human being. We cannot conclude that a non-human has consciousness just because it acts like a human, as our everyday theory rests on the requirement that the object of our theory is, actually, a human being, and not just a mimic.

It is in short, nonsense to think that a duck is the same thing as a painting of a duck.

<br>
=======
<br>
<br>
Ok, I well.When a photon of undetermined polarization hits a polarizing filter there is a 50% chance it will make it through. For many years physicists who disliked the idea that God played dice with the universe figured there must be a hidden variable inside the photon that told it what to do. By "hidden variable" they meant something different about that particular photon that we just don't know about. They meant something equivalent to a lookup table inside the photon that for one reason or another we are unable to access but the photon can when it wants to know if it should go through a filter or be stopped by one. We now understand that is impossible. In 1964 (but not published until 1967) John Bell showed that correlations that work by hidden variables must be less than or equal to a certain value, this is called Bell's inequality. In experiment it was found that some correlations are actually greater than that value. Quantum Mechanics can explain this, classical physics or even classical logic can not.
<br>
<br>
Even if Quantum Mechanics is someday proven to be untrue Bell's argument is still valid, in fact his original paper had no Quantum Mechanics in it; his point was that any successful theory about the world must explain why his inequality is violated. I will attempt to show how to find the inequality, show why it is perfectly logical, and demonstrate that nature refuses to be sensible and just doesn't work the way you'd think it should.            
<br>
<br>
I have a black box, it has a red light and a blue light on it, it also has a rotary switch with 6 connections at the 12,2,4,6,8 and 10 o'clock positions. The red and blue light blink in a manner that passes all known tests for being completely random, this is true regardless of what position the rotary switch is in. Such a box could be made and still be completely deterministic by just pre-computing 6 different random sequences and recording them as a lookup table in the box. Now the box would know which light to flash.
<br>
<br>
I have another black box. When both boxes have the same setting on their rotary switch they both produce the same random sequence of light flashes. This would also be easy to reproduce in a classical physics world, just record the same 6 random sequences in both boxes. 
<br>
<br>
The set of boxes has another property, if the switches are set to opposite positions, 12 and 6 o'clock for example, there is a total negative correlation, when one flashes red the other box flashes blue and when one box flashes blue the other flashes red. This just makes it all the easier to make the boxes because now you only need to pre-calculate 3 random sequences, then just change every 1 to 0 and every 0 to 1 to get the other 3 sequences and record all 6 in both boxes.
<br>
<br>
The boxes have one more feature that makes things very interesting, if the rotary switch on a box is one notch different from the setting on the other box then the sequence of light flashes will on average be different 1 time in 4. How on Earth could I make the boxes behave like that? Well, I could change on average one entry in 4 of the 12 o'clock lookup table (hidden variable) sequence and make that the 2 o'clock table. Then change 1 in 4 of the 2 o'clock and make that the 4 o'clock, and change 1 in 4 of the 4 o'clock and make that the 6 o'clock. So now the light flashes on the box set at 2 o'clock is different from the box set at 12 o'clock on average by 1 flash in 4. The box set at 4 o'clock differs from the one set at 12 by 2 flashes in 4, and the one set at 6 differs from the one set at 12 by 3 flashes in 4.
<br>
<br>
But I said before that that boxes at opposite settings should have a 100% anti-correlation, the flashes on the box set at 12 o'clock should differ from the box set 6 o'clock by 4 flashes in 4 NOT 3 flashes in 4. Thus if the boxes work by hidden variables then when one is set to 12 o'clock and the other to 2 there MUST be a 2/3 correlation, at 4 a 1/3 correlation, and of course at 6 no correlation at all. 
<br>
A correlation greater that 2/3, such as 3/4, for adjacent settings produces paradoxes, at least it would if you expected everything to work mechanistically because of  some hidden variable involved. 
<br>
<br>
Does this mean it's impossible to make two boxes that have those specifications? Nope, but it does mean hidden variables can not be involved and that means something very weird is going on. Actually it would be quite easy to make a couple of boxes that behave like that, it's just not easy to understand how that could be. 
<br>
<br>
Photons behave in just this spooky manner, so to make the boxes all you need it 4 things:
<br>
<br>
1)A glorified light bulb, something that will make two photons of unspecified but identical polarization moving in opposite directions so you can send one to each box. An excited calcium atom would do the trick, or you could turn a green photon into two identical lower energy red photons with a crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate.
<br>
<br>
2)A light detector sensitive enough to observe just one photon. Incidentally the human eye is not quite good enough to do that but frog's can, for frogs when light gets very weak it must stop getting dimmer and appear to flash. 
<br>
<br>
3)A polarizing filter, we've had these for a century or more.
<br>
<br>
4)Some gears and pulleys so that each time the rotary switch is advanced one position the filter is advanced by 30 degrees. This is because it's been known for many years that the amount of light polarized at 0 degrees that will make it through a polarizing filter set at X degrees is [COS (x)]^2; and if x = 30 DEGREES then the value is .75 If light is made photons that translates to the probability any individual photon will make it through the filter is 75%.
<br>
<br>
The bottom line of all this is that there can not be something special about a specific photon, some internal difference, some hidden variable that determines if it makes it through a filter or not. Thus the universe is either non-deterministic or non-local, that is, everything influences everything else and does so without regard for time or space. One thing is certain, whatever the truth is it's weird.

<br>
However , this does not constitute a disproof of causality. It constitutes a critique of one possible classically based solution to quantum mechanics, namely the idea of 'hidden variables' based upon classicists ( in the physics sense )  refusal to believe that measurement per se is an effective contributor to a quantum systems' state . 
<br>
<br>
Even assuming that hidden variable theory may be plausible, its STILL doesn't constitute a defeat of cause and effect. If I have and electron wave moving in an electrical field then the electron wave is distorted by it. Cause and effect. A nuclear disintegrates not 'because it feels like it' or that 'the random hand of causality wanders in and does what it likes' but becuase the intranuclear forces create Potential Energy states that favour disintergration.  Nothing in this proof , which is essentially a critique of a quesionable idea , changes that. </p></td>

Hey Bozo, plagiarism is a serious charge! This is not the first time I've debated matters of this sort with people online, I wrote this critique of the Bell Inequality on June 03, 2000 and sent it to the Extropian list on that day, check the archives if you don't believe me. And before you accuse somebody of being a thief it would be wise to do a bit of checking, it's not hard to do nowadays, just take a sentence from it and do a Google search. I assume you've heard of Google. I have nothing more to say to a man who unjustly and publicly called me a thief except to say you have proven moral integrity can not be used to distinguish man from machine.

<br>
May I suggest the acquisition of a dictionary. The very fact that we are talking about consciousness makes it an objective fact, and the fact we have been talking about its states means that we have objive facts ABOUT the objective fact of consciiusness. What you mean to say , I think, is that the nature of consciousness is private and subjective as are all mental experiences. As usual you are confusing in , may I say , a classically way typical on these pages, the nature and structure of consciousness with its actual objective existence.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"How do we know there is no understanding? "
<br>
<br>
I think searle's Chinese room points out one thing : that digital computers can never have a sense of what they are actually doing. 
<br>
Think about it - I'll assume you're familiar with computers.
<br>
<br>
All a computer consists of is commands that say "take the contents of register a, do something with it , possibly with the contents of another register b, and then stick it somewhere in memory or disk".
<br>
<br>
It repeats these operations time and time again : it can have no aggregate understanding of what it is meant to be. In fact , as most programmers know, you can't even work that out from the source code - you need to ask the programmer.
<br>
<br>
So let's look at an emotion like fear. Fear is pure semantic : what it is like to be scared can only be described in terms of itself. There may be objective features you could point to ( increase in heart rate, sweat, palpitation etc. ) but the subjective , first party sense of terror is not communicable in anything other than words referring to terror. 
<br>
<br>
Subjective fear is semantic : it consists of nothing else.
<br>
<br>
Now let's look at a ( vey simple ) implementation of 'fear'
<br>
<br>
void fear ()
<br>
{
<br>
	printf("J'ai peur");
<br>
}
<br>
<br>
Now this is an implementation for the French market. The computer of course will see the characters as digits and will merely move digits from one place to the other. It wouldn't have a clue that it was actually meant to be feeling quite scared. A non-french speaking programmer similarly would not be able to discern what the source was meant to do. 
<br>
<br>
The only way , in fact , to find out what the meaning of the program is, is to find the human being who wrote the program , and who produced the arbitrary implementation of his own 'fear' in the first place, and ask him what its meant to be.
<br>
<br>
It is impossible, therefore, to discern MEANING from Turing representations, from computer programs. The whole point about the man in the Chinese Room is that he actually doesn't have the slightest idea what the function of the Chinese Room is meant to be , as only the inventor of the Room would be aware of that.
<br>
<br>
At this point we hear from AI crowd, the typical refrain "it doesn't matter what happens internally, from the outside it appears to be doing the job properly". But this assumes that the existence of mental states is CONDITIONAL upon the existence of observers. 
<br>
<br>
That I am conscious if, and only if, other people are there to see it. Either that or I have "another" observing person in my own head.In which case where the hell did he come from ? Is he a computer program too then ?
<br>
<br>
The other thing to point out is that computers themselves are arbitrarily implemented. Most digital compoters use varriable voltage levels, but it could be anything. So a computer is basically a block of silicon with arbitrarily varying voltage : only the designer ( observer ) actually has the ability to see what bits of the silicon block are doing the computing in the first place. So the computer doesn't know its a computer in any case. Its existence is actually in the designers' mathematical world, not the physical one. It wouldn't know where it begins or ends, as its existence is observer relative. So it wouldn't even know it was executing these arbitrary instructions in the first place - the Chinese Room is actually too generous to AI, as it doesn't acknowledge that syntax is not intrinsic to nature but to thinking.

You wrote:
<br>
<br>
&gt; "Is there no difference between an obervervable feature of a piece of matter and the piece of matter itself ?
<br>
I don't make an 'assertion' that matter is distinct from the observable fetures of matter : it's a fact. It is not up for discussion.  Likewise there is no argument with the fact that syntactical objects have no causal powers - it's a fact."
<br>
<br>
I repeatedly "assert" that same "fact", as my "paper and crayons" Turing machine is intended to clarify.
<br>
<br>
&gt; "If the machine has been designed with materials that have the causal powers of consciousness, then the machine will have consciousness. If the machine has been designed purely as a "function server" defined totally in terms of what it delivers to the user ( and having no intrinsic/specific causal content of its own ) like all contemporary 'robots', then no, it will not have consciousness."
<br>
<br>
You effectively rule out consciousness by the qualifier "having no intrinsic/specific causal content of its own", to make the latter statement tautological.
<br>
<br>
And I assume that you mean "materials whose interactions" support consciousness, and not that DNA, lipids, or proteins themselves (no less carbon, oxygen, protons or neutrons) automatically bestow causal powers of consciousness, independent of "arrangement".
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; (A purely deterministic universe would imply that we humans are) "unable to "intend" or generate "meaning", "
<br>
<br>
&gt; You didn't intend to write this mail about the subject of consciousness ?
<br>
<br>
I "feel that I intend", but would not a purely deterministic universe imply that my "intention to write" is no different than a tree's "intention to fall over"?  Just could not be helped.  I could not "choose to write" nor "intend", except delusionally do.
<br>
<br>
&gt; "All a computer consists of is commands that say "take the contents of register a, do something with it , possibly with the contents of another register b, and then stick it somewhere in memory or disk".
<br>
<br>
Why not reduce it further?  "All a computer does is open and close electrostatic gates in response to electrical potentials consequent to previous flows of electrons through gates."  That description purposely blurs the distinction between transistor-electric-behavior and (gross) neural-electric behavior, and forces us to ask "what else is significantly different" (there ARE still significant differences).  The fact that the initial "settings" for such a system (computer) are (usually) the intention of a programmer, and thus can be interpreted to represent "syntactic manipulation", does not make the underlying physics "less physical".
<br>
<br>
Granted, I don't believe that the "physics of a digital processor" are sufficient to support consciousness "as I feel consciousness", but the reason must be more subtle.  We are arguing "physics" in each case, not comparing the "physical brain" to a syntactic abstraction.
<br>
<br>
I see that there remain two significant "differences".
<br>
<br>
1.  There is "more going on" to neurons than a mere analogy to transistors can represent (greater variety of physical effects, not simply "signal cascades".)
<br>
<br>
2.  The "algorithmic processor", even down to the level of "gate-charge-transfer", is fully explicable and (in principle) fully determined (as long as the "system" never interacts with the "unpredictable outside world" and thus incorporates "changes" whose consequences were not forseen in advance by the programmer.)
<br>
<br>
I find the (1) more compelling as an argument to "machine consciousness is difficult", especially "computer-wise", but (2) may play a role as well.  If the "brain" were ever "mechanically understood" so well, that its behaviors could be interpreted as "syntactic manipulation", its ability to support consciousness may require internal "state" be disturbed by "unpredictable outside influence", at least at some point in its development.

<br>
I wasn't being clear. What I should have emphasised is that you don't care about HOW your robot is implemented physically, and so that any causal powers sufficient to create consciousness in the machine would be coincidental and not a result of your design, as your design was concerned solely with delivery of funtion to you as user/observer.
<br>
<br>
"And I assume that you mean "materials whose interactions" support consciousness, and not that DNA, lipids, or proteins themselves (no less carbon, oxygen, protons or neutrons) automatically bestow causal powers of consciousness, independent of "arrangement". 
<br>
<br>
Correct.
<br>
<br>
"I "feel that I intend", "
<br>
That's all you need as proof. Really.
<br>
<br>
"but would not a purely deterministic universe imply that my "intention to write" is no different than a tree's "intention to fall over"?"
<br>
<br>
You have to differentiate between intentionality in acts of thinking and determinism per se. Intentionality is a component of thinking that is directed toward something in the outside world - it is a feature of psychology. Your intention to write is also a thought act. That you DID intend to write something ( ie had the psychological processes assocated with inending ) and then did so doesn't affect / impede/ have anything to with , in any way, the issue of whether it was pre-determined or not. Its possible to go through a process of intentional mental thinking in a determinstic world. Its that old chestnut - different ontologies. Determinism is about objective facts in the world of physics. Intentionality is an objective fact about the subjective workings of the brain.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 "does not make the underlying physics "less physical". "
<br>
<br>
There are no physics to computers. They are not physical objects. They can be implemented arbitrarily - water and sluice gates work more slowly but just as reliably as electronics. Physically comparing the brain to a computer serves no purpose due to this exact point. They exist in the syntax world of the user.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"1. There is "more going on" to neurons than a mere analogy to transistors can represent (greater variety of physical effects, not simply "signal cascades".) "
<br>
Yes - they are matter. Somehow they generate consciousness. But they are not ( and this is very important ) defined by their extrinsic content ( their metrics ) as they ARE matter, after all. They are defined by what they ARE. This is a difference which AI people just don't seem to get. Reproducing the movement and arrangement of a certain set of neural metrics ( the "signal" patterns , for instance ) can't be used a basis for reproducing the mental effect assocaited with them. It CAN be used as a basis for investigation . But the signal patterns and external metrics of neural activity do not CAUSE consciousness. They are assocaited with it. The metrics ( signal patterns etc.) are syntactical, and have no causal powers. Its a bit like modelling a nuclear reaction. We can model and simulate a nuclear reaction on a computer, but we do not have the causal powers available in the form of semantical  ( and not completely understood ) matter of uranium.

The Chinese Room has no point because it assumes the very thing it is trying to prove. The man is the only thing that could understand, the man does not understand, thus there is no understanding anywhere. From that he claims to have proven the man is the only thing that can understand. Idiotic.

In many cases the only way to know what the program will do is run it on a computer and see, the human programmer who wrote it will have no better idea of what it will do than your average caveman.

When talking about meaning and purpose you have to ask "purpose for who?". What is the purpose of a violin? To the manufacturer the purpose is to get a paycheck. To a drowning man its purpose is to act as a life-preserver. To a musician its purpose is to make music and to his tone deaf child its purpose is to be used to be used as a club to swat a bug. To a rock the violin has no purpose at all. To the computer the purpose of the program may be to keep running forever or maybe it will be to stop after a time, the only way to know is ask the computer and see what it does.

It is not. What he was trying to state is that symbol processors have no capacity to elucidate meaning, which they don't. They can't possible know from their symbols what they're 'meant' to be.

What rubbish. If I intend to run a program simulating a rainstorm, the meaninmg of the program is a rainstorm. And rainstorms are objective.

"When talking about meaning and purpose you have to ask "..way to know is ask the computer and see

<br>
Instead of trying to windbag your way out/around/up/down, why the hell don't you acknowledge the problem like verybody else does ? A program can't tell what it's meant to be . So how do you program a 'human brain' and expect your computer to know that its meant to be a brain ( with an internal conscious state ) and not a word processor ?

Yea yea, we've all heard you say that before, many times in fact, but even a astronomical number of repetitions does not constitute a proof. The way to figure out if someone or something understands something is to ask questions on the topic and judge the wisdom of the response.

You may have writing the program just because you thought it would be fun to simulate a rainstorm but why should I care why you did it, I don't even like you. For me the meaning may be to predict the weather or make money selling the program it or to hear the pleasant sound of rain falling.

I must confess to a sniggering admiration for infantility of this sort in what would profess to be serius debate. However maybe you would like ask how would you know , if I was meant to be simulating a rainstorm, and had no graphical interface ( I know you are the sort of person who would need pictures )  only producing a series of numbers, how you would know that the program was meant to be a rainstorm ?

Well..... he didn't exactly ask the man , face to face , if he understood. He wasked us all, in a kind of general sense, if what he was doing constituted the same thing as an understanding. The guy was basically translating Chinese without understanding Chinese, you must concede that. Or if not that guy , then put myself, who doesn't understand Chinese, I guarantee, in his place.
<br>
   You see, the whole point is SOMEBODY has to understand Chinese in order to create the Chinese Room. Somebody has to 'understand' what Chinese words mean what English words in order to produce the translation lexicon used by the Chinese Room. Otherwise how do you tie the two things together ? At somepoint , if I am on about , say a human, I need to know what a human IS without reference to any kind of symbol - I need to know "what a human is" and have a sense of that semantic in order to be able to translate it into Chinese. This is what the man in the Chinese Room is not doing - he's just using a lookup table in the manner of a standard computer program.

I concede that Chinese was being translated and I concede that the man did not know Chinese, but I do not concede that Chinese was not understood. The man was just one small part of the system, like a single neuron in a brain. The way to investigate the system is to write in Chinese 'Do you understand Chinese?' and submit the question to the room. I'll bet the answer will be 'yes', an answer of 'no' would be a bit of a paradox.

How do you know? Let's say you have developed a marvelous new conscious theory, how do you know it is correct? The only way to test it is by observing behavior. Your theory may predict that my current brain state should produce a feeling of sadness, you may even see tears in my eyes, but the only way to know if I have the subjective experience you expect, or any subjective experience at all for that matter is to ask me, take note of the sounds produced by my mouth, and hope I'm telling the truth.

I think you are getting ontology confused with epistemology.  
<br>
<br>
Consciousness is a fact.  I am conscious at this moment.  While you are reading this, you are conscious.  Consciousness exists.
<br>
<br>
However, I cannot prove that you are conscious.  I cannot *know* that any other entity, whether human, sentient animal, or computer is conscious.  I can only infer it from behavior.    But that does not mean that consciousness does not exist.   If you've ever spent any time with any of the higher non-human primates, you will know what I'm talking about here.  You look in their eyes, and you sense intuitively that there's somebody home, so to speak.  But there is absolutely no way for me to prove that they are, in fact, conscious beings, absent telepathy, which, alas, seems to not exist.

<br>
<br>
The "fact" you speak of is still a subjective one.  As you follow, you "infer" (albeit very reasonably) its existence in your reader, as I (your reader) infer its existence in you the writer.
<br>
<br>
Do we agree that the "human sensation of consciousness" is at least a manifestation of the physical world (the body in particular) and not some ethereal, or even physical "substance independent of the body"?
<br>
<br>
If so, then the issue of telepathy becomes quite problematic, even if, for the sake of argument, we imagine it could exist.
<br>
<br>
Suppose I employ some god-like genie to grant my wishes.  Rather than ask the genie "please tell me whether that entity actually is, or is not, experiencing what I would recognize as a conscious waking state", I ask the genie, "Please allow me to experience the mind of that entity (if indeed it has a mind) for one minute.
<br>
<br>
The genie grants my wish.  If the entity is you, I experience you.  If it is Ramona, or a typical AI of the day, perhaps I experience nothing (I am unconscious), or if there were a "sufficiently complex AI-like-thing", I experience something very weird.  Then the minute is up.
<br>
<br>
I turn to the genie and say, "Hey, I thought you said you would grant my wish!"  The genie replies, "I did.  Did you expect to retain some memory of that experience?"
<br>
<br>
I say, "Sure, why not?", The genie replies, "That would only be possible if you retain some sense of being YOU, while also experiencing that other entity.  But that is NOT what the entity you wished to investigate experiences, and that is what you asked for.  It simply experiences itself.  If you retain some sense of yourself while experiencing the other, you cannot know whether the difference represents part of what the other entity experiences, or merely your interpretation of the disturbance created by the mixing." The experiences of the other entity remain where they are entertained, naturally, with that entity.  Its in the physics of that entity."
<br>
<br>
I say, "Could you not bestow upon me some hybrid memory, alter my chemisry, whatever, to allow me now to have the memory of what that was like?  The genie replies, "Just how would I do that?" I cannot know what you, or that other entity experiences without losing myself in the process.  I would have no standard for accuracy, and I might create any one of a thousand possible hybrid memories.  You could infer nothing in particular from that.
<br>
<br>
My point in this hypothetical genie-powered telepathy exercise is to point out that, if we could create a technology to "read other human minds", it would probably operate because of some correlated artifacts of the physics/biology.  I suppose it is possible, but it may not resolve the "new-machine-consciousness" issue at all.
<br>
<br>
You might use the device to accurately discover my thoughts, the "hidden number I am thinking of", and not that of the "artificial".  That says nothing about whether the artificial entertains a consciousness, since that "sensation" may be modulated by a different media for which we have no proper correlates.  The idea that it could would suggest that "conscious mind" is some sort of uber-fluid that gains an existence of its own, independent of the physics of the substrate.
<br>
<br>
You might find "an aura" or a "wave manifestation" or something similar, and holding that to be somehow (correlated to) "the presence of consciousness", but that would not tell you whether the other entity "experiences" by that manifestation, even though you might extract the "right hidden number".
<br>
<br>
I think that the subject of "consciousness" is where epistemology and ontology become indistinguishable (and quite dark.)
<br>
<br>

     I *believe* consciousness to be an epiphenomenon of the brain.  Occam's razor seems to require it.  Sometimes when I think about Bell's Theorem, I consider other possibilities, but that's a can of worms I don't particulraly want to pry open.  
<br>
     The really hard question is why does consciousness exist at all?

I too believe consciousness is an epiphenomenon of the brain.  It is "generated" by the underlying physics.  To use the candle flame as an analogy, I do not believe that by extinguishing the candle flame, the former epiphenomenal "glow" goes floating through the ether in search of a new home in which to manifest.  The "glow" has no existence except as an artifact of the chemical transitions.
<br>
<br>
QM-indeterminacy exists as well in the candle flame as everywhere else, but leads to no observable "special effect".  The structure (or lack of structure) in the flame body is incapable of amplifying "tunneling" (for instance) to effect any phenomena of substantial difference.  (It may play a role the very moment an oily-rag bursts spontaneously into combustion, but thereafter it is all effectively causal.)
<br>
<br>
But in physical systems that are highly structured, wherein certain small events can be coherently amplified, QM effects may play a larger role.  This is still "brain".  Certainly, "epiphenomena of brain" does not mean "of brain chemistry in complete isolation to QM-physics."
<br>
<br>
&gt; "The really hard question is why does consciousness exist at all?"
<br>
<br>
The "Why" question is the real can of worms.  If you ask "what is consciousness" or "how does it get generated", we have a chance of finding an answer.  But "why" suggests (perhaps) purposefulness which may or may not exist.
<br>
<br>
We might ask "why protons and neutrons".  We can perhaps show how they are a consequence of the fundamental forces, but this just pushes the question back to "why does the universe manifest that particular division of forces".
<br>
<br>
The "fact" that we (and most mammals likely) manifest degrees of consciousness is evidence that it serves to enhance "persistence".  It is more useful having it than not.  (By "useful", I intend purposeless tendency to persist in the environment.  One might argue the individual persists so to perpetuate the species, but again, the species persists to what purpose?  Purpose is in the eye of the beholder.)
<br>
<br>
However the forces that make the H2O molecule a "favorable pattern" originated, they did not do so (I believe) in order to manifest the variety of beautiful snowflakes that occur.  Yet those beautiful and intricate snowflake patterns are, in an extended sense, patterns embedded in the relationships that exist among the natural forces.
<br>
<br>
(I don't know if that is a particular answer to "why consciousness", but that its very existence implies it to be a favorable manifestation.)
<br>
<br>
ASIDE:  Some may argue that the feature of "consistency at a distance" which QM indicates may make consciousness some sort of "universal", which we merely interpret as "individuals" due to the circumstance of the physical locality of our "instruments".  My eyeballs are usually in the same room as my hands, so to speak, so the "connectedness" is not glaringly apparent.  There may be something to this viewpoint.

No it isn't ! Its an objective fact for, instance , that consciousness is subjective in nature. Consciousness as natural phenonmena is an OBJECTIVE fact. The retort that there is no proof of consciousness is not a response to this , as in this domain, or ontologiocal domain, we are referring to conscoousness as the IDEA which we both understand to have some meaning.</p></td>

Similarly a test for consciousness would be based upon a hypothesis about what causes caonsciousness. IN objective scientific terns if out theory of consciousness' cause seems to hold out , is backed by experiment , then we can apply the same validity to an objective consciiousness test as ANY OTHER scientifc test , fronm the size of atoms to the size of the universe to the age of the earth - all facts scientifc in nature and based upon bedrocks of experomentation and hypothesis.</p></td>

<br>
&gt; "One other thing, if behavior can not indicate consciousness then why on earth did evolution produce it?"
<br>
<br>
I would not say behavior can not "indicate" consciousness, it is just not a "proof" that the entity experiences the awareness as we do.
<br>
<br>
I may well be that evolution, taking the "bottom-up" path of chemistry to forge reactive systems, emotional systems, and finally our analytical capabilities, "found" that the artifact of subjective awareness (as we know it) to be valuable, or to be a natural adjunct to the manner in which the processing occurs.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, we can take Boolean-logic-based mechanics, and create stuff that BEGINS with the analytic activity.  Today's computers can do many complex analytic jobs better than a human, and we don't think they are conscious.  Thus, it is at least possible that we could create ever-more-clever analytic-based constructs without (necessarily) engendering the "sense of sentience" we possess.  That might depend upon how we implement the processes in a physical manifestation.  There may be thousands of possible analytic/sensory-processing physical-basis architectures (what I call "substrates").  Transistors in silicon is just one of these.  Perhaps all of them can be capable of supporting "analysis", and only 10% capable of supporting "minds of subjective conscious sensation".
<br>
<br>
Total conjecture, of course.  Real proofs or counter proofs are encouraged.  So are good arguments.
