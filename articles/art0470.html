<p> The monumental accomplishment of decoding the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is 
              nearly complete. The results of work of the official <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>-sponsored 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a> together with the efforts of private firms

              The Rosetta Stone of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, is presently undergoing intense 
              scrutiny by scientists in nearly every country in the world. The 
              potential benefits of these efforts for improving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> health and 
              well-being are incalculable. </p>
<p> "The greatest payoff from understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              is likely to be an illumination of the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>esis of 
              disorders that are currently poorly understood and for which treatments 
              are &#8230;frequently sub-optimal&#8230;.<a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> offers &#8230; the 
              greatest opportunity for development of targeted therapy since the 
              development of <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s,"<sup>1</sup> according to Frank 
              S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. of the National <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">Genome</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Institute, 
              National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p> Historically, previous medical disciplines have dealt largely 
              with the <i>after-effects </i>of an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>'s genetic inheritance. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> and these other new disciplines, on the other hand, look 
              directly at the genes themselves. They look at an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>'s genetically 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med biochemical pathways of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> under conditions of health 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. For the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> ever, physicians have the tools 
              to help their patients employ truly <i>preventive <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a></i>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> may help scientists find ways of modifying <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> biochemistry 
              long before a genetically predisposed <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> has a chance to appear.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p> Rifling through the dusty pages of medical <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, however, it 
              seems axiomatic that our powers for diagnosing <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s has preceded 
              our ability to offer effective treatment for them. This also seems 
              true on the new <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> frontier as well. </p>
<h2>Testing for genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s</h2>
<p>Enter predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a>, the identification of the genetic predisposition 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s to certain <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s, which is the diagnostic arm 
              of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. This field has already advanced 
              to the point that a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of sophisticated diagnostic tests are 
              currently available to help predict one's predisposition towards 
              many serious (although preventable or modifiable) genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. 
            </p>
<p>The fact that proteomics and other therapeutic modalities are still 
              in their infancy is in keeping with the historical diagnostics-first-therapeutics-later 
              tradition. <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> in the sister specialties of proteomics, <a class="thought" href="entries/bioinformatics_entry.html">bioinformatics</a>, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> should eventually provide ever more effective 
              therapeutic modalities for patients with these genetic predispositions 
              in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Roger Williams, M.D. in the 1950's, introduced the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of biochemical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ity: that every <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> possesses a specific and unique 
              biochemical blueprint.<sup>3</sup> Until a few years ago, however, 
              discovering what constitutes our biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ity has been 
              hit-and-miss at best, the empiric result of decades of careful trial 
              and error. </p>
<p>For example, after many years of observation, one person may have 
              noticed that he has more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> when eating <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> for breakfast, 
              that eating strawberries gives him a rash, and that he gets a headache 
              if he consumes artificial sweeteners. Yet, another person feels 
              sluggish if he has too much <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> for breakfast, but seems to 
              have no problems with strawberries or artificial sweeteners. Truly, 
              "One man's meat is another man's poison," for we are all 
              biochemically unique.</p>
<p>As a direct result of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a>, however, 
              we have begun to obtain much more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> regarding our biochemical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ity in a rapid, quantifiable and affordable fashion. The 
              tools of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> can now accomplish in minutes what once 
              took years of trial and error. One company, Orchid Diagnostics, 
              currently offers products and services to help physicians and laboratories 
              perform HLA genotyping (to assist with matching of donor transplant 
              organs with recipients), <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> susceptibility testing and immunogenetics. 
              Each of their <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is capable of performing over 500,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a> 
              analyses per day.<sup>4</sup> </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> testing may soon be able to predict precisely what foods 
              are best for us, prescribe <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ized exercise and other lifestyle 
              prescriptions, and recommend a personalized list of supplements, 
              neutraceuticals, and prescription drugs for maximum health and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> 
              avoidance. This will all be based on an examination of our personal 
              genetic makeup. </p>
<p>One often hears of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> being compared to a game of cards. An <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              born with a serious genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> such as Cystic Fibrosis or Huntington's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of having been dealt a "bad hand." 
              Conversely, the 105-year old we read about who <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s her longevity 
              to "Eating a jelly donut for breakfast and smoking two packs 
              of cigarettes every day" would clearly seem to have started 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> with exceptionally good cards.</p>
<p>The Mendelian <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of "genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a>" - that 
              the genes with which we are born will determine our <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> in an absolute 
              fashion - has given way to a newer <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> of "genomic relativism." 
              Genes don't <i>determine</i> what <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s we will acquire, they 
              merely <i>predispose</i> us to them. The implications of this simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of healthcare and preventive <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> are 
              far-reaching. </p>
<p>While there are a few genes that do condemn an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> to an 
              almost certain <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> (such as the Cystic Fibrosis or Huntington's 
              Chorea genes mentioned above), these constitute only a tiny fraction 
              of the 35,000 or so genes that comprise the entirety of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. The overwhelming majority of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, our genes merely 
              <i>predispose</i> us to <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> conditions that will either manifest 
              or not later in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> depending on the lifestyle choices we made 
              earlier on. We end up reaping later in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> what we ourselves sowed 
              in our youth.</p>
<p>Continuing with our <a class="thought" href="entries/gaming_entry.html">gaming</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, the cards we are dealt represent 
              our genetic heritage. We call this sum total of our genetic makeup, 
              the totality of our inherited <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, our "genotype." </p>
<p>Our genetic heritage (our starting hand) expresses itself throughout 
              the course of our lifetimes as a consequence of the environment 
              in which we live and the lifestyle choices that we make (how well 
              we play). Like any good card game, it is this combination of luck 
              (genetic makeup) plus skill (lifestyle choices and environmental 
              factors) that makes for an exciting outcome. This <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <i>genomic 
              relativism</i> is at once enabling and terrifying. The age-old of 
              battle of predestination vs. <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a> is being fought on the front 
              lines of our nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. And it is now looking like very little 
              about our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> health is absolutely predestined or predetermined.</p>
<p>Doctors now realize that almost all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s result from 
              the<i> interaction</i> of genetic susceptibility with <i>modifiable</i> 
              environmental factors. In the overwhelming majority of cases, genetic 
              variations do not cause <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>; rather, they influence a person's 
              susceptibility to <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> as a result of lifestyle choices and environmental 
              factors. It's not "nature" vs. "nurture," but 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> (genetic heritage) <i>and</i> nurture (lifestyle/ environment).</p>
<p>Compared with looking at one's "genotype," it's more 
              compelling to watch how the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> is translated, i.e., the 
              "phenotype" of one's genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, particularly 
              the subtle differences between <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s. More than 99% of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> is identical among all people. Yet, it is this fraction of one 
              percent that is different that creates all the variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and 
              ensures that no two humans (other than identical twins who have 
              precisely the same <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>) will be exactly alike.</p>
<p>This fraction of a percent difference in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from person to person 
              is of critical <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance. In the course of replicating itself billions 
              and trillions of times, as it must do to create all the cells and 
              tissues of the body, our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> undergoes numerous opportunities for 
              errors. These mistakes or imperfections in our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> most commonly 
              take the form of what are called <i>point mutations</i>, <i>deletions</i> 
              or <i>translocations</i>. These variations are collectively known 
              as "polymorphisms" (literally, multiple shapes). Our biochemical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ity derives largely from these polymorphisms, 100,000 
              or so of which have been found to date.</p>
<p>Specific genetic polymorphisms that involve only a single <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> subunit -- cytosine, thymine, adenine, or guanine) are the 
              most common variant, and such "single <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> polymorphisms" 
              (SNPs, pronounced "snips") are extremely common in the 
              population at large. It is estimated that 50% of people have at 
              least one of the known SNPs. </p>
<p>By convention, rare single-<a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> imperfections in the genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> are referred to as mutations. When a specific mutation is so 
              common that it affects more than 1% of the population, it is called 
              a polymorphism or SNP. These polymorphisms are <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant because 
              they can change the manner in which the body functions, and, in 
              some cases, predispose us (or make us more resistant) to specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s.</p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">Individual</a>ized healthcare</h2>
<p>It is axiomatic of the new theory of genomic relativism that just 
              because we have a genetic variation that predisposes us to a certain 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, say heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, rheumatoid arthritis 
              or osteoporosis, it does not mean that we are predestined to get 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> some day. The fundamental equation of predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> 
              is:</p>
<p><b>Genetic predisposition + environment + modifiable lifestyle 
              choices = phenotypic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a></b></p>
<p>Predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing signals the beginning of truly <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ized 
              healthcare. Physicians can now begin to evaluate each patient's 
              unique genetic predispositions and then develop and <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> a 
              carefully targeted, customized plan for intervention years before 
              pre-<a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> imbalances or <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> symptoms begin to appear.</p>
<p>Almost all of the most common disabling and deadly degenerative 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, including cardiovascular <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>,

              to be the result of interaction between genetic and environmental 
              factors.</p>
<p>By evaluating possible genetic variants in a patient, we will be 
              able to:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Identify "hidden" gene mutations that may promote 
                  chronic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a></li>
<li>Gain earlier advanced warning of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> susceptibility in 
                  each patient</li>
<li>Determine cumulative risk associated with specific, easily

<li>Identify key target areas on which to focus follow-up</li>
<li>Monitor therapeutic effectiveness of intervention strategies 
                  with laboratory testing"<sup>5</sup> </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>With clinical insight such as this, physicians will gain a deeper 
              understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> processes and be able to develop more rapid 
              and efficacious interventions.</p>
<p>Predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> attempts to identify the most significant single 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> polymorphisms (SNPs) in <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s. This is done to 
              predict the likelihood that an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> is predisposed to develop 
              a particular chronic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> or functional imbalance and evaluate 
              the risk that this <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> or imbalance might appear under circumstances 
              of particular environmental or lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>Predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> may make medical practice in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              radically different from the <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> of today. Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s 
              will no longer be forced to play the poker game of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> blindfolded, 
              neither will their doctors. Rather than having to guess what lifestyle 
              choices to make, <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s may finally get to look at the owner's 
              manual for their particular bodies. Instead of relying on randomized 
              studies involving large patient populations, doctors will have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> 
              to sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic tools <i><a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ized</i> 
              for each of their patients.</p>
<p>We may find such <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> enabling, but terrifying as well. The 
              scary part will be that <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s will be required to take ever-greater 
              personal responsibility for maintaining their own health and longevity. 
              The more powerful and dangerous the genetic idiosyncrasies with 
              which an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> is born, the greater the responsibility on that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> to modify their environment, diet and lifestyle to attenuate 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of that potentially harmful genetic material. As 
              a result, physicians will move laterally into positions as co-workers 
              or counselors with their patients, rather than as paternalistic 
              "medicine men" or even "healers" who possess 
              and dispense wondrous "cures."</p>
<p>The same SNP that can be harmful to an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> in one environment 
              can be beneficial to that same <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> under different circumstances. 
              For example, a SNP that has historically afforded <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s a 
              better chance of survival during periods of famine or near starvation 
              may render those persons significantly more prone to obesity under 
              conditions of excess or even adequate <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a>s. The nearly ubiquitous 
              incidence of obesity among modern day Pima Indians is testimony 
              to the variegated <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of the same genetic mutation under 
              different environmental circumstances.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The power of predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> to alter medical practice and 
              allow physicians to practice true preventive <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> seems awesome. 
              However, despite the signs in the road warning of "Wonders 
              Ahead," I predict that only a small percentage of patients 
              who might be helped by predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing will take advantage 
              of its availability within the next few years. </p>
<p>The inherent conservatism of the medical community as well as the 
              intrinsic reluctance of the population at large to accept dramatic 
              changes in their worldview will force a delay in popular <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation 
              of this <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>. Most physicians and patients will be likely 
              to continue wandering in the barren but familiar landscape of the 
              prehistoric genetic desert for a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of years before arriving 
              at The Promised Land of Predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a>.</p>
<p>The groups most likely to avail themselves more quickly of the 
              new diagnostic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> emanating from Predictive <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> testing 
              will include:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Proactive patients who seek not merely good health, but optimal 
                  health and want to bring their risks to an absolute minimum.
                <li>
<p>Patients who have a family <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of potentially serious <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s 
                  that are easily tested with current technologies, such as heart 
                  <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, Alzheimer's, colon <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, osteoporosis, etc.<br>
<li>Patients who have proven refractory to conventional treatments.
                <p></p>
</li></p></li></li></ol>
<p></p>
<p>I predict that this radical shift in medical diagnostics will take 
              several years to filter throughout the medical community and enter 
              common usage among the general populace. For widespread acceptance 
              to occur, physicians and patients alike will be forced to take giant 
              strides in their <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ualizations of why we get sick. The very 
              idea that patients can be tested <i>before the fact</i> for the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s to which they are predisposed represents a very big first 
              step. </p>
<p>Taking it to the next level and realizing that patients themselves 
              are largely responsible for their own fates may take an even greater 
              stretch of the <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. It will definitely represent a major 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> for patients and physicians alike. Such 
              a drastic alteration in our <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of health and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>--that 
              we are each largely responsible for our destiny--will make many 
              folks very uncomfortable indeed.</p>
<h2>Testing panels</h2>
<p>At this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (mid-2002), several <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing panels are <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly 
              available. Each of these panels tests for a dozen or so SNPs at 
              a cost of a few hundred dollars per panel. Within a few years, thanks 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>,<sup>7</sup> for the same few 
              hundreds of dollars, panels will be available that test for <i>thousands</i> 
              of genetic predispositions. </p>
<p>We will also soon have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to "DNA chips" that will 
              test for most, if not all, of the 100,000 or so SNPs currently identified.<sup>8</sup>
<sup>9</sup> One company, Affymetrix, is currently making gene chips 
              available to doctors for analyzing our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and tracking gene <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> 
              in tumors and other tissue they are sufficiently optimistic about 
              their prospects that their toll-free <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> is (800) <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">CHIP</a>. Affymetrix 
              and other companies have developed <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>-coated glass wafers that 
              can be subdivided into over 150,000 distinct locations, so we will 
              be able to detect polymorphisms on tens of thousands of genes in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of minutes.</p>
<p>The road to these "DNA chips" may have a few hurdles 
              to cross first, at least before this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is available at 
              low cost. It seems that a few years ago, the overwhelming majority 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> found in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> didn't seem to bear any relationship 
              to the genes themselves and came to be known as "junk <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>." 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers have since learned that these "non-coding" 
              regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> are not "junk" at all, but contain 
              vital <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Many SNPs, in fact, are found in these non-coding 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> segments.<sup>10</sup> </p>
<p>A small Australian biotech company called Genetic Technologies 
              of Melbourne was among the first to realize that SNPs found outside 
              of the genes themselves may be just as <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant as genetic polymorphisms 
              themselves and registered a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s in the 1990's relating 
              to this discovery. Genetic Technologies currently seems dedicated 
              to cashing in on these <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s and has threatened to sue companies 
              who try to use this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> without first paying large royalties.<sup>11</sup>
</p>
<p>Without discussing the legality or morality of such <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s, 
              genomic testing could easily end up be much more costly as a result 
              of these and similar <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s and lawsuits. With our current <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              and abilities, however, even if the massive amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that 
              could be found on <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> chips were available, it would likely produce 
              little beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> overload. We need to wait for the <a class="thought" href="entries/bioinformatics_entry.html">bioinformatics</a> 
              scientists to catch up. </p>
<p>At the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, because of both the cost considerations and 
              our limited abilities to make meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, today's 
              clinicians need to apply limiting criteria to determine which polymorphisms 
              it makes most <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to screen. In so doing, we can establish which 
              SNPs should be included as part of a comprehensive preventive health 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that incorporates predictive genomic testing. Presently, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s seem quite manageable.</p>
<p>Of the 100,000 SNPs currently identified, only 8,000 seem <i>relevant</i> 
              to health. These 8,000 polymorphisms are relevant because they exert 
              a significant effect on our biochemistry and <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a>. Frankly, 
              we don't know what the other 92,000 do &#8230; at least not yet.</p>
<p>Given our current <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, only polymorphisms 
              that exist in a significant percentage of the population are likely 
              to be identified and evaluated in a cost-effective manner. Polymorphisms 
              of sufficient <i>prevalence</i> among the population at large slice 
              the pool down to about 300 SNPs.</p>
<p>It seems both prudent and ethical to test primarily for polymorphisms 
              whose effects are modifiable through the use of currently available 
              interventions. Finding out that a patient has a genetic defect that 
              cannot be modified by any presently available therapy may create 
              as much anxiety as good (although patients should have the right 
              to know if they wish). About 100 SNPs are currently <i>modifiable</i> 
              through interventions such as diet, lifestyle, nutritional supplements, 
              and prescription <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, the effects of our interventions should 
              be easily <i>measurable</i> through presently available functional 
              laboratory testing. In the year 2002, this brings the total of <i>relevant</i>, 
              <i>prevalent</i>, <i>modifiable</i> and <i>measurable</i> genetic 
              polymorphisms down to the easily manageable <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of a few dozen 
              or so.</p>
<h2>Genomic test panels</h2>
<p>The more common of these single <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> polymorphisms have been 
              assembled into genomic test panels. Currently, four predictive genomic 
              panels are <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly available for physician use:<sup>12</sup> 
              a cardiac risk panel, an osteoporosis risk panel, an immune function 
              panel and a detoxification panel.</p>
<p><i><b>The Cardiovascular Risk Panel</b></i> identifies genetic 
              single <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> polymorphisms associated with increased risk of 
              developing coronary artery <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, other vascular <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s, Alzheimer's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a>, and hypertension. Risk factors measured include markers 
              for inflammation, folic acid defects, iron storage problems, blood 
              coagulation abnormalities, and cholesterol regulation defects, as 
              well as cardio-protective markers. The <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from such profiling 
              will provide the ability to predict heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> decades before 
              symptoms appear.<sup>13</sup> </p>
<p><i><b>The Osteoporosis Risk Panel</b></i> identifies SNPs associated 
              with increased risk of developing bone loss. Risk factors include 
              defects in calcium and vitamin D metabolism, parathyroid hormone 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, abnormal collagen <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, and chronic inflammation.</p>
<p><i><b>The Immune Panel</b></i> identifies SNPs associated with 
              increased risk of developing immune dysfunction. Risk factors include 
              altered production and activity of cytokines such as interleukins 
              and Tissue Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) that may lead to inflammation 
              and altered immunity. These SNPs have been associated with increased 
              risk of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, some types of <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>s and 
              other <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. </p>
<p><i><b>The Detoxification Panel</b></i> identifies SNPs associated 
              with increased risk of developing detoxification defects, especially 
              with increased exposure to environmental and other toxins. Risk 
              factors include altered liver detoxification processes, including 
              defects in glutathione conjugation (the detoxifier <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> mentioned 
              in the sidebar below). Defects in the body's detoxification pathways 
              have been associated with increased risk for certain <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>s, chronic 
              fatigue, multiple chemical sensitivity, and alcoholism.</p>
<p>Some patients may feel it worthwhile to screen with all four panels, 
              while others may prefer to pick and choose one or more of the panels 
              they feel are most relevant to them.</p>
<p>The testing procedure itself is very simple. Cells are collected 
              either by using a mouth rinse solution collected at the patient's 
              home or from a simple blood draw in the physician's office.<br>
<br>
              Many patients are understandably concerned about the confidentiality 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing results. Manufacturers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> 
              test panels have made the sage decision to address these issues 
              before problems occur and have concluded that <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> test results 
              require a higher level of security and confidentiality than other 
              test results. At the testing facility, <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing results 
              are protected by a security <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> that is disclosed only to the patient's 
              attending physician.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>It would be tragic for <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> test results to be used by agencies 
              such as insurance companies and HMOs to discriminate unfairly against 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s who have been proactive in seeking to achieve better 
              health. So in most medical offices, copies of <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> test results 
              are not included with the patient's regular medical records, but 
              are kept in a separate secure location. This is done to ensure that 
              such <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is not routinely available to insurance companies 
              who do not yet have sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing 
              to understand the full implications of these results. </p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>Just as I was preparing to finish this article (in fact, I had 
              only these concluding paragraphs to complete), I got the results 
              of my own <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> profile back from the lab. As is often the case 
              where hopes and dreams in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> collide with <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, the outcome 
              of my tests was less ideal than I had hoped, but not as bad as I 
              had feared. I found out that I am among the 30% of the population 
              who carries the Apo E4 gene. While I haven't lost sleep over this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, I have found these results disturbing. This <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              has introduced a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> chop onto the calm waters of my inner tranquility. 
            </p>
<p>Luckily, though, I have the more common and less risky E3/E4 <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>, 
              not the distinctly more malevolent E4/E4. Yet, I now live with the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that my chances of developing <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Alzheimer\'s Disease')">Alzheimer's Disease</a> at some 
              point in my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> are 2-3 times average. From a purely statistical 
              point of view, the chance that a man my age with the E3/E4 <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a> 
              will develop AD within the next 30 years is 14%. </p>
<p>All things considered, I am still glad I took this test. I found 
              I had other genetic risk factors as well. Now knowing precisely 
              what some of these risks are has stimulated me to be even more vigilant 
              in my health maintenance efforts. To help reduce my chance of developing 
              <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Alzheimer\'s Disease')">Alzheimer's Disease</a> and some other <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s for which I find I am 
              at above average risk, I plan to reduce my consumption of saturated 
              fat significantly. I plan to eat more fish. I will also make some 
              modifications to the nutritional supplements I take. </p>
<p>But, knowing that all of the genetic risks that have been identified 
              for me are just that -- risks and not <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s -- gives me hope, 
              and also tools to keep some of these dreaded maladies at bay. So, 
              I am very glad that I took this test.</p>

<h2> <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> testing for cardiovascular conditions</h2>
<p>I want to offer one practical example of the type of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              available through <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> testing. We will examine one specific 
              marker that is part of the Cardiovascular <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a> Profile -- the 
              apolipoprotein E (Apo E) polymorphisms. We will first discuss the 
              specific risks and benefits associated with the different Apo E 
              polymorphisms. Then, we will discuss how this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can result 
              in lifestyle recommendations, which can help an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> modify 
              the phenotypic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of the more dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>s.</p>
<p>Apolipoproteins are carrier <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s responsible for the transport 
              of lipids such as fat and cholesterol throughout the bloodstream. 
              Since fat and cholesterol are oily substances that are not water-soluble, 
              they require specific carrier <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to help move them from place 
              to place in the body.</p>
<p>One <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant lipid carrier <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, Apolipoprotein E, comes in 
              three main polymorphic flavors -- Apo E2, Apo E3 and Apo E4. These 
              three lipoproteins differ in the amino acids found at locations 
              112 and 158. Apo E2 has the amino acid cysteine at each of these 
              loci, while Apo E4 substitutes arginine in each location. The most 
              common type, Apo E3, has one of each, cysteine at site 112 and arginine 
              at site 158.<sup>17</sup> These subtle differences produce significant 
              variations in how Apo E performs its duties of pick up and delivery 
              of lipid bundles. One isoform, Apo E2, performs its job of clearing 
              cholesterol from the arteries quite well, while Apo E4 is much less 
              efficient.</p>
<p>Every person possesses two copies of the Apo E gene, one inherited 
              from each parent. There are, thus, six possible combinations: E2/E2, 
              E3/E3, E4/E4, E2/E3, E2/E4 and E3/E4. </p>
<p>It is known that <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s who possess one or two copies of the 
              E4 polymorphism have an increased incidence of elevated cholesterol, 
              triglycerides and coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>.<sup>18</sup> Of even greater 
              clinical significance, however, is the correlation between the presence 
              of Apo E4 and the incidence of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Alzheimer\'s Disease')">Alzheimer's Disease</a> (AD). The effect 
              of this polymorphism on AD is actually quite dramatic. <br>
<br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">Individual</a>s who do not have any copies of the Apo E4 allele have 
              only a 9% risk of developing AD by age 85. People with one copy 
              of the gene (the E3/E4 <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a> carried by over 25% of the population) 
              have a 27% chance that they will develop AD by the same age. For 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s who possess two copies (E4/E4), the risk of developing 
              Alzheimer's increases to 55% by the age of 80.<sup>19</sup> </p>
<p>Furthermore, the age at which dementia is diagnosed is much younger, 
              depending on the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of copies of Apo E4 carried: 84 years old 
              if one has no copies of E4, 75 years if one copy and a mean age 
              of 68 years in E4/E4 homozygotes.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Pathological examination of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> tissue of Alzheimer's patients 
              reveals three main types of abnormalities: extracellular amyloid 
              plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and vascular amyloid 
              deposits. It is probably no coincidence that Apo E4 has been immunochemically 
              linked to each of these types of deposits.</p>
<p>The Apo E2 gene, on the other hand, appears to confer some degree 
              of protection against development of AD, and patients with at least 
              one copy of the E2 allele have a 40-50% <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in their Alzheimer's 
              risk.<sup>21</sup> Apo E2 is not perfect, however, as some forms 
              of heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> are more common in patients with this polymorphism. 
              All things considered, Apo E2 is a pretty good deal, however, and 
              it is not unlikely that our 105 year-old smoker mentioned above 
              was born with one or two copies of Apo E2. The Apo E3 form is the 
              most common, by far, (over 50% of the population is E3/E3) and affords 
              some protection against both heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>In a large study of 12,709 <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> twins who were 62-73 years old, 
              the odds of developing AD was 17.7 for <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a> E4/E4 versus E3/E3 
              (i.e., an almost 18-fold increased risk) and 13.8 for E4/E4 versus 
              all remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>s. By contrast, the odds ratio for heterozygous 
              E3/E4 was only 2.76 versus E3/E3 and 2.01 versus all other <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>s.<sup>22</sup>
</p>
<p>Although the Apo E4 allele is a potent risk factor for AD and may 
              be associated with other forms of dementia, the good news is that 
              most people who carry the Apo E4 gene still do not develop dementia, 
              and about one-half of people diagnosed with AD do not possess any 
              copies of the Apo E4 gene.<sup>23</sup> In some studies, it has 
              been reported that the proportion of patients with dementia that 
              is attributable to the Apo E4 allele is estimated to be only 20%.<sup>24</sup>
</p>
<p>Free radical damage appears to play a key role in the creation 
              of insoluble beta-amyloid, one of the hallmarks of AD pathophysiology. 
              Therefore, particularly for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s who discover they carry 
              the Apo E4 gene, special efforts to limit free radical damage seem 
              prudent.<sup>25</sup> Patients who have been identified as Apo E4 
              carriers would be advised to begin taking aggressive free radical 
              damage control measures, i.e., anti-oxidant and other therapies, 
              as early in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as possible. </p>
<p>The following practical recommendations are suggested for patients 
              carrying the Apo E4 <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a> (although they could also be of value 
              for anyone):</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vitamin and herbal agents</b> which directly interact with 
                  free radicals such as vitamin <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, vitamin E, alpha lipoic acid 
                  and coenzyme Q 10 should be taken daily.</li>
<li><b> Pharmacological agents</b> that may help reduce free radical 
                production in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> include the monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, 
                selegilene,<sup>26</sup> and the hormones, melatonin and estrogen 
                (women only). Low-dose aspirin therapy (81 mg daily) may be prudent 
                as well.<sup>27</sup> For patients unable to lower their lipid 
                levels despite dietary strategies, the nutrient policosanol is 
                of value. For patients who still require a prescription drug, 
                lorelco (available through compounding pharmacies) seems to work 
                better than other cholesterol lowering agents, although some specific 
                precautions must be followed when this medicationis used.</li>
<li><b>Neutraceutical agents</b> such as phosphatidylserine in fairly 
                large doses - such as 300 mg/day taken on a long-term basis - 
                has been shown to slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's dementias.<sup>28</sup> 
                Acetyl-l-carnitine seems to have value as well.</li>
<li><b>Lifestyle changes</b> including stress management and regular 
                aerobic exercise have been found to be of value in preventing 
                the incidence of AD. <sup>29,30</sup></li>
<li><b>Dietary modifications</b> are warranted since we recall 
                  that Apo E4 is also associated with elevated lipid levels. Suggestions 
                  include an aggressive low-fat diet to help keep cholesterol 
                  levels down, while lowering simple carbohydrates in the diet 
                  (such as sugars and refined flour products) is often of benefit 
                  to <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s with high triglycerides. </li>
