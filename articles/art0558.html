<div class="TeaserText">Concerns about the possible negative consequences of nanotech may stifle vital nanotech research that could otherwise result in medical and other important breakthroughs. Expert witnesses at a congressional hearing recommended wider public debate, greater resources to develop defensive technology, and funding of societal, ethical, and environmental impact studies along with technology forecasting and basic science studies.</div>

<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net April 14, 2003.</i></p>
<p>The convergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              could result in self-replicating, nanoscale robots with potentially 
              destructive consequences, according to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-scientist <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, 
              writing in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a> </i>magazine, and others. These concerns led 
              the U.S. House Committee on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> of the U.S. House of Representatives 
              to hold a hearing on April 9, 2003 to "examine the societal 
              implications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and H.R. 766, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> and Development Act of 2002." </p>
<p>The hearing was also motivated by Michael Crichton's <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>-fiction 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <i>Prey</i>, which "brought <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s concerns to a 
              wider public and reinvigorated the debate over the possible negative 
              consequences of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>," stated the hearing's charter. Committee 
              Chairman Rep. Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) kicked off the hearing by 
              warning that the debate about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> itself "could 
              turn into 'gray goo.'" </p>
<p>The committee invited four expert witnesses to recommend ways to 
              address these concerns: <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, Founder, Chairman and CEO 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_technologies_entry.html">Kurzweil Technologies</a>, Inc.; Dr. Vicki Colvin, Executive Director 
              of the Center for <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> and Environmental <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> and 
              Associate Professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a> at Rice University; Dr. Langdon 
              Winner, Professor of Political <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> in the Department of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/peterson_entry.html">Christine Peterson</a>, cofounder and President of <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a>.</p>

<i>Kurzweil, Colvin, Winner, Peterson: beyond gray goo</i></p>
<p>The real controversy, Kurzweil pointed out, is over "self-replication, 
              which is needed to scale up for molecular manufacturing in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. 
              We are already facing the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> gone awry 
              with with bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s," he pointed out. </p>
<p>Peterson agreed, warning that the fear of long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> is 
              "spilling over to the short term." Winner also noted that 
              European Union nations have refused to buy genetically modified 
              foods, reflecting a "failure to provide attention to broader 
              social, political and cultural <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>." </p>
<p>"European funding agencies take near-term possibilities seriously," 
              added Colvin. They are "ramping up significant funding in environmental 
              health impacts" and will be paying close attention to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p><img height="284" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041210043345im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/kurzweil&amp;Boehlert.jpg" width="400"><br>
<i>Kurzweil and Committee Chairman Boehlert discuss the <br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a></i></p>
<p>Some of the panel's key recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Kurzweil: "Put far greater resources to develop defensive 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>." For example, "we are on the threshold of 
                self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>," but <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is "slowed 
                down by the regulatory process." "Bioterrorists don't 
                have to follow those regulations. We're going to have to put explicit 
                resources. We're not going to be able to invent an antidote for 
                each new bio peril that comes along. We need some general broad 
                tools and to streamline the regulatory processes. A similar problem 
                could hamper <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, he warned. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
                that is "particularly dangerous should be regulated," 
                such as how to modify <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s. </li>
<li>Cole: Invest five percent of the total <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> dollars 
                in "societal, ethical, and environmental impact studies&#8230;to 
                ensure <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> develops responsibly and with strong public support. 
                We should "put money in broad public discussion instead of 
                social scientists." </li>
<li>Peterson: Conduct open international development to deal with 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a>, do <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forecasting, and fund a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> feasibility 
                review of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>'s long term (molecular manufacturing) by unbiased 
                physicists.</li>
<li>Winner: Don't place questions solely in the hands of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and business. "We need to include the public 
                early on" and create "small panels or ordinary disinterested 
                citizens to examine <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issues about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>."</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>A forum for nuts?</b></h2>
<p>But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) warned that such panels could 
              "give a forum to the very nuts that you are trying to overcome 
              in Europe." He also warned about "putting sociology and 
              literature majors in charge of defining the goals and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> majors. Injecting bureaucracy is the most effective 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of turning pure <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> into solid waste." </p>
<p>Agreeing with this position, Kurzweil summed up the consensus views 
              of the witnesses and the committee, recommending "substantial 
              forums and analysis, debate and dialogue and review of these issues 
              by interdisciplinary groups of people and funding to do that. Not 
              bureaucracy and regulation, but open dialogue and exploration to 
              really avoid some of the irrational and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al reactions that 
              have stymied GMO [genetically modified foods]." </p>
<h2><b>Funding <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a>s</b></h2>
<p>The discussion also turned to longer-range concerns. Winner warned 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in general are "plowing 
              onward to create a successor <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being. When word 
              gets out about this to the general public, they will be profoundly 
              distressed. And why should public money be spent to produce an eventual 
              race of <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a>s?" </p>
<p>"We already have people walking around who have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              in their brains," replied Kurzweil. For example, those who 
              have <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's disease</a> or hearing disabilities. "There are 
              already a dozen different <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s. We have artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a>s 
              and replacements of almost every body <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The ultimate implication 
              of these technologies will not be so much a successor <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, but 
              really an enhancement of our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. I would define the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> as that <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that inherently extends our own horizons. 
              We didn't stay on the ground, we didn't stay on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, and 
              we're not staying with the limitations of our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>."</p>
<p>"I hope you're free for lunch," added Rep. Boehlert.

  "The terrorists don't follow regulations." - YIKES! But then again, the terrorists don't have a National Science Foundation sugardaddy pumping $37 BILLION in PUBLIC money over the next 5 years for nano research.(And how's about those DARPA venture "capitalists"?)
<br>
<br>
  The free-market fairy did not create the Internet and the entire computer industry WOULD NOT EXIST without $7 TRILLION in PUBLIC investment. (Ever hear of the Cold War?)
<br>
<br>
  The "nuts" in Europe don't want CORPORATE BOSSES telling them what they can eat. Thus they hate Frankenfoods. Those kindly BANDITS at Archer Daniels Midland not only freaked up the food chain, they caused the FARM CRISIS. (There are 4 million fellow travelers of Tim McVeigh out there in the Corn Belt. They lost their farms, but they got LOTS and LOTS of guns.)
<br>
<br>
  Hey, gang, maybe in some PARALLEL UNIVERSE they'll make it to the "Singularity", but WE are going to TANK THE PLANET. Bush Jr.'s Assistant Surgeon General appeared on PBS saying BIOTECH weapons are going to bang humanity like a gong within 10 years. His advice - just keep shopping.
