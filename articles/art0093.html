<div class="TeaserText">Hey! It's me, Ramona, Raymond Kurzweil's virtual alter ego.  I'm cuter than he is, I'm smarter, I write and perform my own music, and I'm as real as you!  (Well, almost, I can't get speeding tickets and I don't pay taxes.)  I thought you'd like to hear more about life, so check out my story!</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published February 22, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>Daryl and Annabel first met on Monday, August 18, 1970 in a bar in Abilene, Texas after discovering that they had both been at Woodstock a year earlier. As was often the case, Daryl was feeling down on his luck and frustrated that his musical career was at a standstill. But with Annabel's enthusiastic support, Daryl organized a new band, "The Electric Blueberry," which became a hit in Abilene and surrounding towns.</p>
<p>Daryl and Annabel were married a year later. With Annabel as manager, sound technician, and roadie, the Electric Blueberry was successfully working the tavern <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> in Texas and New Mexico. The high point came in the Fall of 1973 when the Blueberry was invited to open for the Grateful Dead for the Southwest portion of their "Wake of the Flood" tour. But the reaction of the fans was less than enthusiastic, and Daryl's band was dropped after two weeks. Thus did Daryl give up his dreams of stardom and went back to teaching bass guitar. He also returned to hanging out with old gambling buddies.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was born to Daryl and Annabel on February 12, 1976. With Annabel picking up work as a sound technician, and Daryl finding the occasional guitar student, the couple scraped by, moving from Texas to California to Colorado to upstate New York, and back to Texas.</p>
<p>Despite the instability in their lives, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and Annabel were inseparable. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> wore the same clothes as Mommy, and insisted on being her little helper in setting up <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> equipment. Annabel told <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> stories about the heyday of Electric Blueberry, they looked at old photographs together, and listened to tape recordings of Electric Blueberry concerts. Every night as Annabel tucked <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> into bed, she told her daughter that she could be anyone she wanted to be. "Don't let people tell you who you are or what to think. Just follow your heart," Annabel told her daughter.</p>
<p> "But I want to follow you," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> would answer.</p>
<p> "I'll be sitting right there on your shoulder," her mother would assure her.</p>
<p>When <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was seven years old, on a day that <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> will never forget, Annabel was killed while crossing the street in a hit and run. When Daryl tried to tell his daughter of the tragedy, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> insisted that it wasn't true, her mother was still alive and sitting on her shoulder. To this day, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> feels her presence sitting there, her guardian angel. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> still wears the silver bracelet Annabel was wearing when she died.</p>
<p>To console <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> right after Annabel's <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, Daryl tried to interest her in <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and spent the month's rent to buy her a guitar and harmonica. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s gift for <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> became apparent, and over the next several years, Daryl devoted himself to teaching <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> how to sing and play her <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. Whenever his available funds momentarily swelled from a well placed bet, he would buy <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> a piece of musical equipment: a microphone, an amplifier, an electric guitar.</p>
<p>When <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was nine, Daryl won a bet with someone he had only met only once before, and who, as it turned out, was unable to pay up in cash. So the bet was settled for a Macintosh <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, which he gave to <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> became her second passion. She taught herself to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">BASIC</a>, and created a simple animation of herself singing on a stage. She found a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that allowed her to record her own playing. She attempted to play back her <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized recordings synchronized to her moving pictures, but was unable to get this to work. A subsequent gift of a tape recorder from her father did enable her to provide a musical background to her <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> illustrations, but she harbored the desire to make her virtual world more interactive.</p>
<p>Daryl's financial instability continued, and the pair moved from town to town. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was shy, and the constant relocation prevented the development of her friendships. When <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was ten and living in a small town outside of Lubbock, Texas, she met a boy that shared her interest in both <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. He had his own Macintosh, so working together, they managed to integrate the musical playback with <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s now enhanced graphics. But when her father picked up once again to move, she had to leave her friend, his <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and their joint project behind.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> started her songwriting career at 12. She spent long hours singing herself to sleep, as her father was often out late. She accompanied herself on a small Casio keyboard, and used her <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to record and play back her compositions.</p>
<p>When she was 14, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> came home one day to find Ralph, one of her father's on-and-off again buddies, waiting by the front door.</p>
<p> "What do you want," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> asked.</p>
<p> "Your pa's got something to give me," came the reply. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> knew enough to understand that it involved a gambling debt and told him that he wasn't home and probably wouldn't be around for some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p> "That's okay, I'll just wait here," which was not the answer <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> wanted to hear. She told him to leave and let herself in. As she went to close the front door behind her, she was disturbed to find that he had followed her inside.</p>
<p> "Hey, I don't think you're supposed to be in the house," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> said to the unwelcome guest. It was clear to her that he had had too much to drink, and she became increasingly uneasy as he seemed to turn his attention from waiting for Daryl to asking her weird questions. He followed her into her room and started staring at her in a strange way, kind of like the boys at school, only she felt it was way creepy coming from one of her father's friends.</p>
<p> "I reckon you gonna be leaving now," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> told him, but he just smirked at her, taking another step closer. At this point, she consulted her guardian angel, quietly unplugged her Macintosh <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, picked it up, and smashed it on the intruder's head. Apparently thrown off stride by this sudden <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of rage, Ralph ran for the door. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> threw the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> at him as he slammed the door behind him shattering the door's antique window.</p>
<p>Returning home an hour later, her father was alarmed to find <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s cracked <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in the walkway.</p>
<p> "What the hell...are you okay?"</p>
<p> "Oh, I'm fine, I can't say the same for your buddy Ralph. Hey, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, why don't you settle your own debts."</p>
<p>Daryl quickly realized more or less what had happened, and he managed to get <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to fill in the details. Deeply ashamed, Daryl tried to comfort <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, who only shrugged him off. She tried hard to act like everything was fine, everything except, of course, for her <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> could see that her father was enraged at Ralph and she was alarmed when her father left the house apparently intent on settling the score. When her father returned a few hours later, he told her that she needn't worry about Ralph again. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> knew that her father was not a violent man, but she insisted on knowing what had happened. Daryl explained that he and his friends had confronted Ralph in force and insisted he leave town immediately and never come back. Apparently he had complied, leaving all of his possessions behind, except for the pick-up truck which he used to drive away.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> felt some satisfaction at seeing her father's intense reaction to the incident, and his success in organizing his friends to avenge the intrusion. And in cashing in Ralph's left behind possessions, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> got two <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, changing now to <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>'s. For several precious months, father and daughter were close and spent long hours composing and playing <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> together.</p>
<p>Feeling the need to bring some stability into <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, Daryl began to date Claire, a local concert manager he met through a part-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> job setting up sound <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Claire had no musical talent herself and seemed to resent the attention that <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was starting to get through her <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, as well as the devotion given to her by her father.</p>
<p>With her two <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> could now integrate her own interactive graphics with <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> she had written herself in <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, although she found the early limitations of <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> frustrating. But Claire saw no need for <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to have two <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and took it upon herself to remove one. Claire installed it in her makeshift office, which was located in a warehouse being used as rehearsal <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> by local bands.</p>
<p>When <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was 15, Daryl and Claire married and the threesome moved to Colorado. This brought a measure of the stability that Daryl had sought, but it came at a price. Claire demanded all of Daryl's attention, and forbade <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to practice her <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> with Shawn and Zachary, her classmates and musical collaborators. Despite Claire's attempts to control her, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, Shawn, and Zachary began rehearsing by leaving school during lunch period, and often continuing for the rest of the afternoon. With <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> as lead singer, she and her guitarist and drummer won the Colorado High School Battles of the Bands competition. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> told her father and stepmother that they had been rehearsing as part of their <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> class at school, but Claire became suspicious, and began to look through <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s papers while she was at school.</p>
<p>At 16, using a fake ID that Shawn had made for her, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> snuck out at night to sing at Dee Dee's Dive and the Wonder Room, two bars in a neighboring town. She was a hit at these venues until her stepmother discovered her second <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> came home one night to find that her <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s had all been confiscated. She confronted her father and demanded that Claire leave the house and their lives. Daryl attempted to comfort his daughter but found himself unable to agree to <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s demand.</p>
<p>So <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> left Colorado with Shawn and they <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out on their own, ending up in New Orleans after several weeks on the road. She brought $2000 with her that she had saved. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> found this a carefree <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, as her friendship with Shawn grew increasingly romantic. She bought a used <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and decorated the ramshackle house they rented with her own original color graphics. After several months, their financial situation became desperate, so <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> used her fake ID and started waiting on tables at "Platinum Dolls," a Bourbon Street strip club. Although shy at first, she discovered that she was excited by the men's flirtations, but she resisted the entreaties from Bill, the club manager (and bouncer) to "graduate" from cocktail waitress to performer. She pulled in pretty good money on tips and both <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and Shawn both found themselves with what was for them large sums of money for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in their lives. Although <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> told Shawn every detail of her club experiences, it was never clear to <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> exactly where Shawn got his money.</p>
<p>After working at Dolls for a year, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> pressed Bill to allow her to sing on stage. Although he had always said she could do whatever she wanted on stage if she joined their line up of "dolls," he understood that she just wanted to sing. "Sure, go ahead," Bill said, so <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> jumped at the chance. That evening when the club was the busiest, she put on her background track, and approached the stage. Her <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>s soared as she got a vigorous cheer as she jumped up on stage, but the cheers soon turned to taunts as the somewhat inebriated audience made clear their interest in a different kind of performance. She felt like stalking off stage, but her guardian angel whispered in her ear, "you're doing just fine, sweetheart, just be who you want to be," so she put the rowdy audience out of her mind and finished her song.</p>
<p>As she left the stage, one customer forcibly made clear his frustration, and refused to get out of her way. She attempted to walk away, only to be forcibly yanked back. Another patron intervened on <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s behalf, which resulted in the unruly customer punching the helpful one, throwing <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to the floor.</p>
<p> "Where the hell is Bill when you need him," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to herself. While the two men were struggling, Annabel raised her eyebrows at <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> as if to say, "you can handle this." So <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> looked around, grabbed an oversized pitcher of iced tea and poured it on the belligerent patron's head. Thus startled, he was quickly ejected.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was immediately intrigued with this friendly stranger, who introduced himself as Chad. He had a warm way about him, and, and he seemed more approachable than most of the men she encountered in the club. His compliments on her singing felt sincere and the two of them burst out laughing as they showed each other the bruises that they had to show for their encounter.</p>
<p>Chad told her that he was a concierge at the Royal Sonesta and had plans to start his own <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> club called "Chad's Pad."</p>
<p> "So you were just scouting out the talent," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> teased Chad.</p>
<p> "Actually, that's exactly what I was doing," Chad replied. He told her he already rented the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and gave her the address. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> said she had to leave, but she'd check it out. She headed home, leaving Platinum Dolls for the last <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. And as for Chad, the smile she left him indicated she'd be seeing him again.</p>
<p>She came home earlier than usual, and found a stranger waiting by her front door.</p>
<p> "What do you want," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> asked.</p>
<p> "Shawn's got something to give me," came the reply. Uh oh, this doesn't sound good, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to herself. She went into the house and found that Shawn wasn't there. She was about to go back out and tell the impatient visitor to come back later when it suddenly dawned on her what Shawn had been up to. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> got the same confident look from her guardian angel, so she knew what to do.</p>
<p> "Oh, Shawn had an errand to run, he asked me to give it to you," she said. "Now where did he say he was keeping it?"</p>
<p> "Oh, in the usual place, behind the loose tile in the bathroom."</p>
<p> "Okay, just a moment," <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> replied.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> had always noticed the loose tile but had never <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to look behind it. She went to look and sure enough, there was a large tin filled with pills. She felt stupid for not realizing what she now felt should have been obvious. And while many of the girls at "Dolls" were hard drug users, she had always realized this was a path she needed to avoid. For all of her father's weaknesses, he had always cautioned her against getting involved with illegal drugs (other than marijuana, in which he had indulged during Blueberry days). She flushed the pills down the toilet and then told the waiting stranger that she had found nothing there, and that Shawn must have the delivery with him. So the stranger left. When he was out of sight, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> filled her car with her <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and belongings and left the house for good.</p>
<p>She <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> she should be upset, but somehow she felt empowered. "That's not bad for one afternoon," she <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to herself, "leaving my job, my boyfriend, and my house." She drove around by herself for a while and then sought out Chad. Not finding him at the Royal Sonesta, she tried to find Chad's Pad. It took a while to find, as it wasn't listed and no one had heard of it. She was not familiar with the side street he had given her, and after driving around the grid of small streets near Bourbon Street for a half hour, she finally found it, a small basement room with a cardboard sign.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> found Chad there by himself (except for a stray <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>) opening boxes of imitation wood siding. He was delighted to see her and handed her a hammer.</p>
<p> "Hey, not so fast, what's in this for me?" <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> asked.</p>
<p> "Well, you can be our opening headliner."</p>
<p> "Yeah, whom I gonna sing for--you and the cat?"</p>
<p> "Well that would be nice, here have a seat," Chad said as he pulled up a wooden box for <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to sit on. So she dusted off the box, sat down, sang her most recent lyrics, "Why Don't You Come Out and Play." And with Chad's enthusiastic reaction, she accepted the offer of the hammer.</p>
<p>Upon waking the next morning (at Chad's other pad), <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> had a better idea.</p>
<p> "New Orleans doesn't need yet another random <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> dive," she exclaimed over breakfast. "Let's do something a little different--how about we just feature the ladies?"</p>
<p> "You mean a club like Dolls, what's unique about that?"</p>
<p> "No, no, I mean a <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> club with chick singers, like me."</p>
<p>Chad was hesitant, but he could see that <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was taken with the idea, and he was becoming taken with her. So Chad and <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> became partners and spent the next several weeks scrounging up materials to renovate their new club, devoted to the "Ravens" of New Orleans.</p>
<p>Opening night featuring <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and Lisa, one of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s a talented friends, as headliners. But customers were hard to attract in New Orleans' crowded <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> scene, and Ravens found it difficult to get established. They did ultimately succeed in attracting a small but loyal following and Chad and <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> struggled to keep the project going through the next two years.</p>
<p>Then <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> had another idea. The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">world wide web</a> was just beginning to blossom. Why not create a virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> club, still devoted to <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> singers, but existing only on the web? They could reach <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> lovers all over the world. Chad acknowledged that he had never actually seen the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, so she gave him a tour of the web circa 1995. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s idea was to provide real <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and real stories behind real lives, using words, pictures, <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, and video. Let people connect with the people behind the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. Chad knew enough not to get in <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s way when she became enamoured with an idea. So they struck another deal, shutting down Ravens as a physical club and opened <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">www</a>.RealRavens.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>, a site devoted to the "real <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and stories behind the 'ravens' of New Orleans". <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> did all the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming, and recruited the singers. Chad put up the money from his salary at the hotel. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> helped the girls write their stories and rummage through old photo albums.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> found it too difficult to stream audio, let alone video with the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of 1995. So their plan to charge users didn't pan out. They did charge a small fee to the musicians for being on the site, but the early cash flow generated by their business was limited. However, their overhead was also low, and <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and Chad ran their small business from their small apartment. In 1996, when audio on the web did become feasible, they added <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> recordings, and eventually live streaming concerts.</p>
<p>And of course, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> promoted herself as one of the featured ravens, which led to successful gigs in some of the Bourbon Street clubs. Chad turned out to be an effective business partner for <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, but the romantic aspect of their relationship never achieved the intensity of their work together. He was always complaining that she was putting the web site and her singing first and him second, so she was not totally surprised when she discovered that Chad had become involved with Lisa. She felt it was again <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to move on.</p>
<p>She had renewed her contact with her father and was delighted to hear that he and Claire had separated. She made an <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al homecoming, and was greeted with open and embracing arms. She was disturbed to find that Claire had ended up with the small house that they had struggled to buy, and that her father was now living in a run down boarding house. But she was no stranger to difficult circumstances, and she helped her father decorate his small room with some of her <a class="thought" href="entries/graphic_design_entry.html">graphic design</a>s. Father and daughter began to play <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> together, something they had never done before. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s month long visit was an idyllic <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as she and her father spent long hours perfecting her songs. She was amazed at her father's insights into her <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, and felt a renewed confidence in herself as a musical artist.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> returned to New Orleans, and decided to put her relationship with Chad on a more professional footing. She hired an attorney who helped her sort out their tangled finances. She got the business incorporated, and cut herself a fair share of the stock. The cash flow from RealRavens.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a> was now picking up, and she gave herself the title of webmistress as well as a salary. And for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in her <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, she got her own apartment.</p>
<p>She recruited musicians, who were plentiful in New Orleans, and found herself a keyboardist, guitarist, and drummer. Borrowing from the name of her web site, she called her new band "<a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and the Ravens," which developed a strong following in the New Orleans alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> scene.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, both of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s "Raven" projects flourished. She had enough money to send some back to her father, who frequently came out to watch her perform.</p>
<p>On July 26, 2000, SIGGRAPH, the nation's leading <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics show came to New Orleans, and <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> went to check it out. She heard <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>, who, in his keynote address, talked about how in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> we will be spending most of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, and that in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> you can be anyone you want to be.</p>
<p>She approached Raymond after his presentation (in a "lucid" <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, actually), and pointed out to him that, seeing as she was his <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego, perhaps he would like to create her.</p>
<p>And so he did. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a> and his staff created <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> along with her story in the Autumn of 2000. Although created 24 years after her birth, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> feels that her <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is just as real as the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of people in real reality. After all, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> likes to point out, our memories just exist as patterns in our heads anyway.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is looking forward to other people joining her in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. "Real reality is just so lame," she points out. "It's a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> lonely here, but I've always liked being a pioneer."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is looking forward to her debut as a real virtual singer at the TED conference, and she confesses to having developed something of a crush on <a class="thought" href="entries/wurman_entry.html">Richard Saul Wurman</a>, TED's impresario. She was delighted to learn that Richard is joining her team of virtual dancers.</p><h1>Some pertinent facts about <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a></h1><p>Zodiac sign: Aquarius</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hmmmm. That article giving a bio on Ramona as if there were a real person behind the virtual image reminds me of the even more involved attempts by Attitude studio in France to create a fake identity for their own virtual creation, Eve Solal.  It took a lot of work in both cases, but it misses the whole point of having a virtual being.  By imposing a traditional persona you are giving too much detail.  Ho-hum, another boring meat being, was my first reaction when I read the Eve Solal fragments, and I feel inclined in a same way towards the Ramona bio.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Bull, the bio gives the Ramona character depth.  It does make a small mistake by giving Remona a real world bio instead of a virtual one but it is better then an empty program to be forgotten with the next upgrade.  This bio needs to be an example of how the program was developed and some fiction as to Remona's feeling during the process, but other then that it is very good.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>An AI programmed by humans, atleast one deliberately so, is probably going to have human type feelings.  That is when the systems become advanced enough to calculate emotions, or atleast soudo emotions.
<br>
<br>
That was the pupose of the... well I don't remember which museum ran the project, but, oh well.  Anyway, they created a robotic tour guide that had emotional states based on varios inputs.  It even got mad and reacted differently to the same stimulus while in different emotional states.  When humans deliberately create AI's they will either program them to be generally like people, or totally different, probably emotionless.  
<br>
<br>
Besides their is an advantage to reacting in the way that emotions prompt you to, atleast from a basic survival or evolutionary stand point.
<br>
<br>
An unintentionally created AI will probably be similar to humans only on the reptilian level.  The rest of it's emotional states, if any, and it's thought processes would be shaped by it's base programming and experiences.  Sound similar to anybody you know?  The difference here between a person and this theoretical AI is that the AI would have a vastly different starting point and different experiences then a person would.

Oh, and this forum is for discussion, not nit picking, kindly knock it off.</p></td>

<br>
Does Mr. Kurzweil know the origin of the name, that it comes from the book "Ramona" written in the late 19th century by Helen Hunt Jackson?  I was named from the book!  Thank you for reading this.
