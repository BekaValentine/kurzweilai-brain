<p> In the last year I've been involved in the development of an alternative 
              theory that turns the cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> topsy-turvy. All the events 
              that created the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant features of our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> occur in a different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, by different <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, at different times, over different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scales&#8212;and yet this model seems capable of reproducing 
              all of the successful predictions of the consensus picture with 
              the same exquisite detail. </p>
<p>I am a theoretical cosmologist, so I am addressing the issue from 
              that point of view. If you were to ask most cosmologists to give 
              a summary of where we stand right now in the field, they would tell 
              you that we live in a very special period in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> where, 
              thanks to a whole host of advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we can suddenly 
              view the very distant and very early <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> in ways that we haven't 
              been able to do ever before. </p>
<p>For example, we can get a snapshot of what the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> looked 
              like in its infancy, when the first atoms were forming. We can get 
              a snapshot of what the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> looked like in its adolescence, 
              when the first stars and galaxies were forming. And we are now getting 
              a full detail, three-dimensional image of what the local <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              looks like today. When you put together this different <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              which we're getting for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, you obtain 
              a very tight series of <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s on any model of cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. 
            </p>
<p>If you go back to the different theories of cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in 
              the early 1990's, the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> we've gathered in the last decade has 
              eliminated all of them&#8212;save one, a model that you might think 
              of today as the consensus model. This model involves a combination 
              of the Big Bang model as developed in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s; 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">Inflation</a>ary Theory, which Alan Guth proposed in the 1980s; 
              and a recent amendment that I will discuss shortly. This consensus 
              theory matches the observations we have of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> today in 
              exquisite detail. For this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, many cosmologists conclude that 
              we have finally determined the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>But I have a rather different point of view, a view that has been 
              stimulated by two events. The first is the recent amendment to which 
              I referred earlier. I want to argue that the recent amendment is 
              not simply an amendment, but a real shock to our whole notion of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. And secondly, in the last year I've been 
              involved in the development of an alternative theory that turns 
              the cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> topsy-turvy. All the events that created the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant features of our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> occur in a different <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, by 
              different <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, at different times, over different <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scales&#8212;and 
              yet this model seems capable of reproducing all of the successful 
              predictions of the consensus picture with the same exquisite detail. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>The key difference between this picture and the consensus picture 
              comes down to the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The standard model, or consensus 
              model, assumes that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> has a beginning that we normally refer 
              to as the Big Bang. According to this model, for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s we don't 
              quite understand, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> sprang from nothingness into somethingness, 
              full of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, and has been expanding and cooling for 
              the past 15 billion years. </p>
<p>In the alternative model, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is endless. <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> is endless 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that it goes on forever in the past and forever in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, and, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> is endless. Indeed, our three 
              spatial dimensions remain infinite throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>More specifically, this model proposes a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> in which the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is cyclic. That is to say, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              goes through periods of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> from hot to cold, from dense to 
              under-dense, from hot radiation to the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> we see today, and 
              eventually to an empty <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Then, a sequence of events occurs 
              that cause the cycle to begin again. The empty <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is reinjected 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, creating a new period of expansion and cooling. This 
              process repeats periodically forever. What we're witnessing now 
              is simply the latest cycle. <br>
</p>
<p>The notion of a cyclic <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is not new. People have considered 
              this idea as far back as recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. The ancient Hindus, for 
              example, had a very elaborate and detailed <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> based on a 
              cyclic <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. They predicted the duration of each cycle to be 
              8.64 billion years&#8212;a prediction with three-digit accuracy. 
              This is very impressive, especially since they had no <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> 
              and no <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a>! It disagrees with the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> that I'm going 
              suggest, which is trillions of years rather than billions. <br>
</p>
<p>The cyclic notion has also been a recurrent theme in Western <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. 
              Edgar Allan Poe and Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, each had cyclic 
              models of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and in the early days of relativistic <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/einstein_entry.html">Albert Einstein</a>, Alexandr Friedman, Georges Lema&#238;tre, and 
              Richard Tolman were interested in the cyclic idea. I think it is 
              clear why so many have found the cyclic idea to be appealing: If 
              you have a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> with a beginning, you have the challenge of 
              explaining why it began and the conditions under which it began. 
              If you have a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, which is cyclic, it is eternal, so you don't 
              have to explain the beginning.<br>
</p>
<p>During the attempts to try to bring cyclic ideas into modern <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>, 
              it was discovered in the '20s and '30s that there are various technical 
              problems. The idea at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was a cycle in which our three-dimensional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> goes through periods of expansion, beginning from the Big 
              Bang, and then reversal to contraction and a <a class="thought" href="entries/big_crunch_entry.html">big crunch</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              bounces and expansion begins again. One problem is that, every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> contracts to a crunch, the density and temperature 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> rises to an infinite value, and it is not clear 
              if the usual laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> can be applied. </p>
<p>Second, every cycle of expansion and contraction creates <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> 
              through natural thermodynamic processes, which adds to the <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> 
              from earlier cycles. So, at the beginning of a new cycle, there 
              is higher <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> density than the cycle before. It turns out that 
              the duration of a cycle is sensitive to the <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> density. If 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> increases, the duration of the cycle increases as well. 
              So, going forward in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, each cycle becomes longer than the one 
              before. </p>
<p>The problem is that, extrapolating back in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the cycles become 
              shorter until, after a finite <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, they shrink to zero duration. 
              The problem of avoiding a beginning has not been solved. It has 
              simply been pushed back a finite <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of cycles. If we're going 
              to reintroduce the idea of a truly cyclic <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, these two problems 
              must be overcome. The cyclic model that I will describe uses new 
              ideas to do just that. <br>
</p>
<p>To appreciate why an alternative model is worth pursuing, its <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              to get a more detailed impression of what the consensus picture 
              is like. Certainly some aspects are appealing. But, what I want 
              to argue is that, overall, the consensus model is not so simple. 
              In particular, recent observations have forced us to amend the consensus 
              model and make it more complicated. So, let me begin with an overview 
              of the consensus model. </p>
<p>The consensus theory begins with the Big Bang: the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> has 
              a beginning. It's a standard assumption that people have made over 
              the last 50 years, but it's not something we can prove at present 
              from any fundamental laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. Furthermore, you have to assume 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> began with an <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> density less than the critical 
              value. Otherwise, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> would stop expanding and recollapse 
              before the next stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary epoch. In addition, 
              to reach this <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary stage, there must be some sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              to drive the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>. </p>
<p>Typically this is assumed to be due to an <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> field. You 
              have to assume that in those patches of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that began 
              at less than the critical density, a significant fraction of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is stored in <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> so that it can eventually overtake 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and start the period of accelerated expansion. All 
              of these are <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able assumption, but assumptions nevertheless. 
              It's <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to count these assumptions and ingredients, because 
              they are helpful in comparing the consensus model to the challenger.
