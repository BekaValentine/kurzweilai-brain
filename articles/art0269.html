<div class="TeaserText">In <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s The <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> is Near, physicist <a class="thought" href="entries/penrose_entry.html">Sir Roger Penrose</a> is paraphrased as suggesting it is impossible to perfectly replicate a set of quantum states, so therefore perfect downloading (i.e., creating a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> or synthetic replica of the human brain based upon quantum states) is impossible. But how perfect does this copy need to be? This New Scientist article approaches the question of replication of quantum states from a similar perspective--that of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>.

<p>Will we ever be able to teleport people to faraway places? It all depends on the strange uncertainties of the quantum world.</p>
<p>To a classically trained physicist, perhaps the most galling aspect of the quantum world is the way that nothing seems real until it is measured. Suppose you want to know something about a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> - say the polarization of a <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> of light. Before you make the measurement, the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> isn't really polarized in a particular direction. Instead, it has a ghostly range of possible polarizations, each with some probability of being measured. When you measure the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>'s polarization you will get a definite answer. But the snag is, all the other ghostly possibilities will vanish in the process, and the original, indefinite state is lost forever.</p>
<p>So the act of measuring a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> actually destroys some of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about its pristine state. That would seem to make it practically impossible to copy such particles and reproduce them elsewhere. But ironically, one of the quantum world's strange tricks turns this argument on its head. It turns out that you can re-create an unmeasured quantum state - as long as you are prepared to sacrifice the original. The trick exploits the very uncertainty that makes quantum measurements so puzzling in the first place.</p>
<p>It was the physicist Charles Bennett from <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>'s labs at Yorktown Heights in New York who introduced the world to the idea of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a> in 1993 - in theory that is. Bennett and his co-workers found a way for an imaginery character called Alice to teleport a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> to her friend Bob, some distance away. What happens is that Bob creates a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> in exactly the same state as Alice's original <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> - even though Alice never knew what that state was.</p>
<p>Suppose Alice and Bob wanted to copy a <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>. Alice can't just measure her <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> and send the results to Bob, because that would destroy some of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> Bob needs. Fortunately, quantum theory has a more subtle means of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. An extra pair of "entangled" photons opens up the <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a> channel between Alice and Bob.</p>
<p>According to quantum theory, you can tangle up a pair of photons so that their properties are inextricably linked. This holds true even if you send them to opposite ends of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>: measure one <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> at the North Pole and you immediately determine the state of the other <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> at the South Pole.</p>
<p>Perplexed? You're in good company. In fact, <a class="thought" href="entries/einstein_entry.html">Albert Einstein</a> and his younger colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen dreamt up this <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> scenario to show just how absurd and unacceptable <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> was. It appears to demand the impossible - measurements in one place producing an instantaneous effect somewhere else. Ironically, experiments have shown that "EPR" pairs of particles do indeed communicate in this "spooky" (Einstein's word) fashion. More of this later. For now there's Alice and Bob's problem to solve.</p>
<p>Alice has an unmeasured, pristine <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> that she wants to teleport to Bob. First, she creates a pair of linked EPR photons, keeping one with her while sending the other off to Bob. She then arranges for her unmeasured <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> to interact with her EPR <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>, measures the result of that interaction, and sends the answer on to Bob the old-fashioned way - by phone, e-mail, fax or carrier pigeon.</p>
<p>And now the mysterious part. Bob receives Alice's message, and depending on what it says, performs some prearranged <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> on his EPR <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> - the other half of the entangled pair that Alice created. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, he might change the polarization of his <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> by an amount that depends on the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> Alice sent him. At the end of this procedure, Bob's <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> has become an exact replica of Alice's original unmeasured <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>. The quantum state of that <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> - although not the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> itself - has been teleported from Alice to Bob.</p>
<p>What's going on here? Well, to re-create the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> - to teleport it - you need to transmit two kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about its state. One kind is the ordinary, everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. That's the easy part. You can measure it and send the details by an ordinary route. But what about the quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> - the stuff that disappears when you make your measurement? The trick to transmitting this lies in the secret, spooky connection between Alice and Bob's EPR photons. By persuading her unknown <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> to interact with her EPR <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>, Alice made Bob's EPR <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>, the other half of the entangled pair, interact with the unknown <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> as well.</p>
<p>Via the spooky EPR channel, Bob therefore receives some strange, quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about the state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> Alice wants to teleport. That's not the whole story though, because Alice also has to measure something about the interaction of her two photons, and send the result to Bob. But if all is done correctly, Bob receives a combination of spooky quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and plain old classical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that allows him to reproduce Alice's original unknown <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this is an extremely tricky <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> to get right. The joint measurement that Alice makes on the unknown <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> and her EPR <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> must be carefully designed and executed. Alice and Bob have to ensure the EPR photons remain absolutely untouched by any unwanted external interaction. If either <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> were to bump into a stray atom somewhere along the way, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, that would destroy their spooky connection. But last year two teams of scientists, one at the University of Innsbruck and the other at the University of Rome, managed to teleport a <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>. From one side of their lab to another, anyway.</p>
<p>There are a few interesting provisos about this process. First, Alice has to send Bob the results of her measurements by a standard, slower-than-light means, so even though the spooky part of <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a> is instantaneous, the equally essential non-spooky part is not. Quantum teleporting can't happen faster than light, something Einstein would be pleased to learn. Second, Alice's measurement destroys the quantum state of her original <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>. Third, neither Alice nor Bob will ever actually know what that original quantum state was. Directly measuring a quantum state will always destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about it in an unpredictable way. Alice can teleport a quantum state to Bob only on the strict understanding that neither party can ever know exactly what state they teleported.</p>
<p>But what does all of this mean for <i>Star Trek</i> style <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>, where an entire person is transported from one place to another? Certain difficulties spring to mind. To teleport a collection of atoms, rather than just a single <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>, the EPR channel of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> has to transmit not just one item of spooky quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> but a whole package of it. This requires not just a large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> EPR pairs, which would be bad enough, but a single EPR complex encompassing a huge <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of particles. It would be well nigh impossible to construct such a state, let alone send it off into the ether without destroying its integrity.</p>
<p>And that's not at all. To teleport Jean-Luc Picard, you would have to send a complete specification of the collective quantum state of every last <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> and atom in his body - all in an instant. A tall order. Alice would have to devise a single, instantaneous measurement that would ensnare all this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> at once, and Bob would have to perform a similarly complex reconstruction at the other end. And suppose you destroy Jean-Luc Picard's quantum representation in one place and re-create it in another. Would the reconstruction be, in every respect, the same man? Would it act as the original would have acted? That's for you to figure out...</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The final comment of the New Scientist article, is telling. It states that all the electrons and other particles would have to be perfectly copied in Picard's Transporter. Attacking this question as a philosophical/rhetorical matter; why assume otherwise?  One can imagine a hyper-advanced NMR device, coupled with 'entangled particles' accomplishing just this.  
<br>
<br>
As to questions of identity, why not just go with pattern identity theory, until you have evidence to the contrary that the resulting "transported" or "uploaded" person is not the same pattern as the original?
<br>
<br>
Finally, an uploading that leaves the original "person" behind, alive, awake, and aware, then one has merely generated a type of clone. Neurobiologically, perhaps one could simply transfer the regions of the brain that consist of the personality? How much of the personality and memories are also the limbic and enteric neurons, is unknown to me, so perhaps someone else may suggest a solution.

<br>
As I see ... there are only instances 'of a person'. Self. 
<br>
<br>
And that explains manything:
<br>
<br>
- why the hell I am alive exactly in this particular (short) time  and why I came to the existence, when it was so improbable?
<br>
<br>
I am 'alive' in all times and places, where the self awareness is. It couldn't happened otherwise - that 'my another brother' has been born, if another sperm has won. 
<br>
<br>
I am not unique at all!
<br>
<br>
The teleportation just creates another instance, which (coincidentally) has the same memory. Or hasn't.

When I state this, I do not necessaruly mean those that have been cryonically preseved or even consecutively uploaded, but the rest of humanity or other intelligent life, that can be restored.
<br>
<br>
One reason for this is to ask the "resurrected" to ask "if they feel they are the person?" I am primarilly concerned with "survival" though, and am less drawn toward merely dicussing the identity issue. Why discuss unicorns if there never were and never will be unicorns? :)
