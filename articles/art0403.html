<p>Originally published 1999 in Situating Sarkar:Tantra, Macrohistory and Alternative Futures (Maleny and Ananda Nagar, Gurukul Publications, 1999). Published on KurzweilAI.net February 19, 2002.</p><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><p>The ubiquitous dominance of the scientific discourse has traditionally been criticized by humanists, contextualized within a <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of paradigms by Thomas Kuhn,<sup>1</sup> and more recently placed within a theory of epistemes--the boundaries of the construction of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>--by poststructuralists and writers such as Foucault and interpreters of him, among others, Michael Shapiro.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, writers like Ashis Nandy<sup>3</sup> have attempted to synthesize the many critiques of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> focusing their efforts on the <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of the third world, particularly the epistemological implications of the works of Gandhi.  What follows here is a short essay that continues this project but attempts to inject an alternative perspective, that of P.R. Sarkar's, into the "what is <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>" or the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>/culture debate.  Shrii Sarkar, we argue, develops a new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> that is neither solely cyclical (past-oriented) nor <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> (present-oriented) and a new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that does not fall into the various modern (pro or anti) <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> positions.  He does not reinscribe the Western model of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of modernity nor does he merely develop a local <a class="thought" href="entries/indigenous_entry.html">indigenous</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">SCIENCE</a> INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">POLITICS</a></h1><p>Traditional theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> have attempted to place <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and thereby <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> outside of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, culture and <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>.  In this view, the goal of good <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is to remove subjectivity. The goal is disinterest <u>and</u> distance from the results of investigation.</p>
<p>This type of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> has led critics to argue that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> (and its brain-child, legitimate or bastard, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>) is amoral, without <a class="thought" href="entries/conscience_entry.html">conscience</a>.  In his <u>Traditions, Tyranny, and Utopias</u>, Ashis Nandy criticizes those who wish to place themselves outside of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> (the modern liberal scientists and the modern scientific socialist project).  Both seek to end <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> not through <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> liberation--as the yogi--but through the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for the perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> either through the magic of the marketplace (greed leading to <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>) or the magic of the communist state or non-state (power leading to justice).  Central to both these projects has been the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> revolution.  In Nandy's words "the image of the scientist as a slightly seedy natural philosopher and practitioner of an esoteric discipline, and that of the technologist as a humble craftsman or artisan, gradually underwent a change.  Both became partners in a new, high paying, heady enterprise called modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>."<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>But the modern scientist did not stop there.  "He was to see the idea that while each technological achievement marked the success of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, each technological perversion was the responsibility of either the technologist or his political and economic mentors, not that of the scientist."<sup>5</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> constructed the world in which those with <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to this worldview created the Other as primitive, as historical forms that need to be developed, to be modernized. This is also <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> evolutionary theory with its social <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> of developmentalism: Marx or Rostow.  Both Edward Said in <u>Orientalism</u> <sup>6</sup> and Frantz Fanon in <u>Black Skins/White Masks</u> <sup>7</sup> have also passionately developed criticisms of this discourse. </p><h1>LOCAL <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">SCIENCE</a></h1><p>Contrasting this has been the view of, among others, Gandhi, who sought to develop a local Indian <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.  Recently, as well, a great deal of literature has argued for a local <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> perspective; one in which <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is not dominated by Western "universalizing" <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> practices but one where <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is relevant to the local culture.  For example, Pakistan has attempted to develop an Islamic <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.  However, while this indigenization of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is enabling in that it does not attempt to merely mimic the Western model of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, it does lead to situations in which old power structures--the landlords and mullahs/Brahmins--are renewed.  Instead of an alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> or a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> committed to the empirical, what results are conferences where "inshallah" is repeated after every scientific formula (H2O, <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> willing)<sup>8</sup> or the Vedas are uttered continuously in the hopes of alchemically transforming the physical into the spiritual.  Here, while <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has now become placed in an alternative cultural site, it has lost its openness to critique and debate; an openness necessary for any creative development.  While freed from modernity, this indigenization of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> perspective has become frozen in the historical ideational-religious traditions.</p>
<p>Compare this to the New Age <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> articulated by writers such as Willis Harmon<sup>9</sup>, Marilyn Ferguson<sup>10</sup> and Fritjof Capra.<sup>11</sup>  This alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> claims to have reconciled <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and values through the rediscovery of ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> and through the reinterpretation of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>.  The aim is not toward a local <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> but a new universal <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> that is not reductionist; rather it is holistic with truth simultaneously having many levels and at the same time grounded in a <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> that exists ontologically prior to the intellectual mind.  Central to this reconciliation is the creation of a planetary spiritual <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> that exists outside of the present industrial nation-state Cartesian <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>.  From this New Age view, the indigenization of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, while creative in its anti-Western stance, is but a continuation of a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> regime controlled by those who ruled in pre-modern eras, that is, the priests, mullahs, and others whose robes kept them free from moral impurity (and interestingly this is isomorphic to the robe or frock of the scientist who too must be free of values or be free from the contamination of the organisms released in his experiments).   From the view of modernity, this indigenization of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is the return of superstition, of the power of local tales, local priests, and backward institutions.  Similarly, from the view of the traditional modern scientific discourse the New Age <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> is merely bad <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> or at best mediocre <a class="thought" href="entries/metaphysics_entry.html">metaphysics</a>.</p>
<p>But for Nandy, <u>superstition</u> is not the danger.  Local <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> or New Age <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> are not the problem.  Rather, "modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has built a <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of near total isolation where human beings--including all their suffering and moral <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>--have been objectified as things and processes, to be vivisected, manipulated or corrected."<sup>12</sup> Although modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> claims to be pluralistic, it has become authoritarian; at least in traditional cultures there were a variety of gurus, or perceptions of the real vying for allegiance.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> then at one time pluralized our view of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, of <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.  In the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of P.R. Sarkar's, it helped end the domination of the <u>vipras</u> and their ideational worldview and created the <u>vaeshyan</u> sensate worldview, that is, the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> revolution that aided in created the modern world.</p>
<p>Gandhi, then, (and others involved in the local <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> project), as Ashis Nandy argues, comes out as one who attempted to create an alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>; he rejected the technologism of modernity and the Western categories exported through Orientalism.  But how might Gandhi react to the new world of clones, global <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>, genetic engineering and space travel?  Are they merely the continued tradition of bureaucracy and control or are we on the verge of a new world?  How should local and Western <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> deal with the dramatic restructuring potential of the new technologies (genetic, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, space) that make our local and universal perspectives problematic. They destroy both worlds and eras?</p><h1>SARKAR'S <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">SCIENCE</a> OF <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">SOCIETY</a></h1><p>P.R. Sarkar tries an alternative, unconventional approach.  He does not attempt to support "universal" positive <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> nor the various forms of local <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.  Rather Sarkar's interest is to create a new <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> which is essentially spiritual but inclusive of the physical and mental. He does not locate <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> in mere reflection; rather to him life a struggle with the environment and with ideas (<a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> develops through this struggle. Thus social change is material and ideational) and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> comes through the attraction of the Great (thus it is spiritual).  </p>
<p>Sarkar begins with a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, essentially a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in which there are four basic structures that create our subjectivities: the worker, the warrior, the intellectual, and the accumulator (here radically reinterpreting the classic Indian caste construction).  The structures are associated with personality types, classes and with historical eras.  </p>
<p>He locates this discussion in a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> instead of an art in that these structures are evolutionary and thus law-like. Thus these stages are historical.  For Sarkar they are not metaphysically deduced. They are part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.  But not <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> merely in the modern sense of empirically derived.  For Sarkar <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is defined not by the site of the material, but by <u>causality</u>, by "<u>systematicity</u>," and by the <u>rational</u>.  That is, important in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is not authority or devotion (two ways of knowing the real) but <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> and sense-inference.  Superstition is when the self is located in the ego, one's geography, ideology or in "speciesism"; the goal is to move toward a placement that is outside of conventional boundaries--a type of spiritual universalism.  </p>
<p>In this definition, the spiritual can become the scientific.  It becomes intuitional <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, synthetic in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, while material <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is analytic and inference based.  Both are necessary.   This is different from the Western placement where <a class="thought" href="entries/epistemology_entry.html">epistemology</a> was divided into authority (<a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>), inference (<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>), logic (<a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>). Sarkar's goal is to begin a rational intuitional <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. The classic Indian episteme, which Sarkar emerges from exists in a unity of discourse; the division of Vico (understanding) and Weber (explanation) do not occur here.<sup>13</sup>  For Sarkar there are five ways of knowing the real: <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, sense inference, <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, authority and devotion/love.   Each way of knowing the real has its price, so to say; it is only with devotion/love that real <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is possible and contradiction-free.  Sarkar can thus arrive at his theories intuitionally and claim that they are scientific in that they are systematic, rational, and have causal links.  In addition, his theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> can be scientific in that from the Indian episteme the social is in <a class="thought" href="entries/harmony_entry.html">harmony</a> and is parallel with the physical and the cosmic.  It would be surprising if there were no social laws!<sup>14</sup>  However, at the same time (and this is the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>), the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is not closed, it is not clock-like since <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> is emanating new forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.  However, the openness of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> (that there is agency, human choice) only affects the social <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> in the long run (following Rupert Sheldrake<sup>15</sup> and his morphogenetic <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> fields); in the short run it provides inspiration to individuals to transform themselves and then the world about them.  Sarkar's claim to the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> discourse again is different from the socialist scientific law or the scientific laws based on modern developmental theory (a la Spencer) in that for Sarkar if is not that he is correct and they are false, that discoveries of the social were based on false <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> prior to him, but rather that there are different levels of the real, different philosophers are in touch with different levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.  The only absolute truth is pure <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a>; however, that truth cannot be expressed, for when expressed it falls under local influences, that is, culture, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>--power.</p>
<p>Finally, insofar as the scientific enterprise exists to improve the conditions of the material and mental worlds, Sarkar's theory gives new political assets to worker--as well as to the other classes (the oppressor and the oppressed must both liberate themselves from the particular social formation they find themselves in).  His theory also more fully explains human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. His social theory reinterprets <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> allowing previously silenced voices to be heard and allowing hidden structures to emerge (his four fold <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of power).  His <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is not apolitical, rather it is expressly political (in terms of creating new meanings) in rethinking <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and in creating an alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>--of the possibilities of change, of governance.  </p>
<p>Notice how the view of Sarkar is different from the work of other spiritual groups and their journals, for example, the journal <u>Vedic and Modern </u><u>Science</u>.<sup>16</sup>  The goal there is to place intuitional <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in empirical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>--as a subset of material <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>--thus attempting to prove that <a class="thought" href="entries/meditation_entry.html">meditation</a> leads to stock markets rising.  The <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of this statement (why are stock markets necessarily good, do they meet basic needs?) and its location in liberalism and <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> is not admitted. Rather each article is followed by the endless academic degrees of its author in an attempt to show legitimacy to the professional scientific community.  This journal, instead of reconstructing <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and the spiritual, merely attempts to place the spiritual within the empirical discourse, an empirical discourse which is naively believed to be apolitical.  <a class="thought" href="entries/meditation_entry.html">Meditation</a> here exists not to re-enchant the world, to see it anew and to recreate our various subjectivities, but rather <a class="thought" href="entries/meditation_entry.html">meditation</a> is needed to succeed in the material, modern world.</p>
<p>However, what emerges from Sarkar's attempt to re-enchant the material with the spiritual besides new social theory are a range of new theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is desire-based not Darwinian mutation-based).  One central <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> is the postulation of new particles called <u>microvita</u> that are both mind and body, that can be used to spread <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, that carry viruses and solve the traditional mind/body dichotomy. They are the emanations of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a>. Thus there is <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> but there is change--the spiritual does not close the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, as mentioned above, it guides it.</p><h1>THEORY, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">DATA</a>, VALUES AND <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">CONSCIOUSNESS</a></h1><p>But our point here is not the veracity of Sarkar's assertion but the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> space which allows him to make it intelligibly.   What Sarkar adds to the traditional triangle of theory (ideas), data (<a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>), and values (humans) is <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, not merely as rational self-reflective <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> but as presence.  While the traditional model centered on data and theory, it is only recent efforts by humanists that include values as such.  Thus critics like Nandy argue for values sited in culture, <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>.  There is then theory, data, values, and the specific <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of the observer in terms of attitude and in terms of spiritual <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> (level of awareness)--vibration.  For example, an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> might yield different results with different scientists as the mind influences the results of the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>.  At the same time, we gain interesting and exemplary forecasts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> not possible in the anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> polemic that emerge from efforts to develop local forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> (although they assert it is not <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> but the hegemonic Western <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> that is under criticism).  Sarkar can speak both in spiritual and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>.  For him, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of global governance and spiritual cooperative socialism, both <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> and scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can lead to social transformation.</p><h1>RETHINKING AND RESITUATING THE NATURAL</h1><p>Take the issue of genetic engineering.<sup>17</sup>  It is already used to increase the baby "safety rate" (to use technocratic <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>). This opens up the door for eventually using genetic engineering not for medical reasons, but for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> characteristic enhancement.  If one does not enhance one's child's characteristics, he or she will be at a disadvantage.  Other parents will make use of these new technologies as they develop and are globally diffused.  Parents may then ask for enhancements in their child's physical characteristics and mental ones if possible.  In the long run, with physical <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a> easily available physical differences may become far more important then obtaining a certain "look" (as created in fashion centers).  In fact, the physical in itself may become less important.  And as mental qualities are enhanced and easily available, the definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> too could become increasingly problematic.  This could lead to an increased value of moral values and spiritual values, that is, those values that are not producible by genetic engineering.  Thus, once physical <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a> and mental <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are available it may that the rarer spiritual and moral characteristics may increase in value. We can also expect in this scenario for the metaphor of birth itself to transform from creation to production. </p>
<p>In Sarkar's article titled "Laboratory Babies," he asserts, "a day is sure to come when human beings will make babies in laboratories.<sup>18</sup>" Eventually, just as we evolved from Australopithecus, a new <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> will develop from us.  But these <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> humans will be more creative, not caught in the physical world.  Rather they will use their <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> for new discoveries, for new inventions and for spiritual pursuits.  Indeed, these new humans will be averse to the material world, particularly of family ties.  But this type of discourse, the creation of humans, normally is considered obscene from the humanistic (religious or spiritual) viewpoint.  But for Sarkar it is evolutionary.  Eventually humans will co-create the real, the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> along with <u>Prakrti</u> (<a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a>) (in Sarkar's <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a>, <u>Prakrti</u>, are unified but it is the latter that preforms the activity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> silently observes).  An <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> mind, having evolved through different former lives, chooses a brain in a newly developing fetus through which it can manifest its previously unfulfilled desires, no the other way around. We suddenly have a totally different type of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.  Firstly, Sarkar comes out as critical of technocratic interpretations of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. For example, he strongly asserts that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> must be placed outside the control of capitalists, and conducted for the larger moral good. <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> as currently articulated does not deal with the suffering of the miserable, rather it attempts to solve the problems of the rich. But nor does come out like Jeremy Rifkin<sup>19</sup> and other anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, who argue that scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> can but lead to ecological and social damage. Rather these positions are placed in a spiritual and political vortex, where humanity moves ahead by conquering challenges--physical, mental and spiritual.  Among these challenges is making <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> more morally and publically accountable.</p>
<p>For Sarkar there is creation and then through struggle and desire there is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> from less developed life forms to human life forms. There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> should not continue to new life forms (however created). </p>
<p>Moreover, for Sarkar, since embedded in his theory is divinity, <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and agency, it is not unproblematic that humans consciously (using the mythos of the spiritual) participate in the creation of the "natural."  In his theory of social change the divine exists as an attracting force, as a place of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> perfection.  But there is also the social (the stages of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>) and there is <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> agency. For Sarkar, (humans can and must change the world, they must make the world where the standard of living is so high that the spiritual can be easily accessible.  However since the inexpressible (absolute <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a>) cannot be expressed in <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and since the natural is ultimately a social construct, humans can change and evolve with <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, but they must do so with social responsibility (as opposed to market mechanisms).  For Sarkar, without this needed social responsibility (here siding with Rifkin), the technician will continue to solve challenges without concern for those who are influenced by them and without the placement of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, it will continue to be managed by the dominating class.</p>
<p>For Sarkar the natural, while deeply historically patterned, nonetheless is ever changing.  <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> can change who we are; it can allow humans to co-create with <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a>.  Genetic engineering does not have to be placed in the "it will destroy human <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>" discourse or in the apolitical modernity discourse of "it will solve all our problems."  Indeed, for Sarkar, as humans locate themselves less in the sexual discourse they will become more creative in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, art and music.  The creative urge in humans will be relocated from child bearing to the creation of new ideas and amenities for the betterment of the collective good.  The relocation will change the natural and lead to increasing levels of ideational and spiritual culture.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> then is situated in an alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.  Sarkar creates a new rationality that rethinks <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>.  While critical poststructural theory sees <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> as merely one way of knowing the world and Kuhn sees <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> as having its own cycles of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and Nandy historicizes <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> arguing for a view in which there is a plurality of ideas,  Sarkar, speaking from the Indian episteme, can divide <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> into intuitional and material, thus allowing more ways of knowing the real.  In addition, arguing from his view, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> become important but are now placed in an evolutionary, social model, one where the "natural" and the "spiritual" do not necessary follow the model of the religious era or the moderns; rather, he uses the past to reconstruct the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.  Both material, mental, and spiritual worlds are real (resources and challenges) and exist within an <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> wherein <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and the mystical co-exist. </p><h1>RATIONALITY AND REENCHANTMENT</h1><p>Sarkar's view, then, does not argue for an anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> position, nor does it fall into a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> discourse that exists outside the social and the political; rather <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are contextualized allowing for a new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and a new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. </p>
<p>Is this a return of Vico (and his new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>) and Marx (and his scientific stages of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>) or is it <a class="thought" href="entries/buddha_entry.html">Buddha</a> (and his radical <a class="thought" href="entries/epistemology_entry.html">epistemology</a>) and Gandhi (and his recovery of premodern culture)?  In which direction will the social sciences next move: toward empathy and interpretation or toward disinterest and distance?  Are we about to lose universals as <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and power is localized and relativized?  Or is a new model of the real about to  become dominant that recasts these categories of "<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>," "local," and "universal?"</p>
<p>Sarkar's works are exemplary.  Influenced by the classical Indian episteme (although Sarkar moves beyond it borrowing from Islamic, Chinese and Western cosmologies), he does not fall into an anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>, anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> trap; rather he allows for <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of the ancient cycle (there is a season for everything), of <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> (episteme, class and gender), and of the divine.  Yet at the same time <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> agency is paramount, for it is we who create the world and recreate it even as the divine and the structural give it to us.  The critical too remains. </p>
<p>In Sarkar's reconstruction of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, in his quest for reenchantment, for a new rationality, the ramifications of <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> and the construction of power are not lost sight of.</p><h1>COMPONENTS OF SOCIAL THEORY</h1><h2>Traditional, Poststructural and Sarkarian Views of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></h2><h3>1  <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">DATA</a></h3><p>From the traditional view, empirical observations are independently real with <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> merely describing the real.  <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a> is neutral. From the critical view, data is decided by the dominant discursive formation  (culture, episteme, <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, power).  <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> is seen as only the empirical because the present discursive formation privileges material, sensate <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.</p><h3>2 <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">CONSCIOUSNESS</a></h3><p>For Sarkar, level of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of experimenter influences the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>. There are many levels of interpenetrating <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. In the traditional view, mind cannot influence <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>.  </p><h3>3 THEORY</h3><p>Realm of ideas in the traditional view.</p>
<p>Dominant discursive formation (other theories  arise because of power or because of data  or because of consensual academic community;  the real is an epistemological view,)  in the critical view.               </p>
<p>For Sarkar, theory is that which leads to human betterment on physical, mental and spiritual levels; it is thus  expressly political in terms of the constitution of alternative meanings.</p><h3>4 VALUES</h3><p>In the traditional view, values are universal <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> and group preferences. In the critical view, values are based on <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and discourse--episteme.</p>
<p>Agency in terms of choosing values is problematic.</p>
<p>Disinterest is impossible.  One always speaks from a point of subjectivity.  For Sarkar the role of the divine is also significant in shaping "us."</p><h1>NOTES</h1><p>Thomas Kuhn, <u>The </u><u>Structure</u><u> of Scientific Revolutions</u>. Chicago, University of Chicago, 1962.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Reading the above article, my mind is struggling with what famous physicist rejected an article saying, "IT IS NOT EVEN WRONG."
<br>
<br>
There is nothing falsifiable in most of the mystical claptrap above. I reject, as would most clear thinking "Western" minds, the notion that true Science can be "political, western, or local."  
<br>
<br>
What seems to be happening is a hearkening back to the fuzzy brained mysticism of the east, implying that western logic and science are somehow insufficient to determine reality.
<br>
<br>
I reject this lack of clarity.  One of the reasons I find this so galling, perhaps, is that my college, "haven't a clue" 20s included a non-critical embracing of virtually anything that was branded as "spiritual, eastern, or mystical."
<br>
<br>
I now recognize this tendency for what it was/is.  Wishful thinking, a lack of willingness to deal with the harsh realities of the universe, and an intellectual laziness that does not want to undergo the genuine effort involved in clear, non-mystical thinking.
<br>
<br>
I could be wrong. I may go back to my "Eastern mystic" phase of life. And there certainly may be more to the universe than we currently know.  
<br>
<br>
But Science and rationality will be our guides, not the kind of cultural bias I see in this article.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think many educated westerners, who have typically been reared on the materialist paradigm, tend to see the scientifc method applicable only to materialistic phenomena. That "pre-cognitive analytic act" makes them apt to regard the new landscape proposed by thinkers like Sarkar and Inayatullah "fuzzy" because they don't really understand the essential transition from materialist to idealist axioms. 
<br>
<br>
What should be heartening is that Inayatullah in this article is not proposing the scientific method be scrapped, only that its catchment be extended to physical phenomena involving conciousness. 
<br>
<br>
There are already known scientific results indicating that awarness (the act of observing or concious attention) influence physical processes. To adopt an idealistic foundation for the scientific method only seeks to extend science to the benefit of humanity and all forms life.
