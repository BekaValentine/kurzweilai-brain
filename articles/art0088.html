<div class="TeaserText">What exactly is "artificial intelligence" (AI)? Stanford University Professor of Computer Science Dr. John McCarthy, a pioneer in AI, answers this question in depth for beginners.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published April 4, 2000 as an academic paper, Stanford University. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>This article for the layman answers <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> questions about <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. The opinions expressed here are not all consensus opinion among <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Extinguished philosophies lie about the cradle of every <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules.--adapted from T. H. Huxley</blockquote><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a> Questions</h1><p>Q. What is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>A. It is the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of making intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, especially intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. It is related to the similar task of using <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, but <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> does not have to confine itself to methods that are <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly observable.</p>
<p>Q. Yes, but what is <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> is the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> occur in people, many <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s and some <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>Q. Isn't there a solid definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that doesn't depend on relating it to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and not others.</p>
<p>Q. Is <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question "Is this <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> intelligent or not?"?</p>
<p>A. No. <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> involves mechanisms, and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> has discovered how to make <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s should be considered "somewhat intelligent".</p>
<p>Q. Isn't <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> about simulating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>A. Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> involves studying the problems the world presents to <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> rather than studying people or <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do.</p>
<p>Q. What about IQ? Do <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s have IQs?</p>
<p>A. No. <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> is based on the rates at which <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> develops in children. It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score to the child's age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> correlates well with various measures of success or failure in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, but making <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that can score high on <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> tests would be weakly correlated with their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back a long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities, perhaps because it measures how much <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> the child can compute with at once. However, "digit span" is trivial for even extremely limited <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>However, some of the problems on <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> tests are useful challenges for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<p>Q. What about other comparisons between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>Arthur R. Jensen [<u>Jen98</u>], a leading <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, suggests "as a <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a> hypothesis" that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are related to "quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions". I see them as speed, short term <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories.</p>
<p>Whether or not Jensen is right about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the situation in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> today is the reverse.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s have plenty of speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> designers understand well enough to put in <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Some abilities that children normally don't develop till they are teenagers may be in, and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out. The <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is further complicated by the fact that the <a class="thought" href="entries/cognitive_science_entry.html">cognitive science</a>s still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> abilities are. Very likely the organization of the intellectual mechanisms for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> can usefully be different from that in people.</p>
<p>Whenever people do better than <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on some task or <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s use a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to do as well as people, this demonstrates that the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently.</p>
<p>Q. When did <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> start?</p>
<p>A. After WWII, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. The English mathematician <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> was best <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ed by <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s rather than by building <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. By the late 1950s, there were many <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, and most of them were basing their work on <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>Q. Does <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> aim to put the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind into the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>?</p>
<p>A. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers say they have that objective, but maybe they are using the phrase metaphorically. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind has a lot of peculiarities, and I'm not sure anyone is serious about imitating all of them.</p>
<p>Q. What is the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>'s 1950 article <i>Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>ry and</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> [<u>Tur50</u>] discussed conditions for considering a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to be intelligent. He argued that if the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could successfully pretend to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent. This test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers. The observer could interact with the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> by teletype (to avoid requiring that the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> imitate the appearance or voice of the person), and the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> would try to persuade the observer that it was <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> would try to fool the observer.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is a one-sided test. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that passes the test should certainly be considered intelligent, but a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could still be considered intelligent without knowing enough about humans to imitate a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/dennett_entry.html">Daniel Dennet</a>t's book <i>Brainchildren</i> [<u>Den98</u>] has an excellent discussion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> and the various partial <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>s that have been implemented, i.e. with restrictions on the observer's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> and the subject <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of questioning. It turns out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is intelligent.</p>
<p>Q. Does <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> aim at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>A. Yes. The ultimate effort is to make <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans. However, many people involved in particular <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> areas are much less ambitious.</p>
<p>Q. How far is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> from reaching <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>? When will it happen?</p>
<p>A. A few people think that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can be achieved by writing large numbers of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s of the kind people are now writing and assembling vast <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> basis of facts in the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s now used for expressing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>However, most <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers believe that new fundamental ideas are required, and therefore it cannot be predicted when <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will be achieved.</p>
<p>Q. Are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s the right kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to be made intelligent?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s can be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to simulate any kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>Many <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers invented non-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, hoping that they would be intelligent in different ways than the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s could be. However, they usually simulate their invented <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and come to doubt that the new <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is worth building. Because many billions of dollars that have been spent in making <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s faster and faster, another kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> would have to be very fast to perform better than a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulating the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>Q. Are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s fast enough to be intelligent?</p>
<p>A. Some people think much faster <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are required as well as new ideas. My own opinion is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will keep getting faster.</p>
<p>Q. What about parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s with many processors are much faster than single processors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are somewhat awkward to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary to face this awkwardness.</p>
<p>Q. What about making a "child <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>" that could improve by reading and by <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> from experience?</p>
<p>A. This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s. Eventually, it will be made to work. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s haven't yet reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s understand <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> well enough to learn much by reading.</p>
<p>Q. Might an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> be able to bootstrap itself to higher and higher level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about AI?</p>
<p>A. I think yes, but we aren't yet at a level of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> at which this process can begin.</p>
<p>Q. What about chess?</p>
<p>A. Alexander Kronrod, a Russian <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er, said "<a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">Chess</a> is the <i>Drosophila</i> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>." He was making an <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> with geneticists' use of that fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others. <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">Chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s now play at grandmaster level, but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> player, substituting large amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> for understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that do far less <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> than do present <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s play <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> have taken precedence over using <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> as a scientific domain. It is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races.</p>
<p>Q. What about <i>Go</i>?</p>
<p>A. The Chinese and Japanese game of <i>Go</i> is also a board game in which the players take turns moving. <i>Go</i> exposes the weakness of our present understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> game playing. <i>Go</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s are very bad players, in spite of considerable effort (not as much as for <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>). The problem seems to be that a position in <i>Go</i> has to be divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed separately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this in <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> also, but <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s consider the position as a whole. <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">Chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing thousands or, in the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>, many millions of times as much <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> will overcome this scandalous weakness.</p>
<p>Q. Don't some people say that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is a bad idea?</p>
<p>A. The philosopher <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a> says that the idea of a non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is impossible. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and immoral. Various people have said that since <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> hasn't reached <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Q. Aren't computability theory and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> the keys to AI? [Note to the layman and beginners in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>: These are quite technical branches of mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>, and the answer to the question has to be somewhat technical.]</p>
<p>A. No. These theories are relevant but don't address the fundamental problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1930s mathematical logicians, especially Kurt G&#246;del and <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>, established that there did not exist <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s that were guaranteed to solve all problems in certain important mathematical domains. Whether a sentence of first <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> is a theorem is one example, and whether a polynomial equations in several variables has <a class="thought" href="entries/integer_entry.html">integer</a> solutions is another. Humans solve problems in these domains all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and this has been offered as an argument (usually with some decorations) that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are intrinsically incapable of doing what people do. However, people can't guarantee to solve <i>arbitrary</i> problems in these domains either.</p>
<p>In the 1960s <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists, especially Steve Cook and Richard Karp developed the theory of NP-complete problem domains. Problems in these domains are solvable, but seem to take <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> exponential in the size of the problem. Which sentences of propositional <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> are satisfiable is a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> example of an NP-complete problem domain. Humans often solve problems in NP-complete domains in times much shorter than is guaranteed by the general <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, but can't solve them quickly in general.</p>
<p>What is important for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is to have <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s as capable as people at solving problems. The identification of subdomains for which good <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s exist is important, but a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> problem solvers are not associated with readily identified subdomains.</p>
<p>The theory of the difficulty of general classes of problems is called <i><a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a><i>.</i> So far this theory hasn't interacted with <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> as much as might have been hoped. Success in problem solving by humans and by <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s seems to rely on properties of problems and problem solving methods that the neither the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers nor the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community have been able to identify precisely.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">Algorithm</a>ic <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_theory_entry.html">complexity theory</a> as developed by Solomonoff, Kolmogorov and Chaitin (independently of one another) is also relevant. It defines the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of a symbolic object as the length of the shortest <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that will generate it. Proving that a candidate <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is the shortest or close to the shortest is an unsolvable problem, but representing objects by short <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that generate them should be often illuminating even when you can't prove that the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is the shortest.</p><h1>Branches of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a></h1><p>Q. What are the branches of AI?</p>
<p>A. Here's a list, but some branches are surely missing, because no-one has identified them yet. Some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches.</p><h2>logical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a></h2><p>What a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act, and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> decides what to do by inferring that certain <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s are appropriate for achieving its goals. The first article proposing this was [<u>McC59</u>]. [<u>McC89</u>] is a more recent summary. [<u>McC96</u>] lists some of the concepts involved in logical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">aI</a>. [<u>Sha97</u>] is an important text.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a></h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s often examine large numbers of possibilities, e.g. moves in a <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> game or inferences by a theorem proving <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Discoveries are continually made about how to do this more efficiently in various domains.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a></h2><p>When a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> makes observations of some kind, it is often <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to compare what it sees with a pattern. For example, a vision <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to find a face. More complex patterns, e.g. in a <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> text, in a <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> position, or in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of some <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> are also studied. These more complex patterns require quite different methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most.</p><h2>representation</h2><p>Facts about the world have to be represented in some way. Usually <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s of mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> are used.</p><h2>inference</h2><p>From some facts, others can be inferred. Mathematical logical <a class="thought" href="entries/deduction_entry.html">deduction</a> is adequate for some purposes, but new methods of <i>non-monotonic</i> inference have been added to <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> since the 1970s. The simplest kind of non-monotonic <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing is default <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default, but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary. For example, when we hear of a bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin. It is the possibility that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non-monotonic character of the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. Ordinary logical <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing is monotonic in that the <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of conclusions that can the drawn from a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing</h2><p>This is the area in which <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is farthest from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level, in spite of the fact that it has been an active <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> area since the 1950s. While there has been considerable <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, e.g. in developing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of <i>non-monotonic <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing</i> and theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, yet more new ideas are needed. The <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> contains a large but spotty collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> facts.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> from experience</h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>s do that. The approaches to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> based on <a class="thought" href="entries/connectionism_entry.html">connectionism</a> and <i>neural nets</i> specialize in that. There is also <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> of laws expressed in <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>. [<u>Mit97</u>] is a comprehensive undergraduate text on <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>s can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p><h2>planning</h2><p>Planning <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s start with general facts about the world (especially facts about the effects of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s), facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal. From these, they generate a strategy for achieving the goal. In the most common cases, the strategy is just a sequence of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/epistemology_entry.html">epistemology</a></h2><p>This is a study of the kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that are required for solving problems in the world.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a></h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">Ontology</a> is the study of the kinds of things that exist. In <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and sentences deal with various kinds of objects, and we study what these kinds are and what their <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> properties are. Emphasis on <a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a> begins in the 1990s.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s</h2><p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a> is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. The term is used variously in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">Heuristic</a> <i>functions</i> are used in some approaches to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> to measure how far a <a class="thought" href="entries/node_entry.html">node</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> tree seems to be from a goal. <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">Heuristic</a> <i>predicates</i> that compare two nodes in a <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> tree to see if one is better than the other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be more useful. [My opinion].</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_programming_entry.html">genetic programming</a></h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_programming_entry.html">Genetic programming</a> is a technique for getting <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s to solve a task by mating random <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">Lisp</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and selecting fittest in millions of generations.</p><h1>Applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a></h1><p>Q. What are the applications of AI?</p>
<p>A. Here are some.</p><h2>game playing</h2><p>You can buy <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can play master level <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> for a few hundred dollars. There is some <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> in them, but they play well against people mainly through brute force <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>--looking at hundreds of thousands of positions. To beat a world champion by brute force and known reliable <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s requires being able to look at 200 million positions per second.</p><h2>speech recognition</h2><p>In the 1990s, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes. Thus United Airlines has replaced its keyboard tree for flight <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> by a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> using speech recognition of flight numbers and city names. It is quite convenient. On the the other hand, while it is possible to instruct some <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s using speech, most users have gone back to the keyboard and the <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> as still more convenient.</p><h2>understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a></h2><p>Just getting a sequence of words into a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not enough. Parsing sentences is not enough either. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has to be provided with an understanding of the domain the text is about, and this is presently possible only for very limited domains.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> vision</h2><p>The world is composed of three-dimensional objects, but the inputs to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> eye and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s' TV cameras are two dimensional. Some useful <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s can work solely in two dimensions, but full <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> vision requires partial three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that is not just a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of two-dimensional views. At present there are only limited ways of representing three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> directly, and they are not as good as what humans evidently use.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s</h2><p>A "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er" interviews experts in a certain domain and tries to embody their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for carrying out some task. How well this works depends on whether the intellectual mechanisms required for the task are within the present state of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. When this turned out not to be so, there were many disappointing results. One of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s was <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> in 1974, which diagnosed <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l infections of the blood and suggested treatments. It did better than medical students or practicing doctors, provided its limitations were observed. Namely, its <a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a> included <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, symptoms, and treatments and did not include patients, doctors, hospitals, <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, recovery, and events occurring in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Its interactions depended on a single patient being considered. Since the experts consulted by the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers knew about patients, doctors, <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, recovery, etc., it is clear that the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers forced what the experts told them into a predetermined framework. In the present state of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, this has to be true. The usefulness of current <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s depends on their users having <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a> classification</h2><p>One of the most feasible kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> given the present <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is to put some <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in one of a fixed <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of categories using several sources of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. An example is advising whether to accept a proposed credit card purchase. <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> is available about the owner of the credit card, his record of payment and also about the item he is buying and about the establishment from which he is buying it (e.g., about whether there have been previous credit card frauds at this establishment).</p><h1>More questions</h1><p>Q. How is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> done?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> has both theoretical and experimental sides. The experimental side has both <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> and applied aspects.</p>
<p>There are two main lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. One is <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, based on the idea that since humans are intelligent, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> should study humans and imitate their <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a>. The other is phenomenal, based on studying and formalizing <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> facts about the world and the problems that the world presents to the achievement of goals. The two approaches interact to some extent, and both should eventually succeed. It is a race, but both racers seem to be walking.</p>
<p>Q. What should I study before or while <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> AI?</p>
<p>A. Study <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, especially mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>. The more you learn about <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in general the better. For the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> approaches to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, study <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a> of the nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Learn some <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s-at least <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">Lisp</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/prolog_entry.html">Prolog</a>. It is also a good idea to learn one <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_language_entry.html">machine language</a>. Jobs are likely to depend on knowing the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s currently in fashion. In the late 1990s, these include <a class="thought" href="entries/c_plus_plus_entry.html">C++</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/java_entry.html">Java</a>.</p>

There was a techn race during the last war and  the cold war helped a but apart from the disasterous agreement by Academics to declare it couldn't be built aftre saying it was easy,  there hasn't been a computing race.
<br>
<br>
Iran has sucessfully giot supercomputing moving so that may spark up the Administration
<br>
<br>
John's ideas are fundamantal, and although he coined the phrase, he's the last to claim he invented it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Solving the frame problem is but one way of moving computing to achieve more, but I approach the area radically differently from time comonnet syncs.
<br>
<br>
I prefer biological modelling, ie building hardware to mimic biosystems
<br>
<br>
This carries to sofrware and they absolutely HAVE to be seen as one system.
<br>
<br>
I dont know why Stuart Russel cant get round this he's obviolsy brilliant but to even think of comupting in seperated cells is myopic.
<br>
<br>
Most of the great teachers/mentors and brilliant minds in A.I. including Minsky &amp; Deutsche think A.I. (accelerating post human intelligence) could have been here years ago...that the actual machinery that it could emerge on has been here for years if we only knew how to program it.
<br>
<br>
Nils Neilsen was the most balanced A.I. expert I've heard speak
<br>
<br>
 I feel like a scratched record, but here's a Big Mac Video for you, he has some audio tapes from his earlier times but they need to be wrestled from him and put in the public domain!
<br>
<br>
His main  fame is for inventing LISP program and format in the same data so it is easier to make programs
<br>
<br>
<br>
One wonders what dedicated careful pladding is needed to achieve something brilliant liie a compiting language that is still standared 50 years later
<br>
<br>
Mac seemed a set of contradictions the only time I've met him, extreme energy and inquisitiveness, and extreme silence and caution.
<br>
<br>
The Computing history museum is a grwt set of videos and collections and the the USA's premier gathering in this area:
