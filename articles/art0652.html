<div class="TeaserText">Despite the risks of molecular manufacturing, such as global ecophagy, replication is not new. Engineered self-replication technologies are already in wide commercial use and can be made inherently safe. And defenses we've already developed against harmful biological replicators all have analogs in the mechanical world that should provide equally effective, or even superior, defenses.

<p>One common argument against pursuing a molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> or nanofactory 
              design effort is that the end results are too dangerous. According 
              to this argument [2, 3], any researh into molecular manufacturing 
              (MM) should be blocked because this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> might be used to 
              build <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that could cause extraordinary damage. The kinds of 
              concerns that nanoweapons systems might create have been discussed 
              elsewhere, in both the nonfictional [4-6] and fictional [7] literature. 
              Perhaps the earliest-recognized and best-known danger of molecular 
              manufacturing <sup><a href="#foot1">[.1]</a></sup> is the risk that 
              self-replicating nanorobots capable of functioning autonomously 
              in the natural environment could quickly convert that natural environment 
              (e.g., "biomass") into replicas of themselves (e.g., "nanomass") 
              on a global basis, a scenario often referred to as the "gray goo 
              problem" but more accurately termed "global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a>" [4]. As Drexler 
              first warned in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i> in 1986 [8]: </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>"Plants" with "leaves" no more efficient than today's 
              solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the <a class="thought" href="entries/biosphere_entry.html">biosphere</a> 
              with an inedible foliage. Tough omnivorous "<a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>" could out-compete 
              real bacteria: They could spread like blowing pollen, replicate 
              swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of days. Dangerous 
              replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading 
              to stop&#8212;at least if we make no preparation.... We cannot afford 
              certain kinds of accidents with replicating assemblers.</blockquote>
<p>Such self-replicating systems, if not countered, could make the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> largely uninhabitable [4, 7-9]&#8212;concerns that motivated 
              the drafting of the Foresight Guidelines for the safe development 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> [10]. But, as the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology 
              explains [5], (reference annotations added):</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gray goo would entail five capabilities integrated into one small 
                package. These capabilities are: <b>Mobility</b>&#8212;the ability 
                to travel through the environment; <b>Shell</b>&#8212;a thin but 
                effective barrier to keep out diverse chemicals and ultraviolet 
                light; <b>Control</b>&#8212;a complete <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of blueprints and the 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to interpret them (even working at the nanoscale, this 
                will take significant <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>); <b>Metabolism</b>&#8212;breaking 
                down random chemicals into simple feedstock; and <b>Fabrication</b>&#8212;turning 
                feedstock into nanosystems. A nanofactory would use tiny fabricators, 
                but these would be inert if removed or unplugged from the factory. 
                The rest of the listed requirements would require substantial 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and integration [4].</p>
<p>Although gray goo has essentially no <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> and no <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
                value, and only limited terrorist value, it could be used as a 
                tool for blackmail. Cleaning up a single gray goo outbreak would 
                be quite expensive and might require severe physical disruption 
                of the area of the outbreak (atmospheric and oceanic goos [4] 
                deserve special concern for this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>). Another possible source 
                of gray goo release is irresponsible hobbyists. The challenge 
                of creating and releasing a self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> apparently 
                is irresistible to a certain personality type, as shown by the 
                large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of computer viruses and worms in <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. We probably 
                cannot tolerate a community of "script kiddies" [11] releasing 
                many modified versions of goo.</p>
<p>Development and use of molecular manufacturing poses absolutely 
                no risk of creating gray goo by accident at any point. However, 
                goo type systems do not appear to be ruled out by the laws of 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, and we cannot ignore the possibility that the five stated 
                requirements could be combined deliberately at some point, in 
                a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> small enough that cleanup would be costly and difficult. 
                Drexler's 1986 statement can therefore be updated: We cannot afford 
                criminally irresponsible misuse of powerful technologies. Having 
                lived with the threat of nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s for half a century, we 
                already know that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Attempts to block or "relinquish" [3, 12] molecular manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> will make the world a more, not less, dangerous place [13]. 
              This <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>ical conclusion is founded on two premises. First, attempts 
              to block the research will fail. Second, such attempts will preferentially 
              block or slow the development of defensive measures by responsible 
              groups. One of the clear conclusions reached by Freitas [4] was 
              that effective countermeasures against self-replicating systems 
              should be feasible, but will require significant effort to develop 
              and deploy. (Nanotechnology critic <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, responding to this 
              author, complained in late 2000 that any nanoshield defense to protect 
              against global ecophagy "appears to be so outlandishly dangerous 
              that I can't imagine we would attempt to deploy it." [12]) But blocking 
              the development of defensive systems would simply insure that offensive 
              systems, once deployed, would achieve their intended <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive in 
              the absence of effective countermeasures. James Hughes [13] concurs: 
              "The only safe and feasible approach to the dangers of emerging 
              technology is to build the social and scientific infrastructure 
              to monitor, regulate and respond to their threats."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can reasonably conclude that blocking the development of defensive 
              systems would be an extraordinarily bad idea. Actively encouraging 
              rapid development of defensive systems by responsible groups while 
              simultaneously slowing or hindering development and deployment by 
              less responsible groups ("nations of concern") would seem to be 
              a more attractive strategy, and is supported by the Foresight Guidelines 
              [10]. As even nanotechnology critic Bill Joy [14] finally admitted 
              in late 2003: "These technologies won't stop themselves, so we need 
              to do whatever we can to give the good guys a head start."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While a 100% effective ban against development might theoretically 
              be effective at avoiding the potential adverse consequences, blocking 
              all groups for all <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> does not appear to be a feasible goal. The 
              attempt would strip us of defenses against attack, increasing rather 
              than decreasing the risks. In addition, blocking development would 
              insure that the substantial economic, environmental, and medical 
              benefits [15] of this new technology would not be available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Observes Glenn Reynolds [16]:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that such efforts [to ban all development] succeed, 
                the cure may be worse than the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. In 1875, Great Britain, 
                then the world's sole superpower, was sufficiently concerned about 
                the dangers of the new technology of high explosives that it passed 
                an act barring all private <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation in explosives and rocketry. 
                The result was that German missiles bombarded London rather than 
                the other way around. Similarly, efforts to control nanotechnology, 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> are more likely to drive 
                research underground (often under covert <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> sponsorship, 
                regardless of international agreement) than they are to prevent 
                research entirely. The research would be conducted by unaccountable 
                scientists, often in rogue regimes, and often under inadequate 
                safety precautions. Meanwhile, legitimate research that might 
                cure disease or solve <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant environmental problems would suffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, and as explained elsewhere [17], it is well-known [18] 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> activities, as distinct from the inherent 
              <i><a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a></i> for self-replication, are not strictly required 
              to achieve the anticipated broad benefits of molecular manufacturing. 
              By restricting the capabilities of nanomanufacturing systems simultaneously 
              along multiple design dimensions such as control <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> (A1), 
              nutrition (E4), mobility (E10), immutability (L3, L4), etc. [19], 
              molecular manufacturing systems&#8212;whether microscale or macroscale&#8212;can 
              be made inherently safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Phoenix and Drexler [20] noted in a 2004 paper:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1959, <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> pointed out that nanometer-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
                could be built and operated, and that the precision inherent in 
                molecular construction would make it easy to build multiple identical 
                copies. This raised the possibility of exponential manufacturing, 
                in which production systems could rapidly and cheaply increase 
                their productive capacity, which in turn suggested the possibility 
                of destructive runaway self-replication. Early proposals for artificial 
                nanomachinery focused on small self-replicating machines, discussing 
                their potential <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> and their potential destructiveness 
                if abused.... [But] nanotechnology-based fabrication can be thoroughly 
                non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and inherently safe: such systems need have no 
                ability to move about, use natural resources, or undergo incremental 
                mutation. Moreover, self-replication is unnecessary: the development 
                and use of highly productive systems of nanomachinery (nanofactories) 
                need not involve the construction of autonomous self-replicating 
                nanomachines.... Although advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies could (with 
                great difficulty and little incentive) be used to build such devices, 
                other concerns present greater problems. Since weapon systems 
                will be both easier to build and more likely to draw investment, 
                the potential for dangerous systems is best considered in the 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of military competition and arms control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it must be conceded that while nanotechnology-based 
              manufacturing systems can be made safe, they also could be made 
              dangerous. Just because free-range self-replicators may be "undesirable, 
              inefficient and unnecessary" [20] does not imply that they cannot 
              be built, or that nobody will build them. How can we avoid "throwing 
              out the baby with the bathwater"? The correct solution, first explicitly 
              proposed by Freitas in 2000 [21] and later partially echoed by Phoenix 
              and Drexler in 2004, [22] starts with a carefully targeted moratorium 
              or outright legal ban on the most dangerous kinds of nanomanufacturing 
              systems, while still allowing the safe kinds of nanomanufacturing 
              systems to be built&#8212;subject to appropriate monitoring and regulation 
              commensurate with the lesser risk that they pose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Virtually every known technology comes in "safe" and "dangerous" 
              flavors which necessarily must receive different legal treatment. 
              For example, over-the-counter drugs are the safest and most difficult 
              to abuse, hence are lightly regulated; prescription drugs, more 
              easy to abuse, are very heavily regulated; and other drugs, typically 
              addictive narcotics and other recreational substances, are legally 
              banned from use by anyone, even for medicinal purposes. Artificial 
              chemicals can range from lightly regulated household substances 
              such as Clorox or ammonia; to more heavily regulated compounds such 
              as pesticides, solvents and acids; to the most dangerous chemicals 
              such as chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a> agents which are banned outright by international 
              treaties. Another example is pyrotechnics, which range from highway 
              flares, which are safe enough to be purchased and used by anyone; 
              to "safe and sane" fireworks, which are lightly regulated but still 
              available to all; to moderately-regulated firecrackers and model 
              rocketry; to minor explosives and skyrockets, which in most states 
              can be legally obtained and used only by licensed professionals 
              who are heavily regulated; to high-yield plastic explosives, which 
              are legally <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible only to military specialists; to nuclear 
              explosives, the possession of which is strictly limited to a handful 
              of nations via international treaties, enforced by an international 
              inspection agency. Yet another example is aeronautics technology, 
              which ranges from safe unregulated kites and paper airplanes; to 
              lightly regulated powered model airplanes operated by remote control; 
              to moderately regulated civilian aircraft, both small and large; 
              to heavily regulated military attack aircraft such as jet fighters 
              and bombers, which can only be purchased by approved governments; 
              to intercontinental ballistic missiles, the possession of which 
              is strictly limited to a handful of nations via international treaties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that in all cases, the existence of a "safe" version of a 
              technology does not preclude the existence of a "dangerous" version, 
              and vice versa. The laws of physics permit both versions to exist. 
              The most rational societal response has been to classify the various 
              applications according to the risk of accident or abuse that each 
              one poses, and then to regulate each application accordingly. The 
              societal response to the tools and products of molecular manufacturing 
              will be no different. Some MM-based tools and products will be deemed 
              safe, and will be lightly regulated. Other MM-based tools and products 
              will be deemed dangerous, and will be heavily regulated, or even 
              legally banned in some cases.</p>

<p>Of course, the mere existence of legal restrictions or outright 
              bans does not preclude the acquisition and abuse of a particular 
              technology by a small criminal fraction of the population. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, 
              in the high-risk category, drug abusers obtain and inject themselves 
              with banned narcotics; outlaw regimes employ prohibited poison chemicals 
              in warfare; and rogue nations seek to enter the "nuclear club" via 
              clandestine atomic bomb development <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Bad actors such as 
              terrorists can also abuse less-heavily regulated products such as 
              fully-automatic rifles or civilian airplanes (which are hijacked 
              and flown into buildings). The most constructive response to this 
              class of threat is to increase monitoring efforts to improve early 
              detection and to pre-position defensive <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>alities capable 
              of responding rapidly to these abuses, as recommended in 2000 by 
              this author [4] in the context of molecular manufacturing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The risk of accident or malfunction is less problematic for new 
              technologies than the dangers of abuse. Engineers generally try 
              to design products that work reliably and companies generally seek 
              to sell reliable products to maintain customer goodwill and to avoid 
              expensive product liability lawsuits. But accidents do happen. Here 
              again, our social system has established a set of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ive responses 
              to deal efficiently with this problem. A good example is the ancient 
              technology of fire. The uses of fire are widespread in <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, 
              ranging from lightly-regulated matchsticks, butane lighters, campfires, 
              and internal combustion engines, to more heavily regulated home 
              HVAC furnaces, municipal incinerators and industrial smelters. A 
              range of <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s are available to deal quickly and effectively with 
              a fire that has accidentally escaped the control of its user. Home 
              fires due to a smoldering cigarette or a blazing grease pan in the 
              kitchen are readily doused using a common household fire extinguisher. 
              Fires in commercial buildings (e.g., hotels) or industrial buildings 
              (e.g., factories) are automatically quenched by overhead sprinkler 
              systems. When these methods prove insufficient to snuff out the 
              flames, the local fire department is called in to limit the damage 
              to just a single building, using fire trucks, water hoses and hydrants. 
              If many buildings are involved, more extensive fire suppression 
              equipment and hundreds of firefighters can be brought in from all 
              across town to hold the damage to a single city block. In the case 
              of the largest accidental fires, like forest fires, vast quantities 
              of heavy equipment are deployed including thousands of firefighters 
              wielding specialized tools, bulldozers to dig firebreaks, helicopters 
              with pendulous water buckets, and great fleets of air tankers dropping 
              tons of fire retardants. (These progressive measures also protect 
              the public in cases of deliberate arson.) The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> emergency response 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> for dealing with MM-based accidents will be no less exhaustive 
              and may be equally effective in preserving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and property, 
              while allowing us to enjoy the innumerable benefits of this new 
              technology. Notes Steen Rasmussen of Los Alamos National Laboratory 
              in New Mexico: "The more powerful technology you unleash, the more 
              careful you have to be." [23]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The study of the ethical [24], socioeconomic [25-28] and legal 
              [29] impact of replication-capable machines such as molecular assemblers 
              and machines such as nanofactories that could build replicators 
              is still in its earliest stages, and there is additional discussion 
              of safety issues elsewhere [30]. However, two important general 
              observations about replicators and self-replication should be noted 
              here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, <b>replication is nothing new</b>. Humanity has thousands, 
              arguably even millions, of years of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> living with entities 
              that are capable of kinematic self-replication. These replicators 
              range from the macroscale (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, birds, horses, other humans) 
              on down to the microscale (e.g. bacteria, protozoa) and even the 
              nanoscale (e.g., prions, viruses). As a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, we have successfully 
              managed the eternal tradeoff between risk and reward, and have successfully 
              negotiated the antipodes of danger and progress. There is every 
              reason to expect this success to continue. (As shown by the problem 
              of invasive species, the biosphere requires time to adapt to new 
              replicators, so human intervention may be required to prevent severe 
              damage.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The technologies of engineered self-replication, even at the microscale, 
              are already in wide commercial use throughout the world. Indeed, 
              human <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is utterly dependent on self-replication technologies. 
              Many important foods including beer, wine, cheese, yogurt, and kefir 
              (a fermented milk), along with various flavors, nutrients, vitamins 
              and other food ingredients, are produced by specially cultured microscopic 
              replicators such as algae, fungi (yeasts) and bacteria. Virtually 
              all of the rest of our food is made by macroscale replicators such 
              as agricultural crop plants, trees, and farm <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. Many of our 
              most important drugs are produced using microscopic self-replicators&#8212;from 
              penicillin produced by natural replicating molds starting in the 
              1940s [15] to the first use of artificial (engineered) self-replicating 
              bacteria to manufacture human insulin by Eli Lilly in 1982 [31]. 
              These uses continue today in the manufacture of many other important 
              drug products such as: (a) human <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> hormone (HGH) and erythropoietin 
              (EPO), (b) precursors for <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s such as erythromycin [32], 
              and (<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">c</a>) therapeutic <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s such as Factor VIII. A few species 
              of self-replicating bacteria are even used directly as therapeutic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>s, such as the widely available swallowable pills containing 
              bacteria (i.e., natural biological nanomachines) for gastrointestinal 
              refloration, as for example Salivarex<sup>TM</sup> which "contains 
              a minimum of 2.9 billion beneficial bacteria per capsule" [33], 
              and Alkadophilus<sup>TM</sup> which "contains 1.5 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s 
              per capsule" [34], both at a 2005 price of ~$(0.1-0.2) x 10<sup>-9</sup> 
              per microscale replicator (i.e., per bacterium). Some replicating 
              viruses, notably <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteriophage_entry.html">bacteriophage</a>s, are used as therapeutic agents 
              to combat and destroy unhealthful infectious bacterial replicators 
              [35], and for decades viruses have served as transfer vectors to 
              attempt gene therapies [36]. In industry, bacteria are already employed 
              as "self-replicating factories" [37] for various useful products, 
              and microorganisms are also used as workhorses for environmental 
              bioremediation [38, 39], biomining of heavy metals [40], and other 
              applications. In due course, we will learn to safely harness the 
              abilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> replication-capable machines for human 
              benefit as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second, <b>replicators can be made inherently safe</b>. An "inherently 
              safe" kinematic replicator is a replicating system that, by its 
              very design, is inherently incapable of surviving mutation or of 
              undergoing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> (and thus evolving out of our control or developing 
              an independent agenda), and that, equally importantly, does not 
              compete with <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> for resources (or worse, use biology as a raw 
              materials resource [4]). One primary route for ensuring inherent 
              safety is to combine the <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> for control [41] 
              and the vitamin architecture for materials [42], which together 
              eliminate the likelihood that the system can replicate outside of 
              a very controlled and highly artificial setting. There are numerous 
              other routes to this end [10, 19]. Many dozens of additional safeguards 
              may be incorporated into replicator designs to provide redundant 
              embedded controls and thus an arbitrarily low probability of replicator 
              malfunctions of various kinds, simply by selecting the appropriate 
              design <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s [19].</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Artificial kinematic replication-capable systems which are not 
              inherently safe should not be designed or constructed, and indeed 
              should be legally prohibited by appropriate juridical and economic 
              sanctions, with these sanctions to be enforced in both national 
              and international regimes. In the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> lawbreakers 
              or rogue states that might build and deploy unsafe artificial mechanical 
              replicators, the defenses we have already developed against harmful 
              biological replicators all have <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>s in the mechanical world 
              that should provide equally effective, or even superior, defenses. 
              Molecular manufacturing will make possible ever more sophisticated 
              methods of environmental monitoring, prophylaxis and safety. However, 
              advance planning and strategic foresight will be essential in maintaining 
              this advantage.</p>

<p>11. According to cyberjournalist Clive Thompson [43], elite writers 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses openly publish their <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> on Web sites, often 
              with detailed descriptions of how the program works, but don't actually 
              release them. The people who do release the viruses are often anonymous 
              mischief-makers, or "script kiddies"&#8212;a derisive term 
              for aspiring young <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s, "usually teenagers or curious college 
              students, who don't yet have the skill to program computers but 
              like to pretend they do. They <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> the viruses, claim to have 
              written them themselves and then set them free in an attempt to 
              assume the role of a fearsome <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> menace. Script kiddies often 
              have only a dim idea of how the code works and little concern for 
              how a digital plague can rage out of control. Our modern <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> epidemic 
              is thus born of a symbiotic relationship between the people smart 
              enough to write a virus and the people dumb enough&#8212;or malicious 
              enough&#8212;to spread it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thompson goes on to describe his early 2004 visit to an Austrian 
              programmer named Mario, who cheerfully announced that in 2003 he 
              had created, and placed online at his website, freely available, 
              a program called "Batch Trojan Generator" that autogenerates 
              malicious viruses. Thompson described a demonstration of this program: 
              "A little box appears on his laptop screen, politely asking 
              me to name my Trojan. I call it the 'Clive' virus. Then it asks 
              me what I'd like the virus to do. Shall the Trojan Horse format 
              drive C:? Yes, I click. Shall the Trojan Horse overwrite every file? 
              Yes. It asks me if I'd like to have the virus activate the next 
              time the computer is restarted, and I say yes again. Then it's done. 
              The generator spits out the virus onto Mario's hard drive, a tiny 
              3KB file. Mario's generator also displays a stern notice warning 
              that spreading your creation is illegal. The generator, he says, 
              is just for <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al purposes, a way to help curious programmers 
              learn how Trojans work. But of course I could ignore that advice."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apparently top "malware" writers do take some responsible 
              precautions, notes Thompson. For example, one hacker's "main 
              virus-writing computer at home has no <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> connection at all; 
              he has walled it off like an airlocked biological-weapons lab, so 
              that nothing can escape, even by accident." Some writers, after 
              finishing a new virus, "immediately e-mail a copy of it to 
              antivirus companies so the companies can program their software 
              to recognize and delete the virus should some script kiddie ever 
              release it into the wild."</p>

<p>38. According to Press [44]: "The first <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>ed form of life produced 
              by genetic engineering was a greatly enhanced oil-eating microbe. 
              The patent [45] was registered to Dr. Ananda Chakrabarty of the 
              General Electric Company in 1981 and was initially welcomed as an 
              answer to the world's petroleum pollution problem. But anxieties 
              about releasing 'mutant bacteria' soon led the U.S. Congress and 
              the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prohibit the use of 
              genetically engineered microbes outside of sealed laboratories. 
              The prohibition set back bioremediation for a few years, until scientists 
              developed improved forms of oil-eating bacteria without using genetic 
              engineering. After large-scale field tests in 1988, the EPA reported 
              that bioremediation eliminated both soil and water-borne oil contamination 
              at about one-fifth the cost of previous methods. Since then, bioremediation 
              has been increasingly used to clean up oil pollution on government 
              sites across the United States."</p>
