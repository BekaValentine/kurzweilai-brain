<div class="TeaserText">John Brockman, editor of Edge.org, recently interviewed Ray Kurzweil on the Singularity and its ramifications.  According to Ray, "We are entering a new era. I call it 'the Singularity.' It's a merger between human intelligence and machine intelligence that is going to create something bigger than itself. It's the cutting edge of evolution on our planet. One can make a strong case that it's actually the cutting edge of the evolution of intelligence in general, because there's no indication that it's occurred anywhere else. To me that is what human civilization is all about. It is part of our destiny and part of the destiny of evolution to continue to progress ever faster, and to grow the power of intelligence exponentially.  To contemplate stopping that--to think human beings are fine the way they are--is a misplaced fond remembrance of what human beings used to be. What human beings are is a species that has undergone a cultural and technological evolution, and it's the nature of evolution that it accelerates, and that its powers grow exponentially, and that's what we're talking about. The next stage of this will be to amplify our own intellectual powers with the results of our technology."</div>

<p><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">RAY KURZWEIL</a>: My interest in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> really stems from my interest 
              in being an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>. I've had the idea of being an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> since 
              I was five years old, and I quickly realized that you had to have 
              a good idea of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> if you're going to succeed as an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>. 
              It's a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> like surfing; you have to catch a <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> at the 
              right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. I quickly realized the world quickly becomes a different 
              place than it was when you started by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you finally get something 
              done. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>s fail not because they can't get something to 
              work, but because all the market's enabling forces are not in place 
              at the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>So I became a student of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends, and have developed 
              mathematical models about how <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> evolves in different areas 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s in general, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> storage <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> technologies like genetic scanning, <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and 
              the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s. This helped guide me as an <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> 
              and as a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> creator so that I could catch the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> at the 
              right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>This interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends took on a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of its own, and 
              I began to project some of them using what I call the law of accelerating 
              returns, which I believe underlies <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              periods. I did that in a book I wrote in the 1980s, which had a 
              road map of what the 1990s and the early 2000's would be like, and 
              that worked out quite well. I've now refined these mathematical 
              models, and have begun to really examine what the 21st century would 
              be like. It allows me to be inventive with the technologies of the 
              21st century, because I have a <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of what <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, 
              the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will 
              be like in 2010, 2020, or 2030. If I can come up with scenarios 
              using those technologies, I can be inventive with the technologies 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. I can't actually create these technologies yet, but 
              I can write about them.</p>
<p>One thing I'd say is that if anything the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will be more remarkable 
              than any of us can imagine, because although any of us can only 
              apply so much <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>, there'll be thousands or millions of 
              people using their <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>s to create new capabilities with 
              these <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> powers. I've come to a view of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              that really doesn't stem from a preconceived notion, but really 
              falls out of these models, which I believe are valid both for theoretical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s and because they also match the empirical <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> of the 20th 
              century. </p>
<p>One thing that observers don't fully recognize, and that a lot 
              of otherwise <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful people fail to take into consideration adequately, 
              is the fact that the pace of change itself has accelerated. Centuries 
              ago people didn't think that the world was changing at all. Their 
              grandparents had the same lives that they did, and they expected 
              their grandchildren would do the same, and that expectation was 
              largely fulfilled. </p>
<p>Today it's an axiom that <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is changing and that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is 
              affecting the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. But what's not fully understood 
              is that the pace of change is itself accelerating, and the last 
              20 years are not a good guide to the next 20 years. We're doubling 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rate, the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, every decade. So 
              this will actually match the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> we made in the whole 
              20th century, because we've been accelerating up to this point. 
              The 20th century was like 25 years of change at today's rate of 
              change. In the next 25 years we'll make four times the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              you saw in the 20th century. And we'll make 20,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in the 21st century, which is almost a thousand times more technical 
              change than we saw in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is growing exponentially. The one exponential 
              trend that people are aware of is called <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. But Moore's 
              Law itself is just one <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> for bringing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. People are aware that we're doubling the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
              every 12 months because we can put twice as many <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> every two years. But in fact, they run twice 
              as fast and double both the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> and the speed, which means 
              that the power quadruples. </p>
<p>What's not fully realized is that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> was not the first 
              but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to bring <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              We had electro-mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, relay-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> 
              tubes, and <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> one <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> ran out of steam 
              another took over. For a while there were shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, 
              and finally they couldn't make them any smaller and still keep the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, so a whole different <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> came along. They weren't just 
              tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, but <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, which constitute a whole different 
              approach. There's been a lot of discussion about <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> running 
              out of steam in about 12 years because by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s 
              will only be a few atoms in width and we won't be able to shrink 
              them any more. And that's true, so that particular <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> will 
              run out of steam.</p>
<p>We'll then go to the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, which is massively parallel 
              computing in three dimensions. We live in a 3-dimensional world, 
              and our brains organize in three dimensions, so we might as well 
              compute in three dimensions. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> using 
              an electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that's ten million times slower than <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. 
              But it makes up for this by being three-dimensional. Every intra-neural 
              connection computes simultaneously, so you have a hundred trillion 
              things going on at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. And that's the direction we're 
              going to go in. Right now, chips, even though they're very dense, 
              are flat. Fifteen or twenty years from now <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will be massively 
              parallel and will be based on <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired models, which 
              we will devise largely by understanding how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works. </p>
<p>We're already being significantly influenced by it. It's generally 
              recognized, or at least accepted by a lot of observers, that we'll 
              have the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> to manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> within a brief 
              period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> - I'd say about twenty years. A thousand dollars 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> will equal the 20 million billion calculations per 
              second of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. What's more controversial is whether 
              or not we will have the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. People acknowledge that we'll 
              have very fast <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that could in theory emulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, but we don't really know how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works, and we won't 
              have the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, or the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Without this you just have an extremely fast 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>. </p>
<p>But our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works is also growing exponentially. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not of infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. It's a very complex <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, 
              and we're not going to achieve a total understanding through one 
              simple breakthrough, but we're further along in understanding the 
              principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> than most people realize. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is growing exponentially, 
              our ability to actually see the internal connection <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s is 
              growing, and we're developing more and more detailed mathematical 
              models of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. We actually have very detailed mathematical 
              models of several dozen regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and how they 
              work, and have recreated their <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies using conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. The results of those re-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered or re-<a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed 
              synthetic models of those <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions match the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> very 
              closely.</p>
<p>We're also literally replacing sections of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that are degraded 
              or don't work any more because of disabilities or <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. There 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s for <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's Disease</a> and well-known cochlear 
              implants for deafness. There's a new generation of those that are 
              coming out now that provide a thousand points of frequency resolution 
              and will allow deaf people to hear <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The 
              Parkinson's implant actually replaces the cortical <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s themselves 
              that are destroyed by that <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. So we've shown that it's feasible 
              to understand regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and reimplement those 
              regions in conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> that will actually 
              interact with the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and perform those functions. </p>
<p>If you follow this work and work out the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> of it. It's 
              a conservative scenario to say that within 30 years - possibly much 
              sooner - we will have a complete map of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, we will 
              have complete mathematical models of how each region works, and 
              we will be able to re-<a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              which are quite different than many of the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s used in contemporary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. </p>
<p>But these are actually similar to <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s that I use in my own 
              field - <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> - which is the fundamental capability 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. We can't think fast enough to logically analyze 
              situations very quickly, so we rely on our powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. 
              Within 30 years we'll be able to create non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              that's comparable to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Just like a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, we'll have to provide it an <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, but here we can bring 
              to bear some of the advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s 
              are much faster, and much more accurate. A thousand-dollar <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              can remember billions of things accurately - we're hard-pressed 
              to remember a handful of phone <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s. </p>
<p>Once they learn something, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can also share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              with other <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. We don't have quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports at the 
              level of our intra-<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al connection <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s and our concentrations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s, so we can't just <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. I can't 
              just take my <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of French and <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> it to you, but <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              can. So we can educate <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s through a process that can be hundreds 
              or thousands of times faster than the comparable process in humans. 
              It can provide a 20-year <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in maybe 
              a few weeks or a few days and then these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can share their 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>The primary implication of all this will be to enhance our own 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We're going to be putting these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s inside 
              our own brains. We're starting to do that now with people who have 
              severe medical problems and disabilities, but ultimately we'll all 
              be doing this. Without surgery, we'll be able to introduce calculating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s into the blood stream that will be able to pass through 
              the capillaries of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. These intelligent, blood-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-sized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will actually be able to go to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and interact with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> feasibility of this has already been 
              demonstrated in <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s.</p>
<p>One application of sending billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s into the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              is full-immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. If you want to be in real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s sit there and do nothing, but if you want to go into 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s shut down the signals coming from 
              my real senses, replace them with the signals I would be receiving 
              if I were in the virtual environment, and then my <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> feels as 
              if it's in the virtual environment. And you can go there yourself 
              - or, more interestingly you can go there with other people - and 
              you can have everything from sexual and sensual encounters to business 
              negotiations, in full-immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments that 
              incorporate all of the senses. </p>
<p>People will beam their own flow of sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s and the 
              neurological correlates of their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s out into the Web, the 
              way people now beam images from web cams in their living rooms and 
              bedrooms. This will enable you to plug in and actually <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              what it's like to be someone else, including their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al reactions, 
              a&#180; la the plot <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of Being John Malkovich. In virtual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> you don't have to be the same person. You can be someone 
              else, and can project yourself as a different person.</p>
<p>Most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, we'll be able to enhance our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              with non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> through intimate connections. This 
              won't mean just having one thin pipe between the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and a non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, but actually having non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in billions 
              of different places in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. I don't know about you, but there 
              are lots of books I'd like to read and Web sites I'd like to go 
              to, and I find my <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> limiting. So instead of having a mere 
              hundred trillion connections, we'll have a hundred trillion times 
              a million. We'll be able to enhance our cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> 
              capabilities greatly, think faster, and <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. </p>
<p>If you follow these trends further, you get to a point where change 
              is happening so rapidly that there appears to be a rupture in the 
              fabric of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. Some people have referred to this as the 
              "Singularity." There are many different definitions of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>, a term borrowed from <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, which means an actual 
              point of infinite density and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that's kind of a rupture in 
              the fabric of <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a>. </p>
<p>Here, that <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> is applied by <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, where 
              we see a point where this rate of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> will be 
              so rapid that it appears to be a rupture in the fabric of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. It's impossible in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> to see beyond a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>, 
              which creates an <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> boundary, and some people have hypothesized 
              that it will be impossible to characterize <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> after the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. My question is, what will <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> be like after 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>, which I predict will occur somewhere right before 
              the middle of the 21st century?</p>
<p>A lot of the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s we have of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> - such 
              as longevity - suggest a limited capability as <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              entities. All of these <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s are going to undergo significant 
              change as we basically <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. It's taken me 
              a while to get my own mental arms around these issues. In the book 
              I wrote in the 1980s, The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a>, I ended with 
              the specter of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s matching <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> somewhere between 
              2020 and 2050, and I basically have not changed my view on that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> frame, although I left behind my view that this is a final 
              specter. In the book I wrote ten years later, The Age of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s, I began to consider what <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> would be like past the point 
              where <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could compete with us. Now I'm trying to consider 
              what that will mean for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that we should keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> is that innate <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is fixed. We have 1026 calculations per second in the 
              whole <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race and there are ten billion <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds. Fifty years 
              from now, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of humanity will still be 
              at that same <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of magnitude. On the other hand, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is growing exponentially, and today it's a million times less than 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> figure. So although it still seems that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is dominating, which it is, the crossover point is around 2030 and 
              non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will continue its exponential rise.</p>
<p><b>EDGE: This reminds me of a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> I once had with John 
              Lilly about dolphins. I asked him, "How do you know they're 
              more intelligent than we are?" Isn't <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> tautological? 
              How can we know more than we do know? Who would know it, except 
              us?</b></p>
<p>KURZWEIL: That's actually a very good point, because one response 
              is not to want to be enhanced, not to have <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s. A lot of people 
              say that they just want to stay a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> person. But what will 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> look like to people who want to remain <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>? 
              The answer is that they really won't notice it, except for the fact 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will appear to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humanity to 
              be their transcendent servants. It will appear that these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              are very friendly are taking care of all of our needs, and are really 
              our transcendent servants. But providing that service of meeting 
              all of the material and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al needs of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humanity will 
              comprise a very tiny fraction of the mental output of the non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. So there's a lot that, in fact, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              humanity won't actually notice.</p>
<p>There are two levels of consideration here. On the economic level, 
              mental output will be the primary criterion. We're already getting 
              close to the point that the only thing that has value is <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> has value to the extent that it really reflects <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, 
              not just raw <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. There are a few products on this table - a clock, 
              a camera, tape recorder - that are physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, but really 
              the value of them is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that went into their design: 
              the design of their chips and the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that's used to invent 
              and manufacture them. The actual raw materials - a bunch of sand 
              and some metals and so on - is worth a few pennies, but these products 
              have value because of all the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that went into creating 
              them.</p>
<p>And the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of products and services is asymptoting 
              towards 100 percent. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we get to 2030 it will be basically 
              100 percent. With a combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, we'll be able to create virtually any physical product 
              and meet all of our material needs. When everything is <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, it'll be a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of just <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing the right 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, and we're already getting pretty close to that.</p>
<p>On a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual level, the issue of what is <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is another 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant aspect of this, because we will have entities by 2030 
              that seem to be conscious, and that will claim to have feelings. 
              We have entities today, like characters in your kids' <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a>s, 
              that can make that claim, but they are not very convincing. If you 
              run into a character in a <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a> and it talks about its feelings, 
              you know it's just a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> simulation; you're not convinced that 
              it's a real person there. This is because that <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, which is 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, is still a million times simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>In 2030, that won't be the case. Say you encounter another person 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> that looks just like a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> but there's actually 
              no <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behind it - it's completely an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> projecting 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like figure in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, or even a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like image 
              in real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> using an <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a> robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. These entities 
              will seem <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. They won't be a million times simpler than humans. 
              They'll be as complex as humans. They'll have all the subtle cues 
              of being humans. They'll be able to sit here and be interviewed 
              and be just as convincing as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, just as complex, just as interesting. 
              And when they claim to have been angry or happy it'll be just as 
              convincing as when another <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> makes those claims.</p>
<p>At this point, it becomes a really deeply philosophical issue. 
              Is that just a very clever simulation that's good enough to trick 
              you, or is it really conscious in the way that we assume other people 
              are? In my view there's no real way to test that scientifically. 
              There's no <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> you can slide the <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> into where a green <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> 
              goes on and says okay, this <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>'s conscious, but no, this one's 
              not. You could make a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, but it will have philosophical assumptions 
              built into it. Some philosophers will say that unless it's squirting 
              impulses through <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s, it's not conscious, 
              or that unless it's a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> with a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mother 
              and father it's not conscious. But it becomes a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of philosophical 
              debate. It's not scientifically resolvable.</p>
<p>The next big revolution that's going to affect us right away is 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, because we've merged <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing. We are in the early stages of understanding 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> processes and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> processes by understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              and how the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> expresses itself in <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. And we're going 
              to find - and this has been apparent all along - that there's a 
              slippery slope and no clear definition of where <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> begins. Both 
              sides of the abortion debate have been afraid to get off the edges 
              of that debate: that <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> starts at <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion on the one hand or 
              it starts literally at birth on the other. They don't want to get 
              off those edges, because they realize it's just a completely slippery 
              slope from one end to the other.</p>
<p>But we're going to make it even more slippery. We'll be able to 
              create <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s without ever actually going through the fertilized 
              egg. What's the difference between a skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, which has all the 
              genes, and a fertilized egg? The only differences are some <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s 
              in the eggs and some signaling factors that we don't fully understand, 
              yet that are basically <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. We will get to the point where 
              we'll be able to take some <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> mix, which is just a bunch of 
              chemicals and clearly not a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being, and add it to a skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              to create a fertilized egg that we can then immediately differentiate 
              into any <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> of the body. When I go like this and brush off thousands 
              of skin cells, I will be destroying thousands of potential people. 
              There's not going to be any clear boundary. </p>
<p>This is another way of saying also that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              are going to find a way around the controversy. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, we'll 
              be able to do therapeutic cloning, which is a very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              that completely avoids the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the fetus. We'll be able to 
              take skin cells and create, pretty directly without ever going through 
              a fetus, all the cells we need.</p>
<p>We're not that far away from being able to create new cells. For 
              example, I'm 53 but with my <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, I'll be able to create the heart 
              cells of a 25-year-old man, and I can replace my heart with those 
              cells without surgery just by sending them through my blood stream. 
              They'll take up residence in the heart, so at first I'll have a 
              heart that's one percent young cells and 99 percent older ones. 
              But if I keep doing this every day, a year later, my heart is 99 
              percent young cells. With that kind of therapy we can ultimately 
              replenish all the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> tissues and the organs in the body. This 
              is not something that will happen tomorrow, but these are the kinds 
              of revolutionary processes we're on the verge of.</p>
<p>If you look at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> longevity - which is another one of these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s - you'll notice that we added a few days every 
              year to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy in the 18th century. In the 19th 
              century we added a few weeks every year, and now we're now adding 
              over a hundred days a year, through all of these developments, which 
              are going to continue to accelerate. Many <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able observers, 
              including myself, feel that within ten years we'll be adding more 
              than a year every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy. </p>
<p>As we get older, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy will actually move out at 
              a faster rate than we're actually <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ing in age, so if we can 
              hang in there, our generation is right on the edge. We have to watch 
              our health the old-fashioned way for a while longer so we're not 
              the last generation to die prematurely. But if you look at our kids, 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> they're 20, 30, 40 years old, these technologies will 
              be so advanced that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy will be pushed way out.</p>
<p>There is also the more fundamental issue of whether or not ethical 
              debates are going to stop the developments that I'm talking about. 
              It's all very good to have these mathematical models and these trends, 
              but the question is if they going to hit a wall because people, 
              for one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> or another - through war or ethical debates such 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> issue controversy - thwart this ongoing exponential 
              development. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that's not the case. These ethical debates are 
              like stones in a stream. The water runs around them. You haven't 
              seen any of these <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> technologies held up for one week by 
              any of these debates. To some extent, they may have to find some 
              other ways around some of the limitations, but there are so many 
              developments going on. There are dozens of very exciting ideas about 
              how to use genomic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and proteomic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Although 
              the controversies may attach themselves to one idea here or there, 
              there's such a river of advances. The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of technological advance 
              is so deeply ingrained in our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> that it's an enormous imperative. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> has gotten around - correctly - talking about the dangers, 
              and I agree that the dangers are there, but you can't stop ongoing 
              development.</p>
<p>The kinds of scenarios I'm talking about 20 or 30 years from now 
              are not being developed because there's one laboratory that's sitting 
              there creating a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. They're 
              happening because it's the inevitable end result of thousands of 
              little steps. Each little step is conservative, not radical, and 
              makes perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. Each one is just the next generation of some 
              company's products. If you take thousands of those little steps 
              - which are getting faster and faster - you end up with some remarkable 
              changes 10, 20, or 30 years from now. You don't see <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a> 
              saying the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> implication of these technologies is so dangerous 
              that they're going to stop creating more intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s and 
              more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Sun can't do that. No company can do that 
              because it would be out of business. There's enormous economic imperative.</p>
<p>There is also a tremendous moral imperative. We still have not 
              millions but billions of people who are suffering from <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, and we have the opportunity to overcome those problems 
              through these technological advances. You can't tell the millions 
              of people who are suffering from <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> that we're really on the 
              verge of great breakthroughs that will save millions of lives from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, but we're canceling all that because the terrorists might 
              use that same <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to create a bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>. </p>
<p>This is a true and valid concern, but we're not going to do that. 
              There's a tremendous belief in <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> in the benefits of continued 
              economic and technological advance. Still, it does raise the question 
              of the dangers of these technologies, and we can talk about that 
              as well, because that's also a valid concern.</p>
<p>Another aspect of all of these changes is that they force us to 
              re-evaluate our <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of what it means to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. There is a 
              common viewpoint that reacts against the advance of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and 
              its implications for humanity. The <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion goes like this: we'll 
              have very powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s but we haven't solved the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              problem. And because the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>'s so incredibly complex, we can't 
              manage it.</p>
<p>I address this <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion by saying that the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> required to 
              emulate <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is actually not beyond our current capability. 
              We have to use different techniques - different self-organizing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s - that are <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is complicated 
              but it's not that complicated. You have to keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that it 
              is characterized by a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> of only 23 million bytes. The <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              is six billion bits - that's eight hundred million bytes - and there 
              are massive redundancies. One pretty long sequence called <a class="thought" href="entries/alu_entry.html">ALU</a> is 
              repeated 300 thousand times. If you use conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> compression 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s (at 23 million bytes, a small fraction of the size 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word), it's a level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that we can handle. 
              But we don't have that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> yet.</p>
<p>You might wonder how something with 23 million bytes can create 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that's a million times more complicated than itself. 
              That's not hard to understand. The <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> creates a process of wiring 
              a region of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> involving a lot of randomness. Then, 
              when the fetus becomes a baby and interacts with a very complicated 
              world, there's an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process within the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> in which 
              a lot of the connections die out, others get reinforced, and it 
              self-organizes to represent <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. It's a very 
              clever <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, and we don't understand it yet, but we will, because 
              it's not a level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> beyond what we're capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering.</p>
<p>In my view there is something special about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings that's 
              different from what we see in any of the other <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. By happenstance 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> we were the first <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> to be able to create <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. 
              Actually there were others, but we are the only one that survived 
              in this ecological niche. But we combined a rational faculty, the 
              ability to think logically, to create <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>s, to create models 
              of the world in our own minds, and to manipulate the world. We have 
              opposable thumbs so that we can create <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              is not just tools. Other <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s have used primitive tools, but 
              the difference is actually a body of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that changes and 
              evolves itself from generation to generation. The <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> has is another one of those <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s. 
            </p>
<p>We use one stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to create the next stage, which 
              is why <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> accelerates, why it grows in power. Today, for 
              example, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designer has these tremendously powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> design tools to create <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, so in a couple of days 
              they can create a very complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and it can all be worked out 
              very quickly. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designers had to actually draw 
              them all out in pen on paper. Each generation of tools creates the 
              power to create the next generation.</p>
<p>So <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> itself is an exponential, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process that 
              is a continuation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> that created humanity 
              in the first place. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> itself evolved in an exponential 
              manner. Each stage created more powerful tools for the next, so 
              when <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> created <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> it now had a means of keeping 
              records of its <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s so <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> could proceed more quickly. 
              Because of this, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion only lasted a few tens of 
              millions of years, whereas the first stage of creating <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and primitive 
              cells took billions of years. Finally, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> created 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that could manipulate its environment and had some rational 
              faculties, and now the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> actually changed 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> into something carried out by one of its 
              own creations, <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a>, and is represented by <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. In 
              the next epoch this <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that ushered in its own <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process - that is, its own cultural and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
              as no other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> has - will combine with its own creation and 
              will <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with its <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. At some level that's already happening, 
              even if most of us don't necessarily have them yet inside our bodies 
              and brains, since we're very intimate with the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-it's in 
              our pockets. We've certainly expanded the power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> through the power of its <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>We are entering a new era. I call it "the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>." 
              It's a merger between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              that is going to create something bigger than itself. It's the cutting 
              edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> on our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. One can make a strong case that 
              it's actually the cutting edge of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              in general, because there's no indication that it's occurred anywhere 
              else. To me that is what <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is all about. It is 
              part of our destiny and part of the destiny of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to continue 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> ever faster, and to grow the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> exponentially. 
              To contemplate stopping that - to think <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are fine the 
              way they are - is a misplaced fond remembrance of what <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings 
              used to be. What <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are is a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that has undergone 
              a cultural and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, and it's the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              that it accelerates, and that its powers grow exponentially, and 
              that's what we're talking about. The next stage of this will be 
              to amplify our own intellectual powers with the results of our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>What is unique about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings is our ability to create abstract 
              models and to use these mental models to understand the world and 
              do something about it. These mental models have become more and 
              more sophisticated, and by becoming embedded in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, they 
              have become very elaborate and very powerful. Now we can actually 
              understand our own minds. This ability to scale up the power of 
              our own <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is what's unique about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">Pattern</a>s are the fundamental ontological <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, because they 
              are what persists, not anything physical. Take myself, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>. 
              What is <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>? Is it this stuff here? Well, this stuff changes 
              very quickly. Some of our cells turn over in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of days. Even 
              our skeleton, which you think probably lasts forever because we 
              find skeletons that are centuries old, changes over within a year. 
              Many of our <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s change over. But more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s 
              making up the cells change over even more quickly, so even if a 
              particular <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> is still there the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s are different. So I'm 
              not the same stuff, the same collection of atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that 
              I was a year ago. </p>
<p>But what does persist is that <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> evolves slowly, 
              but the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> persists. So we're kind of like the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that 
              water makes in a stream; you put a rock in there and you'll see 
              a little <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. The water is changing every few milliseconds; 
              if you come a second later, it's completely different water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, 
              but the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> persists. <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">Pattern</a>s are what have resonance. Ideas 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. Even our <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> as 
              people is nothing but a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">Pattern recognition</a> is the heart 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Ninety-nine percent of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is 
              our ability to recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s.</p>
<p>There's been a sea change just in the last several years in the 
              public understanding of the acceleration of change and the potential 
              impact of all of these technologies - <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> - on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. There's really been tremendous 
              change in popular public <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> in the past three years because 
              of the onslaught of stories and news developments that document 
              and support this vision. There are now several stories every day 
              that are significant developments and that show the escalating power 
              of these technologies.</p>

Sometimes I need to BELIEVE!!!

I've been working on a replicator for a few years as a hobby, without using anticipated A.i.

BTW the implications of being able to replicate are pretty big.

One is, that with a probability of a several percents, we will have a huge disaster. Nuclear war, AIDS traveling with air .. something what will kill us before.
<br>
<br>
And there is another. That we will find some shortcuts, Ray hasn't mentioned. Shortcuts that will deliver the Singularity much sooner.

It _looks_ to me, that the probability for the later is ... almost granted. :)

<br>
<br>
Let me mention a few:
<br>
<br>
 - What if the brain scaning - Ray sees in 2030 - is not that demanding at all. Fredkin talks about some MRI (on this site also). What if this is doable today, with a 24 hour scaning and careful data combining? I wouldn't be very surprised.
<br>
<br>
 - What if quantum computers give us unprecedented computing power in 2010? I wouldn't be very surprised.
<br>
<br>
 - What if knowledge systematization is everything what intelligence is about. And if an efficient algorithm for doing this is devised and implemented on the net?
<br>
<br>
 - What if datamining is going to bring us the seed AI?
<br>
<br>
etc.. etc.. 
<br>
<br>
One of those is nearly bound to happen. IMO.

<br>
The pattern I've seen in climatology is that it seems to be run by positive feedback mechanisms. The only reason we can't really predict very well in climate science, is that as the earth heats up, it triggers these positive feedback mechanisms, which then trigger other positive feedback mechanisms that we couldn't have foreseen. Well, ya'll know the story, so I'll cut it short.
<br>
<br>
I see no reason that this isn't also happening with the Rate of Accelerating Returns, which puts the Singularity much closer.

<br>
<br>
You develop a human-equivilant machine intelligence software, run it on a supercomputer with human-equivilant speed (likely reachable around 2020), give it all the information it needs to engineer the next generation of microprocessors, and then set it to work.
<br>
<br>
While ve's working on the engineering, you and other humans set up the manufacturing facility to that ve can automatically change over all the production vimself without any human intervention.
<br>
<br>
In 12 months or so, after running for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ve will have engineered a processor twice as fast as the one's ve's running on.  You power vim down, and replace each of the chips he's running on with one of the new chips, fire vim back up, and ve goes back to work.
<br>
<br>
Ve is now running TWICE as fast as previous.  This allows vim to develop the NEXT generation of processors within - 6 months!  Or, ve could allocate 50% of vis processor threads to the next-gen processor design, and the other 50% towards developing a better memory and motherboard architecture, in the same amount of time as it took vim to develop the last job!
<br>
<br>
Within several years, you've got the Singularity, running on superprocessors with several embedded distinct microprocessors, hooked up to RAM with massive amounts of bandwidth and latency of nanoseconds.....well.  You've got Singularity.
<br>
<br>
Now all the engineers need to do is tell the Singularity to develop Nanotechnology, and you're a few years away from the entire world being utopian.  If, of course, that initial AI was based off Friendly AI.
<br>
<br>
And damnit, why isn't Friendly AI in Kurzweil's Brain?</p></td>

But, didn't mechanical devices change the whole of civilization? I am sure a modern car, a Boeing 747, or even a weed wacker would all seem quite magical to someone from the 18th, let alone 19th centuries.

I think your comment here only better proves Kurzweil's point, as it highlights the exponentially increasing knowledge and creativity, and hence advancement, of the human race.</p></td>

1.      Introductory Resources:  All of this is loose speculation based on a fully functional nanotechnological infrastructure, such as that envisioned by K. Eric Drexler, Ralph Merkle and others.  See Drexler's 'Nanosystems' and 'Engines of Creation' as well as Robert Freitas' 'Nanomedicine' series, as well as the following resources.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2.    Introduction: An active polymorphic, Utility-Fluid* nanotechnological substrate is loosely outlined which could be used to form a multi-scale object, matter/energy transportation, transformation sensor/effector system which could span the Earth, fill and extend the atmosphere and transform it into an active participant in near and sub-terrestrial events.  The Utility-Fluid system bears a behavioral macro-level resemblance to John Storrs Hall's (JoSH) "utility fog," (see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613230012/http://www.nanotech-now.com/utility-fog.htm)" target="_blank">http://www.nanotech-now.com/utility-fog.htm)</a> but the similarities between the two systems rapidly diminish at the unit level.  Rather, this system uses a "utility fluid" (UFL) model for its architecture as opposed to a gaseous or "utility fog" model, and it is possible that this would provide for a very different set of capabilities at the meso and macro levels. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.    Programmable Matter Units (PMU): The units in this Utility Fluid (UFL) system are similar in structure to vacuous single celled organisms  (e.g. amoebas, hydrae, and neurons).  The units themselves have a muscular, polymorphic membrane which can expand and contract and modulate their shape at the object surface and subsurface levels, thus imbuing the PMU and its surface detail, texture and properties with rich polymorphic capabilities.  When taken together, as a "fluid", the units can slip around each other in a controlled, continuous and fluid manner using sub-surface modulations.  these could include: 1. Adaptive Electro-Magnetic Levitation (AEML, to be discussed below), where the surfaces would actually be seperated some distance by magnetic levitation, similar to a gas; 2. Mechanical, 2a. Radial and/or rotary/circumferential movement of sub-surface sub-units and patternings.  2b. Utility Fog Emulation, the unit-surface can also form into radiating arms and thus the individual units can emulate JoSH's foglets in functionality if the necessity arises.  The space-filling, "fluid" mode, however, is a welcome alternative to the cumbersome hand-to-hand motion-transfer from unit to unit required by the JoSH method.
<br>
<br>
3.1.   Adaptive Electro-Magnetic Levitation (AEML) -==----==-   The polymorphic, surface modulating capabilities make the units necessarily much more complex than the jOSH model, but the basic inter-unit motion-control programming/protocol should be simpler and readily evolvable.  The embedded polymorphic, multi-scalar multi-hub, information/power switching network (see below) gives rise to many interesting possibilities.  Each fluid unit is a power-switching hub. Thus networks of these units would be able to form higher level adaptable electronic circuits and electricity flow patterns. A surface of densely packed collumns of ~500 microns in diameter, (50 or so units ) could form helical or coil circuits giving rise to a magnetic field.  The magnetic field formed from arrays of these AEML cells should be strong enough to provide magnetic levitation at the interface between the capsule and the surface of the muscular contraction. For larger systems the circuits could be formed at larger scales and more power could be drawn through the circuits to provide a more powerful magnetic field. ,(1/( ganglion of sperm brains1\10\1)
<br>
<br>
3.2.   NOTE: [::::::::  .depending upon the possible strength of an AEML cell in the sub-micron region, the units, expanded to space-filling shape, could produce the AEML cells on their surfaces required for levitation. The precise manipulation and synchronization of patterns of AEML fields at the cell-to-cell interfaces could produce the necessary laminar flow forces (electro-magnetic peristalsis) required to actuate a  laminar flow.  One could imagine many scenarios arising from this capability ... the units could join together to construct machinery for the transportation and launching of other units, aggregates or macroscale objects ....::::.::::.:]</p></td>

<br>
<br>
So they will have no job and relatively no opportunity, unless there is some sort of funnel from the world's rich to the world's poor, or the cost of the most advanced technology becomes real cheap. &lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
The fear that no one will have a job in the future is one that is understandable but I don't believe. Jobs have been are are being destroyed and created every day. As I said before, would you really want someone to have protected the horse and buggy industry? Times change. Technology gets better. There will always be jobs.
<br>
<br>
And it is true that technology always gets cheaper over time.
<br>
<br>
One point I've made a few times in other threads is that I don't believe it's a lack of money that is holding the poor areas of the world back. It's a lack of stable governments and freedom. Those are the prerequisites that allow nations and areas to grow economically. Stability and freedom. There would be massive investment in Africa, if investors weren't afraid (legitimately) that their investments wouldn't be carted off by some warlord or nationalized by a marxist regime.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>While I agree that technology always gets cheaper over time, and maybe it would get cheap enough to bring the world's poor to a level where they would no longer die of of malnutrition, dehydration, and starvation, I do not think it is simply a matter of political and economic stability that is keeping the poor countries down.
<br>
<br>
I think it has to do with capital flows into and out of there countries.  And given that foreign corporations will gradually outcompete local ones for their local markets, the question of exports vs. imports becomes even more critical.  
<br>
<br>
One of there major exports right now is there manual labor.  
<br>
<br>
Even if as many new jobs will be created as destroyed by the present technological revolution (which i definitely do not believe), they will be created at the high end and destroyed at the low end.  in other words many jobs that require creativity, education, and skill will be created while those involving manual labor will be destroyed.  This bodes very well for the U.S. and very badly for Africa and other developing nations who never got there fair chance at the world's economic pie.</p></td>

<br>
Why "a living utopia for the biologics"?  Seems that given such a thorough "transformation of the universe to information at light speed, or faster", the distinction between "biologic" and "ontologic" would breakdown entirely.  If there is any "sentience" remaining (if "sentience" even has value at such a stage of the universe) then there may be only "the one" sentience, universe.  Would that be "nice"?  Nice for who, or what?  What becomes "useful"?  What becomes "purpose"?
<br>
<br>
If "means" are always "the means to achieve an end", then this transformation is a better means, only in terms of a better end.  Is this end "better for the one, the universe"?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Convergence between machine and mind is very seductive. A machine works on principles of rules and logical execution. The mind works on the principles of inference based on memory and bayesian probabilities related to what is stored and recalled.
<br>
<br>
There is an overlap between both machine and mind. Mind 'rules' are degenerative in that memory is not a perfect vehicle for repetitive actions while computer memory is infallible until power is turned off.
<br>
<br>
The weakness in the machine is in its dependence on a holistic and reliable framework, whether device, protocol, network communication or software process. A failure in one or more renders the outcome as less than useful.
<br>
<br>
The weakness in the mind is its pliability; it becomes more useful when chemical and physiological mechanisms are reinforced (learning) but less reliable when asked to recall specific instances. 
<br>
<br>
For example, repetitive attacks on a machine can condition a response to learn from what the machine has to respond to. Whether it is a physical response, (light, temperature, shock, sound) or based on programmatic sequences (if this happened then this resulted, therefore...).
<br>
<br>
The mind works on multiple levels. for example, a fright or flight experience triggers multiple response events:
<br>
<br>
1. adrenaline pulses cause muscles and heart and blood flows to respond in nanoseconds.
<br>
<br>
2. visual inputs are detected at primitive levels such such as rod and cone patterns within the retina, as well as edge detection matching to remembered patterns that are recalled as images.
<br>
<br>
3. reasoning responses based on audio, visual and sensual inputs that indicate a positive/negative experience.
<br>
<br>
4. in situ memory so that one person's recall leads to different conclusions than someone else with the same stimulus.
<br>
<br>
To infer that there is a singularity between man and machine is specious only in that the order of the experiment is wrong. Rather, one should look at how the mind can be conditioned by what we produce as systems that 'mimic' processes that are either tedious or complex for us to pursue.
<br>
<br>
A couple of examples:
<br>
<br>
1. Searching images of star quadrants is more than suited to mechanical methods. The human error is 3 orders of magnitude greater than equivalent machinery. Here is a well defined case of machines exceeding human perception -  as long as rules for detection are well formulated.
<br>
<br>
2. Detecting fraud patterns in credit card usage. This problem consistently requires an external reference system for as fraud is detected, new rules are enforced. However, as these rules work to minimize fraud, new fraudulent means are created - in other words they mutate. At present, even neural models cannot react in real time to detect fraud mutation. It requires human rule intervention.
<br>
<br>
In summary, I would not call this a singularity between man and machine but more of a punctuated equilibrium where advances in machine learning and devices will stimulate a larger order of magnitude expansion of human ingenuity.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Andre,
<br>
<br>
You seem to be saying two things at once.  You imply that human mind and machine intelligence each may have their own strengths and weaknesses, taking perhaps complementary roles, and (optimistically) each can gain from the other to advance.  This is an agreeable and "hopeful" vision.
<br>
<br>
However, I am not sure that "machine" capabilities will be as restricted to the "fragile, bit-error-like" ways it has taken to date.  The multi-layered systems of the mind/brain can largely (in principle) be emulated in machines, and the flexibility of machines to "recompose" themselves is something that the human mind may be incapable of doing (without extreme augmentation.)
<br>
<br>
I am "multi-layered" when I search the house for a lost object.  I apply my consciousness (main train of thought) to visual pattern-recognition as I search from room to room for the "matching image", and I do so, almost unaware of how I am navigating chairs and steps and not falling over.  My "motor-movement-equilibrium" system is almost autonomically taking care of business, under only the slightest direction on my "conscious" part.  But a well-designed robot, seeking a lost object, would also have delegated many autonomous activities to similar subsystems.  The images gained by the visual system would be servicing both the "search" heuristics and the "navigation" heuristics, each making use of different aspects of the scenery.
<br>
<br>
I once argued that machines/AI would not develop any sense of "emotion", by virtue of their lack of "body" and its chemically-induced psychological states.  I gave an example that I thought would be convincing, and then later thought otherwise.
<br>
<br>
We humans have likely inherited a healthy tendency to to fear the low growl of a tiger, and will respond with adrenal flows well in time for our feet to start running.  What if the growl is so distant that we are not conscious of having "heard" it, even though our auditory systems picked it up?  I suspect that our adrenaline will pick-up, and our heart begin to beat a bit faster, and THIS physiological manifestation we may become aware of.  We might say we feel "spooked", "nervous", "fearful", and yet not (yet) know why.  I asked myself, "how or why would a robot ever develop such a sensation"?
<br>
<br>
But then, it occured to me that a robot's autonomous "movement-navigation" systems might learn over time to prepare to flee upon hearing certain sounds, and (like the visual system's images are shared for distinct functions) the robot's auditory systems would likewise be shared.  The "main train of thought" process might be listening (focusing) upon a conversation, and not immediately be bothered by the sound of an approaching vehicle.  Perhaps the "movement-system" may have learned to react to "approaching vehicle sound" by beginning to rev its motor systems (in anticipation of the need for quick movement.)
<br>
<br>
Might the robot's "main thought processes" become interrupted, NOT (yet) by the sound of the approaching vehicle, but by the sound and vibration-sensation of the autonomous motor-system?  Might the robot be "surprised" that its "heart" is racing?  Whether it actually could "feel fear" the way we do, or not, it might still react "as if nervous", momentarily seeking explanation for its body's sudden "fight or flight" posture?
<br>
<br>
I would grant you that the brain's "depth" and complexity is something that machine intelligence will take a very long time to match ... but I see no fundamental barriers to this status, and thence rapid advance beyond.  The human mind still has room to "expand", but not (on its own) to any such degree for nearly unbounded expansion.
<br>
<br>
Singularity, for me, will be the point where robo-AI is able to control and adapt to its environment more effectively than humans can control or adapt to their own environment, however one cares to measure intelligence.
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Some questions I was thinking about:
<br>
All of the "lower" steps on the evolutionary ladder (i.e. energy, matter, all the way up to conscious and self-aware life-forms) currently inhabit the same time-frame.  So isn't it possible that the next steps on the evolutionary ladder already exist?  Would we we even know?  After all, when a monkey (lower life-form) looks at a human (higher life-form) does it think "That's a higher life-form" or does it think "I wonder if I could eat that"?
<br>
<br>
Also, communication is possible between steps on the evolutionary ladder, whether it is teaching sign-language to a gorilla or calling elephants with super low-frequency sound waves.  My point is, will the next step on the evolutionary ladder be able to communicate with us?  Coupled with question one, are they attempting to communicate with us right now?
<br>
<br>
Or is the difference between monkies and humans negligible compared to the difference between humans and post-humans, meaning these analogies are all flawed...</p></td>

<br>
<br>
It is true that most fruits of the "stages of evolution" are still present today.  Evolution is not so much replacement as it is augmentation.
<br>
<br>
Unlike (say) rodents, we have a degree of intellectual capability that allows us to consider the world in terms of time, species, and "superiority".  Measured in terms WE create, humans are "superior" to the cockroach.  In terms of evolution, neither human nor cockroach are superior, as both have "survived" to the present day.
<br>
<br>
As to which is more "ripe" for extinction, that is another matter.
<br>
<br>
But your real question, "Were it here, would we recognize it" is a good way to approach "are we expecting the right things".
<br>
<br>
Did a human put "a man on the moon"?  Or did the US, or "Western Society" or simply humanity, perform that accomplishment.  Where do you want to place the responsibility?
<br>
<br>
And is it evolution, per se, or simply "change" that is the center of people's concerns?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Raymond,
<br>
<br>
You are missing a fundamental notion of consciousness that causes you to be completely wrong in several assertions you constantly make.  For example you say:
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; At this point, it becomes a really deeply philosophical issue. Is that just a very clever simulation that's good enough to trick you, or is it really conscious in the way that we assume other people are? In my view there's no real way to test that scientifically. There's no machine you can slide the entity into where a green light goes on and says okay, this entity's conscious, but no, this one's not. You could make a machine, but it will have philosophical assumptions built into it. Some philosophers will say that unless it's squirting impulses through biological neurotransmitters, it's not conscious, or that unless it's a biological human with a biological mother and father it's not conscious. But it becomes a matter of philosophical debate. It's not scientifically resolvable. &lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
If what David Chalmers has said about the "Hard Problem" of consciousness is true then this will most definitely be scientifically resolvable.  This issue will be resolved by objectively "effing" the ineffable.
<br>
<br>
Take the currently ineffable taste of salt, for example.  Theoretically a person could have a defect somewhere in his brain's ability to produce this sensation from birth making it so this person has never known or experienced this taste.  Once we have the ability to correct such defects, we will be able to produce in this person's mind, this subjective experience (even without the presence of sodium chloride!)  The person's response (Or the response of an AI when it "effs" for the first time) will likely be something like "Oh THAT's what salt tastes like."  Because of our understanding of the proper "neural correlate" that has this quality we will know he is telling the truth when he says he now knows what the taste of salt is like.
<br>
<br>
Our brain uses these pheonomenal qualiaties to represent everything we consciously know.  Something in our brain has these phenomenal qualities that we still only know subjectively.  We will soon discover which cause and effect process of nature also has these phenomenal properties.  Just as the scientific process involves the identification and classification of fundamental elements into a periodic table of elements the scientific process will also identify and classify all these subjective experiences, or qualia, that we are able to experience.  The key difference of this table will be sufficient grounded information that will enable enhanced brains to "know" and experience or 'eff' the precise qualia represented by any particular entry in this table.
<br>
<br>
In this way, the "hard problem" of consciousness will be once and for all scientifically resolved.  This discovery of which matter in our brain has these additional phenomenal and subjective qualities will surely be the most significant and earth changing scientific achievement to date.
<br>
<br>
You almost get it right when you say things like:
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;People will beam their own flow of sensory experiences and the neurological correlates of their emotions out into the Web, the way people now beam images from web cams in their living rooms and bedrooms. This will enable you to plug in and actually experience what it's like to be someone else, including their emotional reactions, a'la the plot concept of Being John Malkovich. In virtual reality you don't have to be the same person. You can be someone else, and can project yourself as a different person.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
But you are still missing the simple idea of effing of the individual involuntary sensations our brain uses to represent this "flow of sensory experience" and the significance of all this in its ability to scientifically and objectively resolve the problem of other minds.  The only reason "virtual reality" works is because our mind is able to recognize the patters coming from our senses and from this produce conscious knowledge models made of qualia in our brain.
<br>
<br>
You foolishly make such a big deal about the Turing Test.  But in 20 years or less or after we achieve the ability to eff, people will look back and wonder how some one so smart could be so clueless about something that should be so simple and so obvious.  The simple fact of the matter is the only important question to ask in a Turing Test is something like: "What is red like?"
<br>
<br>
I've written a more in-depth and complete paper on this issue and how you are mistaken for anyone interested.  It is available here:

<br>
<br>
&gt; "Take the currently ineffable taste of salt, for example."
<br>
<br>
I still think this is more problematic than you make it.
<br>
<br>
Suppose that to me, the tastes of salt and sugar are reversed.  Everytime you place salt in my mouth, it will taste to me like sugar would to you, and I exclaim "that tastes like salt" (of course).  Naturally, I am going to call that taste what I've been trained from birth to call it.
<br>
<br>
Now, suppose you have never performed this experiment upon me, and do not know of my "reversed taste" sensation.  You give me a salt tablet, and study my "neural correlates".  What makes you suppose that there are ANY correlates there that speak "is experiencing a universally-recognized sugary taste"?
<br>
<br>
Even if such correlates were possible, they would only be recognized because (we assume) most folks would "sense salt and sugar" in coincident ways, providing a sort of "baseline" from which to measure.
<br>
<br>
Even then, you assume that my "appreciation" of what I sense is identical to some universal (at least, among humans) neural activity, when it might well be several-fold layers above, (patterns of patterns) or encoded in relation to memorized neural-ion concentrations that might be different for every individual, yet translates (for each of them) into a "salt-taste-recognition".
<br>
<br>
Finally, even if "salt-taste" appreciation could be found to have a universally recognizeable set of correlates, salt and sugar are rather close to the physical interface, chemistry to chemistry, so to speak.  Very much of what we experince as "minds" is far more abstracted, "sense of confinement, sense of freedom, sense of foreboding, sense of boredom", etc.
<br>
<br>
You may seek correlates, but that does not guarantee that they will exist.  Each "mind" may have found its own chaotic way to encode, reflect, and recognize these "senses".
<br>
<br>
Its not yet a "done deal", and I imagine it will be exceedingly hard to "establish" the existence, no less the universality and "template", for many of these qualities of experience.
<br>
<br>
(No reason not to try, 'though).

<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose that to me, the tastes of salt and sugar are reversed. Every time you place salt in my mouth, it will taste to me like sugar would to you, and I exclaim "that tastes like salt" (of course). Naturally, I am going to call that taste what I've been trained from birth to call it.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
Yes, this is commonly called 'Inverted Qualia' where one brain uses different qualia to represent particular sensory data.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What makes you suppose that there are ANY correlates there that speak "is experiencing a universally-recognized sugary taste"?&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
It is my theory that it will not be something that is 'spoken'.  Some of the matter in our brain has these particular phenomenal qualities.  Once we discover them, and which matter has them when in particular states, we will understand more about them.  'speaking' is an abstract cause and effect communication process.  But phenomenal qualities are something that just are rather than some cause or affect.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, even if "salt-taste" appreciation could be found to have a universally recognizable set of correlates, salt and sugar are rather close to the physical interface, chemistry to chemistry, so to speak. Very much of what we experience as "minds" is far more abstracted, "sense of confinement, sense of freedom, sense of foreboding, sense of boredom", etc.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
I believe it is a mistake to worry about these much more fleeting and complex voluntarily produced cognitions such as ideas and so on.  First we must focus on the very solid involuntary ones that represent direct sensa data.  We must first know the alphabet of thoughts and what they are made of before we can hope to understand what complex voluntarily produced thoughts are.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;You may seek correlates, but that does not guarantee that they will exist. Each "mind" may have found its own chaotic way to encode, reflect, and recognize these "senses".&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
I know, more than I know anything else (we could be nothing but a brain in a vat where nothing but these conscious representations exist), that my taste of salt, red, warm, and so on exist.  It's only a matter of time before I can eff these precice sensations to you so you will be able to tell if you have different or identical representations.  Once we can do this we'll be able to move on to try to understand more complex emotions and thoughts and interpretations and so on using this as a base to work on.

<br>
<br>
By definition, a translation is not a perfect expression; rather an approximation of a physical manifestion using whatever means that can be experienced and understood by an observer.
<br>
<br>
If the observer lacks one or more senses, then the physical object must be 'translated' into senses in which the observer may not be particularily suited to understand. Take the idea of describing a starry night to a blind person or rhythm to someone who is deaf. 
<br>
<br>
Unless one believes in the concept of 'memes', which has not been experimentally observed at the genetic level, then the man-machine interface will always be an approximation rather than an extension.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I don't think explaining a starry sky to a blind person is necessarily dificult, given the right conceptual and physical tools.
<br>
<br>
conveying the emotional power of a visual image is another story.
<br>
<br>
<br>
an anecdote that some may find interesting regarding experience of senses:
<br>
<br>
A couple days ago, my brother was letting one of our cats into the basement. The door is usually closed and the lights turned off.  The cat in question has a fondness for the basement and begs to be let into it. As my brother opened the door, he turned on the basement lights.
<br>
<br>
When I saw this, an idea occurred to me.  I asked him why he turned the lights on.  He responded "so it's nicer for her down there".
<br>
So I said something along the lines of "given their predatory nature and excellent low light vision, maybe cats actually tend to prefer darker enviornments, and perhaps even find them more aesthetically pleasing"
<br>
<br>
He agreed that was possible, but we ended up leaving the light on because anthropomorphizing is  a hard habit to break :-)
