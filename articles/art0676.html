<div class="TeaserText">What is the purpose of molecular manufacturing, who will create and own it, and what are the risks and impacts on the world? A social scientist believes these questions could best be addressed in an international nanotechnology conference and grassroots events.</div>

<p>Despite limited literature discussing the global implications of 
              molecular manufacturing (MM), the seeds for certain key debates 
              are starting to be sown. They essentially mirror those presented 
              for current and near-term nanotechnology<sup><a name="2"></a><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>: 
              for what purposes will the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> be developed and used, by 
              whom will it be created and owned, what is the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the risks 
              it will bring, and what kind of impact will it have upon the global 
              economy and developing world?</p>
<p>The realisation of MM's central goals<sup><a name="3"></a><a href="#f3">3</a></sup> 
              would undoubtedly lead to the most concentrated technological 'tsunami' 
              ever witnessed. The unpredictable nature of such a revolution makes 
              answering the previous questions all the more difficult. However, 
              just as <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> is commonly used as a yardstick for nanotechnology 
              evaluations (given the continuity of many social concerns and relationship 
              between existing biotechnology capabilities and potential to develop 
              nanotechnology [2]), we argue here that the best way to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up the 
              MM debate, in terms of its impact on developing countries, may be 
              to look at developments and trends in nanotechnology. Central to 
              such analysis is addressing the ways in which nanotechnology creates 
              new possibilities for developing countries in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to 
              technology, potential benefits, risks, and shifting views of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              and technology, as well as the imposing of new demands in terms 
              of infrastructure and approaches to science.</p>
<p>While many of the issues MM faces may be similar to those presently 
              developing with nanotechnology, MM offers a revolution of a starkly 
              different magnitude. However, MM still faces an '<a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> crisis' 
              in the developed world, and an 'identity absence' in the developing 
              world. This has been further hampered by authors and academics who, 
              in writing articles and papers concerning nanotechnology's impact 
              upon the developing world, mix the two terms and confuse references 
              to the relevant potential impacts [3]. Coupled with hype surrounding 
              '<a class="thought" href="entries/grey_goo_entry.html">grey goo</a>', a poor foundation for international discussions in which 
              to include MM has evolved. There need to be consistent efforts by 
              those writing in the area to distinguish the kind of nanotechnology 
              to which they are referring.</p>
<p>However, while the scope of potential impact differs greatly between 
              nanotechnology and MM, <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> suggests there will be universal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s in terms of its distribution. Whether MM is developed to 
              either a limited or a full <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, it is more than likely the 
              majority of the world will never reap its benefits and perhaps even 
              fewer will know or understand its potential.</p>
<p>The location of MM's initial development will play a key role in 
              the resolution of suggestions that MM will increase global <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> 
              control [4], eradicate natural resource markets to the detriment 
              of developing countries [4, 5] or reduce global inequalities and 
              allow countries to 'leap-frog' the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a> [1]. Some 
              suggest that industrialised countries are more fertile ground for 
              its development [6], while others believe China and India are in 
              a more likely position than the United States of America and European 
              Union to be the initial producers<a name="4"></a><sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> 
              [7]. However, as McCarthy notes, "just possessing the technology 
              does not mean that a given state will be able to use it to full 
              advantage" [6]. Countries will require an ability to integrate and 
              respond to MM in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to exploit its potential.</p>
<p>In more recent times, debates have extended to consider MM's initial 
              development by both small and big <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> groups, within private 
              and public spheres, by <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>d and unstructured research groups, 
              as well as by 'rogue' and 'peaceful' nations.</p>
<p>Assessing nanotechnology, we notice an increasing 'nano-divide' 
              in terms of national research levels and funding, as much amongst 
              the developing countries themselves as between the developed and 
              the developing world [8]. This highlights the limitations of discussing 
              the developing world as if it was an homogeneous grouping. Emerging 
              technology affects regions, countries, populations and communities 
              in vastly disparate ways. Already, 62 countries are engaging with 
              nanotechnology on a national level. Nineteen of them are classified 
              as 'developing' but none of these are from the group of countries 
              classified as 'least developed'. However, via nanotechnology we 
              may be witness to a new form of inexpensive access to niche R&amp;D 
              markets, as demonstrated by development of national nanotechnology 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s in countries such as Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when spending is adjusted for purchasing-power <a class="thought" href="entries/parity_entry.html">parity</a>, 
              Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> nanotechnology funding ranks second, internationally, 
              behind the United States of America [9]. Nonetheless, funding (on 
              an absolute basis) remains heavily focussed towards programs in 
              industrialised countries of the European Union, the United States 
              of America and Japan.</p>
<p>It appears that smaller national programs will require clear, specific 
              strategic roadmaps that target niche research and consider significant 
              international collaboration if they wish to be part of the 'nanotechnology 
              revolution'.</p>
<p>Initial applications in nanotechnology, such as in cosmetics, sporting 
              apparatus and clothing, have exposed early indicators as to the 
              nature of research orientation. Increasing levels of private sector 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> concentration within the developed world [10], promoting 
              'broadbrush' patents, have added to developing country concerns. 
              By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> MM arrives, corporate control in areas such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 
              sciences will be so strong and patents and other forms of technological 
              control<sup><a name="5"></a><a href="#f5">5</a></sup> so all-encompassing, 
              that the ability to replicate a multi-functional theranostic kit 
              cheaply and rapidly may have little or no bearing on its ability 
              to reach those in greatest need.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that 'economic abundance' resulting from the 
              realisation of MM will negate such a trend. MacGillivray disagrees, 
              believing that with MM "the <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> of production will change&#8230; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> nature won't" [11]. History also disagrees. While economic 
              theory is based on scarcity, the current world <i>is</i> already 
              one of abundance. We 'solved' the 'production issue' long ago. Given 
              the world's current population, we do not need greater production 
              to feed such a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>. Rather, we require more equitable distribution 
              of resources, <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s in consumption and the recognition that 
              true 'equality' (at Western standards of living) is not sustainable. 
              As the 2002 United Nations' Human Development report notes, if the 
              per capita <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> consumption of developing countries were to rise 
              to even half of that of the advanced industrial economies, the energy 
              reserves of this finite <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> soon would be exhausted [12].</p>
<p>Despite the orientation of early applications, a number of groups 
              remain hopeful that nanotechnology can be 'appropriate' and used 
              to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals [13-15]. Similarly, 'nanofactories' 
              have been touted as 'appropriate technology' on the basis of their 
              potential to reduce skilled labour and supporting infrastructure 
              requirements [16]. However, it depends whether a nanofactory would 
              reduce skilled or <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> labour. If the latter, then it fails Schumacher's 
              criteria for an appropriate technology [17].</p>
<p>Furthermore, assessments of appropriateness must include assessments 
              of risk. As with nanotechnology, suggestions have been made that 
              MM could promote world peace [6] while others have cautioned that 
              it may, initially, prove quite dangerous [18]. Consistently, reports 
              are finding that research into nanotechnology risk is inadequate 
              and under-funded. With MM offering less chance to both predict and 
              react to issues of risk, the key must be to focus on global capacity 
              building in areas of risk assessment and risk management.</p>
<p>The problem with developed country discussions of nanotechnology 
              for the developing world is that they often don't <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> beyond 
              the identification of so-called 'appropriate' applications. Very 
              few people have even arrived at an acceptance that there <i>are</i> 
              'appropriate applications', full stop. MM continues to struggle 
              for mainstream acceptance and it is, perhaps, more likely that its 
              fruition will come via a gradual extension of nanoscale capabilities, 
              rather than an immediate jump to MM.</p>
<p>In terms of capacity requirements, nanotechnology is changing both 
              the way science is conducted within research teams and promoted 
              to the public. As we move to a scale unable to be viewed by a standard 
              microscope, and less likely to be comprehended, environmental and 
              human health risk become increasingly <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issues with which 
              to engage the public. Early commentators have suggested that nanotechnology 
              will reinforce the lessons from the GM-debate: that public participation 
              is crucial to acceptance but 'engineering consent' is not a sustainable 
              means for widespread acceptance and development. In my <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              with researchers in Thailand, India and Australia, there is a strong 
              recognition that capacity development in nanotechnology must incorporate 
              ethicists and legal experts in terms of analysing national regulatory 
              frameworks, maximising competitive advantage and contributing to 
              public dialogue. Finally, nanotechnology is demanding and creating 
              a more interdisciplinary view of science at the research level. 
              Since MM will most probably enter in a climate shaped by nanotechnology's 
              legacy in these areas, it is important that such considerations 
              extend to MM debates.</p>
<p>All these considerations lead me to make two suggestions.</p>
<p>The first suggestion is that we work towards a <i>truly</i> international 
              nanotechnology conference some time around 2010. Such a conference 
              would ideally occur within the United Nations framework and involve 
              official country representatives. It would be of great benefit to 
              the conference, in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a>, if countries submitted 
              'white papers' prior to the commencement of the proceedings, outlining 
              national capacities, strategies and proposed niche markets in nanotechnology. 
              Such a meeting could also incorporate discussion on the proposed 
              International Convention for the Evaluation of New Technologies<sup><a name="6"></a><a href="#f6">6</a></sup> 
              and gauge reception of and progress towards MM. The Global Nanotechnology 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a><a name="7"></a><sup><a href="#f7">7</a></sup> as well as 
              the Asia Nano Forum<a name="8"></a><sup><a href="#f8">8</a></sup> 
              provide good examples and existing infrastructure for any efforts 
              to develop international cooperation and consensus.</p>
<p>The second suggestion is that, replicating a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> such as the 
              United Kingdom's Royal Academy of Engineering 'upstreaming' approach<a name="9"></a><sup><a href="#f9">9</a></sup>, 
              civil <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> groups should seek to increase nanotechnology and 
              MM exposure at international 'grassroots' events such as the World 
              Social Forum. Such efforts hopefully would pave the way for greater 
              developing country engagement in academic writing and scholarship 
              pertaining to these areas.</p>
<p>Despite significant differences in the potential capabilities of 
              nanotechnology and MM, nanotechnology may offer the greatest insights 
              and means by which to influence the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> impact of MM with respect 
              to the developing world. Initially, a clear distinction must be 
              made between nanotechnology and MM. Current nanotechnology indicators 
              point towards increasing concern for the developing world in terms 
              of barriers to technology access, inadequate research into environmental 
              and human health risks, and significant demands in terms of the 
              capacity to respond to and develop nanotechnology. Any study of 
              MM and its potential impacts upon the developing world will gain 
              from an appreciation of the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> and developments surrounding 
              nanotechnology.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Intels new fabs will bring 65 nm Transistors
<br>
<br>
So Next 2 years we will be transforming from Information Technology Era to Nanotechnology Era.
<br>
<br>
And Nanotechnology Era will bring as much surprises as the Computers bought a decade ago.
<br>
<br>
Had anyone imagined the Games, CDs, DVDs, Digital Cammera, Internet etc in the 1980s.
<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology will bring simmilar changes with 5-10 years and we will see everything upside down. Just like today every Office &amp; house has computers.
