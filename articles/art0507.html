<div class="TeaserText">The accelerating growth of technology has brought opportunities to the blind but has also created barriers, says Ray Kurzweil. "At the end of this first decade of this new century, everyone will be on-line all the time with very high speed, wireless communication woven into their clothing. Within a couple of decades, we will have established new high bandwidth pathways of communication directly to and from our brains. Will this represent a great enabler for blind students and workers or a new set of obstructions?" Former National Federation of the Blind president Dr. Kenneth Jernigan's vision of "the world&#237;s first world-class research and training institute for the blind" should help.</div>
<br>
<br><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net 
            July 9, 2002.</i>
<p>Twenty-seven years ago, I had the honor of meeting Dr. Jernigan, 
              and other leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. Back 
              then, Jim Gashel headed up the Washington office and displayed the 
              same passion and strategic brilliance then that he would demonstrate 
              in this crucial position for the next quarter century. Marc Maurer 
              was then a young student, but was already demonstrating his commitment 
              and leadership capacities as the NFB's student leader. </p>
<p>I had the privilege of working intimately with the NFB's <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers 
              and scientists, under the leadership of Michael Hingson, to create 
              a print-to-speech <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a>. The lessons of that <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              have animated my career since that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant of which 
              is the following. If you want to create a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, then the 
              people to turn to, the people who have the motivation and the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              to do the job right, are the intended users themselves.</p>
<p>I've remained involved with <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for the 
              last 27 years, most recently with Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">Education</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s, 
              and have remained close to the NFB, both of which have been deeply 
              rewarding <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s. The NFB succeeds for two <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s: the endless 
              reservoir of dedication of its members, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> of its leadership.</p>
<p>Dr. Kenneth Jernigan was a leader in the tradition of Moses and 
              Martin Luther King. And like both of these men, he would be unable 
              to personally <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> the promised land toward which he had so 
              skillfully led his people. In his last year of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, Dr. Jernigan 
              articulated a vision that he knew he would never get to see: the 
              world's first world-class <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and training institute for the 
              blind. It was a prophetic vision, and in a moment I'll share with 
              you why I believe that to be the case.</p>
<p>Unlike many other leaders, Dr. Jernigan knew he was a mortal man 
              and prepared for new leadership long before there was any <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> 
              to believe there was any impending <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to do so. He nurtured 
              Marc Maurer's leadership skills, and as is evident at this convention, 
              was as successful in this endeavor as in everything else he did. 
              When Dr. Jernigan passed from the scene, the vision of the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              and training institute was just that: a vision, and a daunting challenge 
              that many doubted would ever come to fruition. It is a fitting testament 
              to Dr. Jernigan's lifetime of leadership, and a reflection of the 
              dedication of the NFB's membership and the continuation of inspired 
              leadership in the person of Dr. Maurer, that this institute now 
              rises like a sphinx in the outskirts of Baltimore. </p>
<p>Let me share with you why I think Dr. Jernigan's vision came at 
              a propitious <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> has always been <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant, but we 
              are now standing on the precipice of an inflection point in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> is reaching what I call the <a class="thought" href="entries/knee_of_the_curve_entry.html">knee of the curve</a>, 
              a point in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in which its inherently <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is taking 
              off at a nearly vertical slope. I've studied <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends for 
              several decades and developed mathematical models of its <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion. 
              The most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant insight that I've gained from this study is that 
              the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is itself accelerating. While people are quick 
              to agree with this assessment, few observers have truly internalized 
              the profound implications of this acceleration. It means that the 
              past is not a reliable guide to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. We're doubling what 
              I call the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rate every decade. So the twentieth century 
              was not 100 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> because 
              we've been accelerating up to this point. The last 100 years was 
              akin to 20 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. And we'll 
              make another 20 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, equal 
              to all of the twentieth century, in the next fourteen years. And 
              then we'll do it again in another seven years. Because of the power 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, the twenty-first century will be like 20,000 
              years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, which is a thousand 
              times more change than what we witnessed in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The other insight I've had is that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is a mixed blessing. 
              It brings both promise and peril. If we could magically go back 
              200 years ago and describe the dangers of today's world to the people 
              back then -- as just one example enough nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s to destroy 
              all <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> -- they would think it crazy to take 
              such risks. On the other hand, how many of us today would want to 
              go back to the world of two hundred years ago? Before you raise 
              your hands, consider this. If it wasn't for the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of the 
              past two centuries, most of us here tonight wouldn't be here tonight. 
              Average <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy in the year 1800 was only 37 years. And 
              most people on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> lived lives filled with <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, hard labor, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, and disaster, not to mention the ignorance and prejudice 
              that was rampant with regard to the capabilities of the blind. </p>
<p>So, we've come a long way through both promise and peril. And few 
              of us would want to go back. As Dr. Maurer has said many times, 
              we'll never go back, certainly not to the lack of opportunity that 
              was the rule for blind people a half century ago. </p>
<p>We also see the promise and peril of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in its impact on 
              the blind. The digitization of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> has brought many opportunities 
              as blind people have led the world in rates of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> literacy. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading machine</a>s, screen readers, voice-based news services such 
              as the NFB's News Line, and Braille translators, <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>s, and note 
              takers have all provided greater opportunity. But the downside of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has also been evident. With the great profusion of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              displays, <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> for the blind is often an afterthought if it is 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of at all. The moment text-based screen readers were perfected, 
              the graphic user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> was introduced. It then took at least 
              a decade for <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a>-based screen readers to become workable, at 
              which <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of challenges emerged from a profusion of new 
              web-based protocols such as <a class="thought" href="#">Flash</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/java_entry.html">Java</a> that are once again creating 
              barriers. </p>
<p>This intertwined promise and peril is going to accelerate. At the 
              end of this first decade of this new century, everyone will be on-line 
              all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> with very high speed, <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> woven 
              into their clothing. Will this represent a great enabler for blind 
              students and workers? Or will it represent a new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of obstructions? 
              To assure the former, we'll need new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> breakthroughs, public 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ibility standards, and a panoply of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s for training 
              and availability. This is why Dr. Jernigan's initiative was prophetic. 
            </p>
<p>Scientists are beginning to perfect new ways of communicating directly 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. There are already four major conferences 
              devoted to a field called bioMEMS: <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> micro-<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that are beginning to noninvasively place intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s 
              inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> blood stream and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Within a couple of decades, 
              we will have established new high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> pathways of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> 
              directly to and from our brains. Will these radical new technologies 
              be a good thing for blind people? Well, I suspect that the National 
              Federation of the Blind will have something to say about how these 
              developments are deployed and to assuring that they bring promise 
              rather than peril for the blind. </p>
<p> It looks like we will have the NFB's National <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> and Training 
              Institute for the Blind just in the nick of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Despite his illness, 
              Dr. Jernigan realized he did not have a moment to lose in articulating 
              his vision. And this is why I believe that Dr. Jernigan's foresight 
              was a prophecy.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>As one on the periphery of the blind movement (my wife recently took care of the NFB's Washington affairs for a few years under the direction of James Gashel) I can say it may not be overstatement to suggest that the NFB/Kurzweil relationship several years ago created a micro industry.  
<br>
<br>
Technological helps for blind individuals such as those mentioned in the article provide a tremendous benefit for those seeking to enter the mainstream workforce and society in general.  
<br>
<br>
Today's IT tools for the blind are getting closer to those designed for the population at large in terms of sophistication--and in some cases are on the cutting edge--but several factors combine to keep costs extremely high for many of these tools.  For instance, my Compaq iPAQ with all its functionality is about $500.  My wife's CE enabled note taker with somewhat comparable features is about $5,000.  
<br>
<br>
This trend will likely continue if blind technology development remains on a perhaps parallel but nevertheless separate growth path from mainstream technology if for no other reason than the fact that the market is relatively small compared to that of the population in general.
<br>
<br>
If an advance such as OCR technology comes along that allows a blind person to scan a document and convert it to text then its cost per user is proportionate to the number of potential users.  If the potential market ends at the edge of the blind community that number is relatively small (although much bigger than most would imagine).  
<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, that technology has applications for the public at large then costs go down, competition emerges to drive innovation, and everyone benefits. 
<br>
<br>
I agree with Dr. Kurzweil that the challenge is to get developers of mainstream technology to design with an awareness of the needs of the blind community.  His initiative to specifically design tools for the needs of the blind seems to be one of if not t-h-e event that set the ball in motion for all the tools that now exist.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Jernigan's vision will probably serve as a conduit for enterprising individuals to continue this trend for many years to come.
