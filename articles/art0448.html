<div class="TeaserText">Experts were asked to describe normative (preferred) scenarios for technology, human development, and politics/economics in the year 2050. Their ideas were compiled into three scenarios by two leading futurists for the Millennium Project of the American Council for the United Nations University. "The authors provide some insightful scenarios," says Ray Kurzweil. "However, I feel that their time frames do not adequately reflect the accelerating pace of progress inherent in what I call the law of accelerating returns.  The types of changes they describe for 2050 will arrive much earlier in my view."</div>

<a href="#technological">Technological Theme</a><br>

<a href="#political">Political Economic Policy Theme</a></p>
<p><a name="background"></a>Although the following may look like three 
              alternative normative scenarios, they are intended to be one scenario 
              with three interdependent themes. Each theme represents a different 
              perspective on how change occurs. Some believe <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is the 
              key force that has made change occur. Others argue that changing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> is more fundamental to long-term 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>ic change. Still others say that political and economic policies 
              create the conditions for changes in both <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. 
              The following global normative scenario assumes that all three themes 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to the realization of the normative <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of 2050. 
            </p>
<p>The process that created this scenario was initiated two years 
              ago. A more detailed explanation can be found in last year's State 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> or at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100203221526/http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/scenarios.html" target="_blank">http://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/scenarios.html</a>. 
              Very simply, Millennium Project participants identified and rated 
              norms that formed the core of the normative scenario. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 
              preference, the participants selected the following top four norms 
              around which to form the scenario: environmental sustainability, 
              plenty, global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> (the identified and accepted), and peace. 
              The others in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of preference were health, <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>, universal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, equity, preservation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, enlightenment, 
              exciting and meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, self-actualization, longevity, everyone 
              has everything they want, and security. </p>
<p>The body of the normative scenario is composed of the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s to 
              address the Global Challenges in Chapter 2. These <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s connected 
              the present world to the normative <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of 2050 and gave another 
              medium to share the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> of the Global Lookout Panel. A scenario 
              review panel was formed of long-term normative-oriented participants 
              of the Project to reviewed and improve the draft of the scenario. 
              As this is an ongoing process, your suggestions for improvements 
              are welcome and may help shape next year's edition. Even though 
              the following normative scenario takes into account many of the 
              world's pressing problems, it is intended to illustrate very optimistic 
              possibilities for our common <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> over the next two generations. 
            </p>
<h1><a name="normative"></a>A Normative World in 2050 </h1>
<p>By 2050 the world had finally achieved a global economy that appears 
              to be environmentally sustainable while providing nearly all people 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> necessities of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and the majority with a comfortable 
              living. The resulting social stability has created a world in relative 
              peace, exploring possible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s for the second half of the 21st 
              century. </p>
<p>Different explanations have been given for the series of astounding 
              successes achieved by 2050. Some believe that breakthroughs in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> were the keys, others that development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              potential was more fundamental, and still others that political 
              and economic polices made the difference. All three themes were 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant and mutually reinforcing. </p>
<h1><a name="technological"></a>Technological Theme </h1>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> has become a right of citizenship. Businesses give free 
              accounts to all customers; employers give them as an employee benefit. 
              The connection of virtually all people to the global <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s accelerated the pace of scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>

<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and improve decision making. Molecular manufacturing 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>) lowered manufacturing unit cost, requiring less 
              volume of materials and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> usage, and hence, lowered the environmental 
              impact of a population that had almost reached 10 billion. Vaccinology 
              and genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering eliminated most acquired and inherited <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s 
              further reducing the need for more frequent pregnancies to have 
              a similar sized family. This was a factor in further lowering fertility 
              rates, even though generational mini-booms have continued from the 
              great population explosion in the mid-20th century. <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">Cyberspace</a> had 
              become a major medium of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> creating a constantly growing, 
              non zero-sum economy and had changed day-to-day <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as significantly 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a> had changed <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 200 years earlier. 
              The success of the International <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Station had led to other 
              orbital habitats, the lunar base, and the pioneer communities on 
              Mars. Nearly 250,000 people now work in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> communities in <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a>, 
              on the moon, and on Mars, giving a new frontier for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a> 
              and advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. </p>
<p>Breakthroughs in the unified theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> have led 
              to a deeper understanding of mass, inertia, <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> and quantum 
              behavior. <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a>s have begun in the field of anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> and 
              faster-than-<a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s through the use of quantum phenomena. 
              There are perhaps a hundred scientists who are studying possibilities 
              of extracting intrinsic, resting <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and using it 
              in various forms of propulsion. Cosmologists are adding more rigor 
              to their theories of the origin of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and have duplicated 
              the earliest <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulations that seem almost exact, 
              but the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> still continues. Some signals of apparently <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> 
              origin have been detected but debates continue over whether they 
              are truly <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s, and if <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a>, 
              over their precise meaning. </p>
<p>The debates about the potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> contact have 
              forced us to think beyond our geographic and ethnic boundaries. 
              Additionally, scientific breakthroughs, the ease of international 
              and near-<a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> travel, and the constant global <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s among 
              people of different views on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> and near-<a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> have also helped 
              broaden our perspectives. As a result, people began replacing their 
              more parochial views and consider global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> more seriously. 
              Not all people value <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, truth, fairness, family, <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>, and 
              belonging, but far more than in the 20th century and enough to keep 
              a relatively peaceful world. The field of conflict resolution, which 
              has made great <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> since its earliest applications a hundred 
              years ago, recognizes these simple points and its councilors builds 
              on them in resolving disputes. Interestingly, the Great Cyber Games 
              played by one out of every three people alive today were <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al 
              in the identification and acceptance of these global ethical norms 
              which provide much of the common ground for today's global cooperation. 
              Although ethnic prejudice still exists, it has been held in check 
              more effectively than in the previous century. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> has been astounding. <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">Microprocessor</a>s 
              have continued to increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>; they are speeder, smaller, 
              and less expensive. Today <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are built into and integral 
              with almost everything we make from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and appliance to buildings 
              and artificial eyes with zoom lenses. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s are molecular 
              in size, and their <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s utilize quantum behavior. </p>
<p>Much of the computing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> today makes <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s simpler to 
              use. Rather than requiring everyone to learn to use them, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              have been taught to listen and act to needs and wishes of their 
              users. The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world's vast amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> has been translated 
              into <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and related technologies with <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> so easy an natural 
              people use them without even knowing it making them seem truly transparent. 
            </p>
<p>Health is a widely accepted <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> right; equity in coverage and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ibility to quality health services and health <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              exist regardless of <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to pay, culture, race, geographic location 
              or social ascription. Tele-health and tele-<a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> is widely available 
              and easily <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible. Health care providers adopt new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s 
              to forecast and prevent potential health problems through personal 
              and public health approaches; early detection through biomonitoring 
              and management of problems that do occur. </p>
<p>Some people used to believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s would regiment us by 
              forcing us to conform to their specifications in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to use them. 
              Today <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that use them have supported <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> 
              through mass customization. Manufacturers make very short production 
              runs of products that are tailored to the specific needs of very 
              small segments of consumers, differing in detail, but matching their 
              criteria. The <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that uses one's body as passwords

<p>The old one-way <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> tended to be conflict-oriented, audiences 
              were held by the drama of disagreement. Interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> tended 
              to be cooperation-oriented, users were held together by the satisfaction

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of secure <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> money revolutionized retail 
              transactions, international trade, and provided extraordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              of employment. <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">Individual</a>s felt confident to create businesses and

              early publicity and attention, business-to-business transactions 
              have grown phenomenally. Today, businesses of any size identify

              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for central banks made currency transactions transparent

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/synergy_entry.html">synergy</a> of telematics and micro-<a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> provided a jump in

<p>Telecitizens, born in poorer areas but working in richer ones, 
              helped their original countries as tele-volunteers, accelerating

              and its use in <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s provided <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s with needed and

<p>The image of people walking by vending <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, reaching in their 
              pockets, but finding no coins and walking on, drove distributors 
              in the early 21st Century to create voice activated <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that 
              billed at the end of the month on people's cyber game accounts. 
              The televenders had a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/voice_recognition_entry.html">voice recognition</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              that let people speak to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, use their body <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s as 
              their pass word, <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> their sandwich, soft drink, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, 
              and play in the Great Cyber Games while they drank or ate alone 
              or with friends. </p>
<p>The Great Cyber Games contained links to <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s that described 
              global problems, opportunities, challenges, strategies, and tactics. 
              Players received points as they identified answers that matched 
              or improved on those in the <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> or identified new problems 
              judged to be critical enough to add to the <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>. When a person 
              scored enough points, they won "reality." They got a prerecorded 
              message from a policy maker working on the issue in which the player 
              had received the highest score. The message challenged the player 
              to play in the "real world game." The current real world 
              situation was given to the player by the policy-maker, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er, 
              or potential employer. When the player came up with something that 
              was considered valuable, the player got connected live to discuss 
              their insight. Winners got to play in the real global game with 
              real actors and many got new jobs and careers. </p>
<p>The Great Cyber Games were attractive to policy or other kind of 
              decision-makers because it filtered out all the <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              conferences, journal articles, and got right to the person with 
              the ideas. The players liked it because they had the potential to 
              see their ideas realized and earn a living at meaningful work. <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> labs used it to identify the young scientists with the 
              greatest potential to participate in their <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. An unintended 
              byproduct of the game was a global personnel selection <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that 
              today is credited for contributing to the phenomenal <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in new 
              theoretical principles that have led to many improvements. Another 
              surprise was that it performed the role of a global employment agency. 
            </p>
<p>The Great Cyber Games also became an informal way to prevent some 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a>'s destruction by promoting more precise, 
              honest, and compassionate <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> around the globe where it was 
              needed, when it was needed, and in the form that was needed, so 
              that constructive <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> has had a chance to kept ahead of destructive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Granted, it continues to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> race to keep ahead 
              of the bad guys. </p>
<p>When it was scientifically demonstrated that certainty of discovery 
              was the most effective deterrent to dishonesty and crime, means 
              for improving certainty of discovery and positive identification, 
              based on voice analysis and cross-referencing, global <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> bases 
              were created and the crime rates fell. International protocols were 
              established for sharing police <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> banks and the use of non-lethal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s such as sticky foams and aerosols that induce sleep. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> transceivers with voice stress <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> were incorporated 
              into clothing and jewelry; these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s alerted the user when people 
              were lying or becoming aggressive. Although counter <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> will 
              always be a problem, requiring constant upgrades, people have become 
              more honest, or at least behave more honestly than in the last century. 
              It is difficult to imagine a return of dictatorships and to the 
              organized crime <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of the past with today's global connectivity 
              and honestware universally available. </p>
<p>The field of <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> has been extremely <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to the 
              success of our world. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> helps produce low cost and 
              custom designed food. As <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> breaks down dirt, air, and water 
              and re-assembles the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s into potatoes, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> "universal

              the instructions from custom designed food <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to manufactures 
              food. With <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, whatever we can design, we can build. 
              The same <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that had been used to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> 
              chips was used to produce tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. For example, a mass spectrograph, 
              complete with all valves and analysis apparatus was made on a <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>. Motors are now constructed with diameters of less than millimeter; 
              accelerometers used in automobile air bags are too small to be seen 
              with the naked eye. It is commonplace to use <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> materials 
              in such chips now to <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> the reaction to various contaminants 
              or initiate <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s based on their presence. Technologists have 
              learned about forces that occur uniquely at this scale (e.g. lubricants 
              can have <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that are too large to work properly in such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s) 
              and have developed special molecular forms (fullerines) that have 
              desired properties. Some applications today are sensors for transition 
              from laminar to turbulent flow on the surface of wings, and the 
              distortion of the airfoils to delay transition, measurement of the 
              purity of water supplies with micro "fish", telemetry 
              transmitters that can be swallowed to measure reactions in the body, 
              and measurement of the stress induced in buildings by earthquakes 
              using sensors that were cast into the structural concrete. </p>
<p>All of this activity has had a great affect on materials <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. 
              After a plateau that lasted for several decades, <a class="thought" href="entries/superconductivity_entry.html">superconductivity</a> 
              is being <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d at higher and higher temperature; now thin 
              film superconductors exist at -100 degrees Celsius. The developments 
              in this field included bio-<a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, low pressure diamond coatings, 
              ultra <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> solids that float in air, and composite materials strong 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> enough to form the skin of a large scale rocket designed 
              to enter <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a> with a single stage. </p>
<p>New forms and mechanisms of the distributed global economy began 
              to emerge in the early 21st century. A whole new lexicon was developed 
              to describe the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms that built cyber culture and 
              the collaborative economies of today. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> agents assisted our 
              transition. They sought new opportunities for collaboration, alerted 
              us to synchronicity to discover the value of new and counter intuitive 
              ideas, and coached us in new forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a>. They even 
              produced images of fields of people, places, and opportunities of 
              cooperative intent. Such "fields of cooperative intent" 
              are one of the new units of social organization and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ial 
              effort. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> have become added measures of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> 
              and value. </p>
<p>Global idea management <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s were integrated into the Great Cyber 
              Games, further accelerating the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of more environmentally 
              friendly economic and technological development. Common <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> protocols 
              for unconventional <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and an international registry of new 
              and unconventional ideas with national <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a> protections was 
              connected to clearinghouses that reported success, failure, and 
              inconclusive <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. Use of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that prompted the user to 
              see potential synergies of their work with <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in other fields, 
              that they might not have otherwise considered, has now become a 
              useful protocol in all fields. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a> has created high yield plant <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that are <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> 
              and pest-resistant, use less fertilizer and are more tolerant of 
              drought and brackish water. More recent applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> 
              are completely changing the 10,000 year traditional use of seeds, 
              water and land to grow crops. Today large scale production of food 
              in factories using genetic techniques produce much of the world's 
              food. Food factories use genetically altered micro-<a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s to 
              organize raw materials into nutritious food. The inputs are primarily 
              sunlight or other <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> forms, <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide, water, and <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>ous 
              materials. The output is amino acids and directly consumable food. 
              In another approach, cells from natural foods such as carrots or 
              meat are cloned and the outputs of the food factories are edible 
              replications of the parent cells. Such techniques make agricultural 
              production possible without land. It is also beginning to reduce 
              the need for farmland for meat by producing <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, substituting 
              meat from cows and chickens. Such meat substitutes for fish has

              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that pinpoint specific sites in the body. Techniques in 
              this field have led to genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> in which the genetic properties

              and in some cases, the propensity to abhorrent behavior. </p>
<p>The traditional view of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> reproduction is still undergoing 
              changes simultaneously with the increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward self-determination,

              and <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> roles. Some of the more controversial advances have centered 
              on long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> contraceptives, the ability to select 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> of a child before <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion, and the ability to influence 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> and biochemical processes. The world became quite alarmed 
              in the early 21st Century when low cost and portable <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s for 
              determining the <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> of a baby before <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion became commonly 
              available. Many feared that parents in some cultures would only 
              select males, distorting the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> demographics of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race. 
              After several years of intense debate, threats of international 
              sanctions, interventions of leading personalities, and a short but 
              rapid increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> births in some countries, the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> births returned to balance. This left many uneasy about 
              unforeseen consequences of new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. As a result, technological 
              forecasting and assessment has become a normal part of the work 
              in advanced institutes today. </p>
<p>The World <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Organization, created in the early 21st century, 
              coordinated <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and helped improve policy leading to today's 
              safer mix of sources that have reversed the greenhouse effect. These 
              include <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>, third generation fission plants, solar power satellites,

              use. In its gaseous form it was stored at high density in metal 
              hydrides and later released by a modest amount of heat. In addition 
              to extracting it from natural gas, it is also produced from water 
              by electrolysis (the focus here was on a new form of catalysis) 
              and by high temperature disassociation of water, processes that 
              use a great deal of electricity or very high temperature. The former 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of extraction from water has provided the basis for an argument 
              to build second and third generation nuclear plants and solar satellites, 
              while the later for large-scale solar thermal plants. An additional 
              benefit of the production of <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> from seawater has been desalination 
              to produce fresh water and hence preventing water conflicts in the

<p>Thousands of 100-mile long robotically managed closed-environment

              Some argue that migration from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> is inevitable; it is in the

<p>Hierarchical institutions of the 20th century have given way to

<p>The acknowledgment that <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> was the solution to many problems 
              and that the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> economy was spreading rapidly, stimulated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s and corporations worldwide to increase their investments 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, training, and applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/cognitive_science_entry.html">cognitive science</a>. The 
              race to educate the world began after the World Summit on Cognitive 
              Development in 2010. Most institutions that had even a peripheral 
              association with <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> began debating the most equitable and 
              cost/effective ways to make everyone <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able, virtuous, and 
              intelligent. <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> became a right of citizenship. <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">Education</a>al

<p>The transition from a mostly illiterate global population to a 
              mostly educated world was achieved by the mid-2040s. The interconnection 
              of many separate <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s into a global <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> created

              own pace, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> style, and in their own <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. Ethical and 
              effective decision-making was a new focus of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. The availability 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> of all sorts, married with an integrated global scholarly 
              and scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>, increased the speed of problem solving 
              in all fields, by providing a logically <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>d framework into 
              which existing and newly acquired <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> could be placed and 
              assimilated in a non-redundant way for examination, discussion, 
              and extension by scientists and scholars worldwide and for a full 
              range <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al applications. Academic and business interests 
              collaborated to create a sophisticated body of principles and techniques 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> visualization and the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              to make it possible to rapidly navigate the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the world. 
              This allowed for <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> to be connected, reducing confusion 
              and culture shock in cyber <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. </p>
<p>The Global Cyber Games was integrated with the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              so that one could move easily between play and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. An unanticipated 
              consequence of the games was the large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people it helped 
              to identify and acknowledge global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of responsible

<p>In addition to the vast improvements in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of conventional public <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> also changed during

              and dealing with uncertainty. It emphasized compassionate behavior 
              and socially acceptable values such as tolerance and <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>. 
              Instruction in "how to learn" and the <a class="thought" href="entries/scientific_method_entry.html">scientific method</a> 
              was given greater prominence in both <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and professional 
              training <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Multi- and transdisciplinary techniques and non-<a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> approaches became common in most curricula. It is generally 
              accepted that the creative process included failure, <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, uncertainty, 
              and holding of contradictory positions. The speed of feedback from 
              inquiry to intelligent response is so fast today that curiosity 
              has become a normal mental state for adults. </p>
<p>Advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">cybernetics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive development increased

<p>It was not enough to learn and understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and current 
              status of an item; in the world of 2050 an educated person also 
              knew a range of possible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s for that item. Many <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s have 
              been given for the addition of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>-oriented curricula in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. 
              Some argued that we were simply forced into it by the increasing

              the full range of global issues and opportunities. This contributed 
              to the improved conditions enjoyed in the mid-21st Century and expected 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations as well. </p>
<p>In addition to the popularization of executive training seminars 
              in long-term perspectives, the many National <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a>s Academies popularized 
              and improved the quality of instruction of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s studies through 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of universities. They helped integrate <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s, creative,

              The moral basis for decisions, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of risk, and dealing with 
              uncertainty were also integrated into these courses. <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s were converted into teaching <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s to help <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>-orient 
              instruction. </p>
<p>The millennium provided the focus to foster collaboration among 
              the various inter-religious dialogues on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> values and morals 
              that continued over several decades and through all forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. 
              This accelerated the inter-religious studies that found common moral 
              values and attitudes acceptable to all cultures. Religious leaders 
              publicly acknowledged the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> and value of a variety of approaches 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual enlightenment and becoming a virtuous person. These 
              public acknowledgments and dialogues helped to reduce the hatred 
              created by the many ethnic conflicts of the late 20th century. The 
              personal intervention of some religious leaders who condemned those 
              who called for violence in the name of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, reduced the use 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> as a justification for ethnic conflict. </p>
<p>Although cultural and religious conflicts will still need more 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to fully disappear, these new initiatives have help to keep 
              them in sufficient check to prevent the kinds of wars so prevalent 
              in the last century. </p>
<p>Philosophers and artists created terminology and imagery that communicated 
              the strength of <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> is its underlying unity and our ethical 
              responsibilities to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations. Global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> have become 
              generally understood and scientifically documented for social stability. 
              This did not mean that all people adhered to global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>, but 
              that it became a force for social stability. <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">Advertising</a> and social 
              marketing taught tolerance and respect for <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> and equal rights. 
              All managers today have received training courses in ethical behavior 
              in a multiethnic <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. As a result <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> globally includes 
              responsibility about global impacts. </p>
<p>Psychonauts exploring the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> and cybernauts exploring <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> 
              helped create new forms of notation and <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s that enabled the 
              general public to understand the sophisticated world of 2050. These 
              new forms made the global <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s more intelligible to 
              a broad range of people. These notations and <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s helped transcultural 
              collaboration in creating the cultures of peace we enjoy today. 
              Many of the new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> and ways of knowing 
              that helped this transition could only have emerged through <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              interaction using these new forms of notation. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">Diversity</a> and shared ethical values were encouraged by the countless 
              celebrations of humanity-as-a-whole at the millennium. People and 
              institutions learned the painful lessons generated by the many ethnic 
              conflicts that followed the fall of the USSR. Polycultural views 
              were created from shared beliefs and interests that enhanced peaceful 
              coexistence. Polyculturalism also helped smooth the transition of 
              nation-centric states to regional and global institutions. Global 
              economic success diminished the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of excessive materialistic 
              desires and people looked for more meaning in their lives. <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">Experience</a> 
              -- more than <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> -- became the key economic value. By 2050 
              enough people understood that ethnic <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> is a comparative 
              advantage in a global economy and <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, and has made our world 
              far more peaceful today than in the past. Diverse views from many 
              cultures provided the insights to manage an increasingly complex 
              world and shared ethical values promoted cooperation and stability.

<p>Changes in global frames of reference and philosophies due in part 
              to understanding of the interaction of population and economic <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              with environmental degradation gave rise to the more enlightened 
              age of today. The merger of the environmental movements and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              rights groups in collaboration with many leading multinational corporations 
              made possible the global <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al campaign that made clean air, 
              water, and land to be accepted as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> right. As a result, many 
              changes in environmental policies and behaviors have been made. 
              It became unthinkable to establish an environmentally dangerous 
              project. </p>
<p>In the late 20th century, it was scientifically documented that 
              the behavior and values of most astronauts changed as a result of 
              the "breakaway phenomena", the psychological reaction 
              to leaving <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. Seeing the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> caused psychological 
              and even neurological changes that created new neural connections 
              associated with the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of humanity; and, hence the value forming 
              process. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> became more compassionate with the 
              daily flood of images of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> from orbital communities, the lunar 
              base, and the Mars pioneers. Many of children born in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> have 
              developed careers related to conflict prevention and re-enforcing 
              the value of ethnic <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>. Their increasing interaction with 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>-based groups has provided a calming influence on potential 
              social conflicts. </p>
<p>Others believed that the increasingly aging population in the global 
              labor force helped to provide <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> for increasing ethical considerations 
              in business and daily <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Still others point to the NGO global 
              dialogs and studies on <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> that scrutinized and encouraged improvement 
              of ethical standards in business as the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for the more humane 
              use of free markets. </p>
<p>Whatever the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, the 20th century self-centered greed and 
              welfare attitudes were replaced by a more moral <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, environmental <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, and compassion. Growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d, energetic and active older men and women are respected 
              and occupy <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant positions shared with younger groups. The traditional 
              "linear <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>" where people pass from <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>,

              in need. Thanks to a variety of public and private options, social 
              security is robust. </p>
<p>Nearly all formerly less advantaged groups (the poor, the elderly, 
              women, ethnic and racial minorities) participate in the cyber cash 
              economy; universal literacy and <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> allows people to 
              learn and work at home. Poor women were especially helped by these 
              changes which contributed to decreases in infant <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> rates, 
              generated <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> support for childcare, contraceptives, and 
              family planning, as well as the powerful role models for women provided 
              by various <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. Inter-religious dialogs about the changing role 
              of women, birth control, and <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> were also credited with these 
              changes. Equal pay for equal work is now a universal norm. Disabled 
              persons are able to live functional lives and participate indiscriminately 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. </p>
<p>The interest in assessment of the past and visioning of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              became so popular at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the millennium that inquiry into 
              new and sometimes counter intuitive ideas became much more acceptable. 
              As a result, much more was learned about how to increase natural 
              abilities by self-control of inherent <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> healing power, cognitive 
              enhancing strategies, and conscious involvement with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> generated 
              artificial "life". </p>
<p>By the end of the 20th century, many norms underpinning peace were 
              widely accepted, such as territorial integrity, non-use of nuclear, 
              chemical, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, the immunity of civilian aircraft 
              and ships, international obligation to help refugees, the inadmissibility 
              of colonial rule, the unacceptableness of officially sanctioned 
              and racial discrimination, the undeniable equality of woman, and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> rights. But not until the world <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> became more 
              efficient, did these norms become almost universally perceived as 
              normal today. </p>
<p>The transitions from authoritarian regimes to democracies was smoothed 
              by advanced training <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and seminars for senior political 
              officials to discuss with their international peers successful transition 
              strategies in the areas of the rule of law, respect for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> rights, 
              free <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, tolerance of political opposition, free elections, and 
              an independent civil <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. </p>
<p>Because of the speed and ubiquity of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, decision-makers 
              and the general public became increasingly aware of the consequences 
              of their decisions -- almost as they occurred. Feedback on the results 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s is so rapid, which in turn allows for new, self-correcting 
              decisions. This has reduced the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> from early warnings to timely 
              and effective responses and contributed to the solution of many 
              of the seemly intractable problems of the 20th century. </p>
<p>Just as body building became fashionable among many in the late 
              20th century, so too <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> building has became fashionable in early

              Nutritional supplements known as "brain food" became common.

              the surface of Jupiter, or in an ant colony, when they are sitting

              people in the middle class by 2050. </p>
<p>The UN Secretariat's early warning and monitoring <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> coupled 
              with a new rapid response capability were <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al in preventing 
              international and internal wars. Its indicators of peace and security 
              are transparent for cross-referencing by <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, NGOs, 
              and the public. This transparency - especially with the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> - 
              connected early warning with appropriate and timely <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Instead 
              of a standing UN Army, nations agreed to identify troops which would 
              be immediately available for rapid response peacekeeping and peace 
              building missions which have been trained together with other such 
              national troops and which use compatible equipment and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. 
              NGOs cooperated with this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> by establishing <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s to monitor 
              indicators of conflict and discuss and link strategies for rapid 
              deployment of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> resources. States were able to reduce 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> budgets by paying a "security insurance fee" 
              to the UN Security Insurance Agency to work in tandem with UN Peacekeeping 
              as a rapid development and peace making contingents. The UNSIA was 
              able to avoid the veto by being governed by a public-private-civic 
              governing council that worked in partnership the UN Security Council. 
            </p>
<p>As a <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of global issues and the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people involved 
              in the decision-making process increased, institutions found new 
              approaches to management and decision making. Most hierarchical 
              institutions have evolved into <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> organizations and have increased 
              their public accountability, transparency, and participation in 
              management. Many <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> organizations have evolved into fields 
              of common interests as <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s cross political boundaries <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally, 
              making new alliances unbeknownst to traditional power. </p>
<p>The UN Secretariat and Security Council has been streamlined and 
              is now supported by advanced executive <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> management <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> agents, and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> visualization <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Nearly all 
              the work of UN now occurs in "Cyber UN," leaving the Secretariat 
              building in New York more for ceremonial duties. Some of UN's specialized 
              agencies have been merged while others have increased in <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance 
              like the WTO, WHO, WSO (World Sustainable-development Organization), 
              and INSPACO. These global institutions have harmonized international 
              standards, protocols, and coordination among international organizations, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, corporations, and NGOs. Both multi-national corporations 
              and NGOs have become transnational in their policy influence. Regional 
              institutions have also grown in <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance. </p>
<p>The transition from dictatorships to democracies is now complete. 
              Authoritarian regimes cooperated in the transition realizing that 
              democratic processes were increasingly necessary for social stability 
              and the generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> en par with global norms. Improved 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> helped make UN Electoral Units <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al 
              in this transition by providing effective election design, management, 
              and monitoring. Threats to make development assistance and loans 
              from international organizations dependent on <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward democracy 
              sometimes proved counterproductive. The incentive of participation 
              in the Global Partnership for Development (GPD) proved effective 
              as a partnership between high income countries and those with less 
              industrial and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ial cultures to improve economic development. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/gdp_entry.html">GDP</a> membership required respect for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> rights and policies to 
              address environmental security. If they were abridged or thwarted 
              sufficiently, intervention by UN peacekeeping forces could be authorized 
              by the Security Council. A little noticed article in the GPD called 
              for acceptance of periodic NGO assessments of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> on democratization 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of corruption. The corruption reports have become 
              an annually anticipated <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> and have proven to be an effective 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> through which countries have reduced corruption. </p>
<p>As the world <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed toward peace, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in arms R&amp;D, 
              production, stockpiling, trade, and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> personnel was accelerated 
              along with the efforts to convert <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to civilian 
              uses. This contributed to <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> debt <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>. The synergies 
              of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering necessary

              for universal <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. This helped to justify <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> 
              investment into <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> that lowered launch costs. While <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> 
              funds for the initial solar power satellites, orbital habitats for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> manufacturing, lunar base, and the Martian station were necessary, 
              the majority of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> applications are financed and owned by global 
              corporations, INSPACECO, or a combination of both. </p>
<p>The International Criminal Court was established with enforcement 
              powers to punish those convicted of atrocious collective and communal 
              violence. In close cooperation with the court, the UN Secretariat 
              created a parallel early warning <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> focusing on potential and 
              emerging crime threats. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> became a right of citizenship as <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s realized 
              that it was a logical extension of the public library. Telecommunication 
              monopolies were replaced by local, regional, and global enterprises 
              as new technological capacities were introduced. <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">Content</a> and use 
              of international <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s are regulated as little as possible, although

              prevents the reception of offensive materials to those groups. Imbedded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> strengthened the enforcement of <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>

<p>Participatory processes informed by <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> continue to 
              develop and improve national and <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> visions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. 
              Socio-cultural indicators were developed to improve analysis. The 
              interaction of these indicators with global scientific, economic, 
              political and environmental factors is now standard. This led to 
              the creation of the common protocols used at regional intergovernmental 
              meetings and countries to share their <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s perspectives and communicate 
              the implications of decisions to the public. </p>
<p>NGOs contributed to confidence building, conflict resolution and 
              preventive diplomacy. NGOs are now regularly included in decision 
              making of international organizations. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and integration of regional trade groups has nearly 
              completed the transition to the WTO <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive of free trade with 
              common standards of behavior. The <a class="thought" href="entries/globalization_entry.html">globalization</a> of markets, <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, urbanization, and the harmonization 
              of international standards seem to be sufficient to prevent regression 
              to dictatorships and national wars. The IMF issued new SDRs (Special 
              Drawing Rights) that made it easier for developing countries to 
              pay off their debt. Standard central bank rules were finally observed 
              by all countries on the issuance of currency, which now helps controls 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>. The Global Securities and Exchange Commission was established 
              to tame currency markets and central banks made currency transactions 
              sufficiently transparent to reduce speculation. Small business was 
              promoted through <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to land, credit, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and training. 
              Special attention was given to women. </p>
<p>Increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of people now accept that <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> not possession 
              is the measure of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>. This new cultural norm helped to change 
              consumption <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. Global dialogs about <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> and common values 
              have helped the New <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">Wealth</a> Indicators (NWI) which replaced <a class="thought" href="entries/gdp_entry.html">GDP</a> as 
              the primary focus for national accounting. This has stimulated more 
              ethical and free markets. The increasing participation of those 
              65-85 in the labor force provided additional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> for increasing 
              ethical considerations in business. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">Entrepreneur</a>ial <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> and stewardship replaced the welfare attitude. 
              Employee ownership is now common in the many forms of Employee Stock

<p>NGOs identified, monitored, and publicized sources of the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              to free markets and unethical business practices around the world. 
              Participatory processes between labor, management, and consumers 
              helped better match training and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> work to keep employment 
              high. Public voting on political elections and potential <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> 
              decisions of global <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance via global <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s has become a 
              common practice. A side benefit was the continual identification 
              and acknowledgment of the many hidden and delayed costs assumed 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>, which in turn lead to the acceptance of full cost

              of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> more democratically than previous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> 
              money made international commerce more secure, which allowed instant

              to the development process. </p>
<p>The Great Cyber Games helped to distribute the workload from those 
              who were overloaded to the underemployed. The cyber game's Work 
              Unit allowed people to bid on work from the overloaded. </p>
<p>Although the 1999 World Conference on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> was not initially 
              hailed as a great success, it did initiate the discussions that 
              laid the foundations for the political agreements to create and 
              accept the UNESCO-ICSU definitions of terms, standards, and measurements 
              that proved necessary for effective political and economic polices 
              that eventually achieved sustainable development by the mid-21st 
              century. The use of environmental tax incentives, product labels, 
              and international sanctions on violators of a series of UN treaties 
              related to sustainable development required these scientifically 
              determined definitions and measures. With these changes in policy 
              and an increasingly informed global market, businesses competed 
              to show their environment correctness. The more successful companies 
              got a jump on the competition by creating their own labeling <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s 
              prior to <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> policies. </p>
<p>Although "sustainable development" had become the most 
              internationally accepted goal for humanity, it was not realized 
              until several powerful personalities provided the spark to move 
              the world from "lip service" to more serious <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Companies 
              created their own green labels as competitive advantage with those 
              who didn't use environmentally sound production practices. Consumer 
              groups helped the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and service companies find the industrial 
              supplies and products for their businesses that were created in 
              more ecologically sound ways. "Green" producers and consumers 
              united in political movements that changed waste-subsidizing economic 
              policies. (For example, providers began charging for the real costs 
              of water, nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> costs, etc.). The global inter-religious 
              discourses helped to make <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably clean air, water, and healthy 
              soil a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> right rather than a factor in economic cost/benefit 
              analysis. </p>
<p>The World Sustainable-development Organization (WSO) was created 
              to provide a global focus for business, <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              efforts to invest into sustainable development. The International 
              Court of Environmental Arbitration and Conciliation has become the 
              key <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> for advising the UN Security Council on environmental 
              security <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. UN Peacekeeping forces were deployed when the 
              ICEAC ruled against a state that was unwilling to stop the leakage 
              of nuclear waste that endangered several countries. Since then the 
              threat of UN <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> intervention has been sufficient to cause 
              remedial <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. Intergenerational equity has become a major global 
              value and legal principle. </p>
<p>The WSO provided a global collection point for contributions and 
              investments into alternative sources of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> storage, 
              and efficiencies to extend non-renewable <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> sources. In response 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>, it worked with oil companies to help them expand 
              into renewable <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> sources. It also provided political leadership 
              for INSPACO to place <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> rectennas for solar power satellites 
              in China and India during the first round of receiving countries 
              to reduce by WSO helped local authorities in cooperation with farmers, 
              agribusinesses, and environmental NGOs provide natural habitat corridors 
              and integration of habitat in agriculture to protect biodiversity. 
              WSO's collaboration with local authorities helped them <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> goals 
              or limits for percent of land-use for natural pristine reserves, 
              low intensity agriculture, and high intensity agriculture. </p>
<p>Ecological and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> taxes were initiated to create disincentives 
              for inappropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> use and tax incentives for less polluting 
              alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> sources. All stages of the production process 
              were included (extraction, production, distribution and consumption). 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">Corporate</a>-NGO partnerships developed model sustainable communities 
              in different settings around the world that were designed around 
              reduced consumerism, sustainability, community values, traffic-free,

              developed to compensate victims of pollution and other environmental 
              damage. Tradeable pollution permits were used to insure international 
              compliance to fix global emission limits for countries and industrial 
              sectors. With broad public support, <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s entered into voluntary

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I enjoyed reading this article, it was very optimistic and gave many insightful ideas. In particular I liked the theme that humans had evolved much further than we are right now to try to use equitably resolution processes &amp; mitigate violence.
<br>
<br>
It gives a bit of a carrot at the end of a stick feeling. I want to move towards these values.
<br>
<br>
However, in light of recent events, I think we are going in the opposie direction right now. The recent move by the Bush administration to increase the use of small tactical nuclear weapons on a first strike basis is not in keeping with the theme of this article.
<br>
<br>
If all the world leaders stood up and said we renounce nuclear weapons, and Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson &amp; a "Khomeini" said we completely renounce violence and accept other belief systems (and birth control) then we might be on to something. 
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I agree with Ray that some technologies might move MUCH faster than others mentioned. 
<br>
<br>
In the 60's, many of the original computer inventors &amp; internet people were "hippies" who wanted equality. In reality, many sold out for the big $ and computers are mostly used by business to make more money.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>James, you are totally mistaken, the only way to achieve to a new feudalism is socialism and other authoritarian political governments. And they don't need technology to be powerful. People could be oppressed or killed with or without technology.
<br>
<br>
Technology is our hope for the future. It will make us healthier, wealthier and the most important it will make us freer and independent.
<br>
<br>
If we compare our history background is easy to see the impact of technology in our society. Not long ago, life was rough and people died at young ages. In most families, children death was very common, intensifying specially in those who had low income. 
<br>
<br>
It's easy to see how much had grown population since the industrial revolution, and that's not because people was manufactured with machinery!!, that's because the technology sustained the life of millions, much more than before. If we took out all technology and pretend to live in the way our grand parents lived, most of the people would die soon of starvation. They are living thanks to technology.
<br>
<br>
Technology makes our lives wealthier. It's easy to see the difference between the reach and the poor. The only thing the poor need to develop themselves its technology. It's really a pity that there are political and ideological frontiers when the solution it out there, much more closer than they expect.
<br>
<br>
I don't really understand why there are people arguing against technology while they are living in a city and using it's new PENTIUM IV for navigating in internet and posting a e-message in a forum. There are thousands of places on earth were technology had not reached yet, where they could go to live. They are free to do whatever they like. Living with or without technology, is just their option.
<br>
<br>
There is no point in saying that the technology developed in the future will have a negative impact, when  the overall result (good and bad uses) is that technology  made of our environment a much better place to live.

<br>
<br>
Technology doesnt make anybody a penny wealthier, or poorer. Its how our economics makes use of technology that is really the key.
<br>
What technology does is allow goods to be produced cheaper, by using less human labor. The cheaper the goods, the more people can afford them.
<br>
But you get to a point where the cost of this outweighs the benefits.
<br>
Too many of the things that it once took human labor to do become mechanized, too many people are put out of work by the ever-rising tide of mechanization, not many can afford to buy the items produced by computerized factories, businesses begin to collapse, etc. 
<br>
I remember thinking twenty years ago that computerization would save so much labor that people would work thirty, twenty, or even less hours a week around the year 2000. In fact we are working longer hours for less money. I am beginning to wonder if we have seen the costs of industrialization outweigh the benefits. So have we reached the "point of diminshing returns?"</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;&gt;Too many of the things that it once took human labor to do become mechanized, too many people are put out of work by the ever-rising tide of mechanization, not many can afford to buy the items produced by computerized factories, businesses begin to collapse, etc.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
This spectre has been haunting us since the beginning of the industrial revolution.  Heretofore, productivity increases have freed capital to fund more innovation, which has been responsible for creating new work for people to do.  Railroads put cart drivers out of work.  Automobiles put most blacksmiths out of work.  And so forth and so on.  
<br>
<br>
Of course, just because this has been the way it's worked for the last 200 years is no guarantee that it will continue to work that way, but, on the other hand, there is no realistic alternative.  Genies are difficult to put back into bottles; And in any event, the earth could not support the current population of the earth without modern technology.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I remember thinking twenty years ago that computerization would save so much labor that people would work thirty, twenty, or even less hours a week around the year 2000. In fact we are working longer hours for less money. I am beginning to wonder if we have seen the costs of industrialization outweigh the benefits. So have we reached the "point of diminshing returns?"&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
What the technology did was make workplaces more productive.   Humans choose how to deal with those productivity increases.  In fact, if an American wanted to live the lifestyle of a 1950s-era middle class family, he/she could do so on about half the average per capita income of today, and, conceivably, on a 20 hour work week.  But "wants" accumulate, and soon they becme needs.  (The size of the average American's dwelling has nearly doubled in size since the 1960s.  Middle class Americans demand the ability to buy strawberries out of season.    Etc ad nauseum).

Bob&gt;&gt;&gt; True, no technology has made human labor redundant so far, but no technology can duplicate all human capabilities, across the board...yet. But with artificial intelligence, this will be realized.
<br>
A.I. and its robotic physical extensions are in a different realm completely than automobiles and railroads, from a business applications standpoint. 
<br>
Any new technology developed by capital freed-up from dumping the human workforce will only create more demand for A.I.

<br>
     One major reason why Americans, in particular, feel squeezed, is that the way average folks consume.  In the 1950s, very few US households had any significant debt, beyond a mortgage, and (perhaps) a car payment. Installment credit card debt was extremely rare. Housing costs were lower for the average American--but the average American took up about half the square footage he/she does today.  Food costs were about the same in real terms, proportionally, but the marketbasket contained different items...less convenience food.  If one shopped like the average household in 1957, your food costs would probably fall by nearly half.  Etc Etc Etc.

No, I would say that for many people, credit card debt is an acceptable price to pay to live a certain lifestyle, one, which on a pay-as-you-go basis would be out of reach for them.  However, it is possible to choose to live without some of the gadgets we have surrounded ourselves with and, thereby cut back on stress, if one doesn't have a super-high income.  Most of us choose not to do that, however.

Dear Bob
<br>
<br>
If what you have written was correct and techno-economics worked as you described, how high would it be unemployment rate nowadays? 70?, 95%???
<br>
<br>
mmmmm, unemployment rate is well below, there is something mistaken in your logic.
<br>
<br>
Imagine we would go in the opposite way, replacing new technology with the old one, and doing things in the way was previously done. What would you say?
<br>
<br>
<br>
It would probably be similar to this:
<br>
<br>
-------
<br>
<br>
What a disaster!! They are replacing cars with horses! How is going to work the people who depended of cars and trucks? And what about the ones who worked in buses and gas stations?
<br>
<br>
Look! how many jobs are being destroyed!
<br>
What will do people who lived from aeronautics and electronic equipment?
<br>
<br>
Oh no!!! There are thousands of people who depends of communications, computers, tourism, television, radios and trains. What are they going to do now!!!!
<br>
<br>
This world is going to helllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>
--------
<br>
<br>
What happens to you it that you are seeing only one side of the whole. It's easier to notice how many jobs were replaced with new technology, but it's a bit harder to notice how many the new technology created.
<br>
<br>
That's because when an old factory or activity closes, all people that worked there are fired at the same time in the same place (and some of them appear on TV). But in the meanwhile new techno companies are employing people at a unnoticeable continuous rate dispersed all around the world. That easily surpasses the fired people that you read yesterday in the newspaper.
<br>
<br>
And there is another thing you didn't notice, the fact is that the number of different economics activities had multiplied over time, thanks to new technologies (and surely they are doing in an exponential rate). So, it doesn't matter if the number employed people in one activity had decreased over time. It's simply, there are much more things to do.
<br>
<br>
                                (new) - (old) &gt;&gt; 0
<br>
<br>
And if the growth of new tasks is increasing in an exponential way, as kurzweil theories, there will be a time not in a distant future where it will not only be a technological singularity, but also a tasks singularity, in which there would be so many different types of works, that all people of the world would be insufficient to occupy all the existing jobs. (Hey Kurzweil here is a new theory!!).
<br>
<br>
Making some calculations, if one day our world economy had 1 million different tasks, if each one employed ONLY 6000 people all round the Earth, then, there would be no more people left for new jobs.
<br>
<br>
 6 billion / #(types of tasks) = #(people in each one)
<br>
<br>
Try if you can get better results.
<br>
<br>
What had happened until now was that the growth speed of population was higher than the new tasks creation, and that's why in this moment there is still unemployed people. But, try to see if you can in a world of 6 billion people give work to everybody with rudimentary tech. It would be almost impossible.
<br>
<br>
But, it doesn't ends there, new tasks creation has a more accelerated growth and someday it would not only reach the velocity of population growth, but it will also surpass it. The demand of people will surpass the supply, and for businessmen unemployment will be only a wish.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Now that manufacturing is being taken over by machines and outsourcing to countries like China, the U.S. is specializing in services as the greatest source of employment.  I.e., instead of making things, we now spend our time selling things to each other.  Now the Internet is putting big stores out of business, but putting people to work transporting goods from central locations to people's homes and offices.  
<br>
<br>
For a long time, movies were the only employment for actors.  Now television comes up with 500 channels and the number of jobs producing product to feed that need has multiplied exponentially.  
<br>
<br>
Fishermen are being driven out of business by the depletion of fish from the ocean.  Now the business of selling fish has turned to fish farming.  
<br>
<br>
At one time in my lifetime, if you didn't work for somebody, you starved to death.  Now the government supports anyone who doesn't have a job, at least for a while.  When machines and computers manufacture everything, what people make will take on greater value.  
<br>
<br>
You have to ask yourself, "What is money?"  It's just a medium of exchange by which people can trade what they have for what they want.  It can be anything, and often is.  A man builds a company and needs money to expand it.  He turns to other humans and says "I will give you a piece of my company if you will give me the funds with which to expand it."  So he prints up a million or so pieces of paper and says, "Each piece of paper is worth one millionth of my company."  People trade their money for his paper and "stock" is born.  Stock is now exchanged just like money.  Time Warner was bought by AOL for stock as a medium of exchange.  But all anybody got was the IDEA of value and a piece of paper saying they owned something.  What the paper is worth depends on how much somebody else wants it.
<br>
<br>
No matter how much the machines take over, people will always have something somebody else wants.  The mind of man will invent ways to make that exchange happen.  If machines are feeding you, clothing you, housing you and making all of the things you need, your neighbor will have something you don't have and you will come up with something to exchange for it.  
<br>
<br>
Knowledge is a commodity we now exchange over the Internet.  Money is being replaced by electronic transfers.  Value is being exchanged by the mere thought of wanting something.  At some point, you will no longer need a buck in the sense of something you can hold in your hand.
<br>
<br>
Look at what is happening now in gas stations and fast food establishments.  You fill up the gas tank in your car and buy some food at the little market that collects the money.  But what do they collect?  You wave a card or a key chain over the cash register and voila, money has been taken from your account and deposited in the account of the owner of the gas station and the market.  Soon everything will be done that way.  Money will someday be a museum piece like the first computer I owned 30 years ago.  
<br>
<br>
So how we make a buck will boil down to the many ways we can find to create something somebody else wants.  The options are endless.  Our time, our ideas, our posessions are all for sale to the highest bidder.  The government is the employer of last resort.  If you can't invent or sell anything, the government will still provide you with the necessities of life -- the idea of money in the form of electronic impulses from their computer to your bank's.  
<br>
<br>
That's how I get paid right now.  It's called Social Security.  In exchange for my lifetime of feeding the government in the form of taxes and government service, the government is now feeding me in the form of electronic messages to my bank which increase the money in my account.  The number of bucks the government can manufacture in this way is infinite.  The human mind merely has to find ways to turn them into something we can use or exchange.  
<br>
<br>
Last night I used them to get a man to crawl under my house and fix a leaky water pipe.  This morning we're both happy.  He has money and I have water.

<br>
<br>
Jeremy&gt;Im fully aware that money does not have to be green pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents on it. 
<br>
But anyhow, you seem to be suggesting that people will still be employed through three options:
<br>
1- We will provide services to others, trade our time and skills for their money, or whatever they have that we want. I think this is totally unrealistic. Why pay an expensive human to do what a machine could do for much cheaper. Not to mention faster, and with far fewer mistakes. 
<br>
2-People will live via a giant welfare state, or as Thomas calls it, "a giveaway economy". But if everything is given away, why would anyone own a company? The government would have to oversee all means of production. The "everyone gets a fancy car" idea sounds logical on the surface, but if everyone has such a car, it wont be fancy. 
<br>
The housing markets effect on the enviornment would be distatrous. We cant all have seaside mansions. Somehow we would have to decide who gets to live where, and in what. I assume AI would make that decision, along with many many others. 
<br>
Since AI will be solely responsible for running the economy, our lives will depend on it. And since it will advance in intelligence to a point far beyond our own very quickly, we wont understand how we are being supported. Humanity will resemble AIs pets.
<br>
3-Only slightly less bleak, you seem to say that we could live off buying stocks in the computerized companies. But I also dont think this is an option. A few years ago I invested a few thousand dollars, and hoped to double my money in a few years. Even if the best had happened, and I had doubled it, it still would not be near enough to live on. But the best hasnt happened, and I have lost about a third. In such an economy a setback like what we have seen in the last few years would result in a downward spiral nearly impossible to come out of. 
<br>
But I would like to say thanks for some intelligent conversation Grant, even though I disagree with you on everything. This mind exchange forum seems to have lots of loonies and jerks who only want to harrass people, so its good to talk to someone who is actually concerned with a relevant issue. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Grant&gt;You have to ask yourself, "What is money?" 
<br>
<br>
Jeremy&gt;Im fully aware that money does not have to be green pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents on it. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;But anyhow, you seem to be suggesting that people will still be employed through three options: 
<br>
<br>
&gt;1- We will provide services to others, trade our time and skills for their money, or whatever they have that we want. I think this is totally unrealistic. Why pay an expensive human to do what a machine could do for much cheaper. Not to mention faster, and with far fewer mistakes. 
<br>
<br>
There are several areas here where you seem to misunderstand my meaning.  I'm talking about human nature -- a nature in which people want what they don't have, now matter how ludicrous it may seem.  When machines are making perfect things, people will want the less perfect items made by other humans.  The Japanese, for example, have a yen for pottery and such that are strangely shaped.  They have artificial cracks in the glaze and no two pieces look exactly alike.  They refer to this as having "character."  What machine would think of body piercing as a way of making oneself attractive?  Humans will find ways to create things that other humans want but machines can't imagine.  
<br>
<br>
That's because we are unique in our culture and our culture changes as a rate that defies capture.  We have a sense of time that gives our lives meaning based on what we do with the time we spend on earth.  We will always find and value ways of using time -- something only we can do.  
<br>
<br>
Look at football.  People start learning the art of sports, especially football, in early childhood.  They go through primary, high school and college perfecting their ability to play in competition with other humans.  When they make it to the pros, they get paid more money than the president of the U.S.  In other words, that skill and that ability is valued highly.  Millions or billions of people pay to see other people do it.  How many people will watch the Superbowl this Sunday?  How many people will be employed by it and get paid for allowing the rest of the world to see it?  What machine will be able to duplicate it, no matter how intelligent?  We pay to watch people compete with other people and we glory in the ability of those who do it best.  
<br>
<br>
Sure, machines can knock down humans and advance a football 100 yards faster and more irresistably than any human.  But so what?  Who would pay to see them do it?  What we're paying for is a chance to participate in something uniquely human.  As machines take over more and more of what we produce, people will devise new ways of investing their time and energy that most will find satisfying.  Football is now a product, manufactured and sold around the world.  So is basketball, golf, tennis, soccer, and even the racing of cars.  This is just one example of things people find to do with their time and energy that they weren't able to do before we created machines to do our manufacturing for us.  The more machines take over, the more things people will find to do that they never imagined doing before.
<br>
<br>
&gt;2-People will live via a giant welfare state, or as Thomas calls it, "a giveaway economy". But if everything is given away, why would anyone own a company? The government would have to oversee all means of production. The "everyone gets a fancy car" idea sounds logical on the surface, but if everyone has such a car, it wont be fancy. 
<br>
<br>
I don't think people will run companies anymore.  AI will do it.  The government will provide transportation because it will be beyond the ability of people to cope with the complexity of it.  And machines will be what government relies upon to get the job done.  But look for mass transit to take over in ways we don't expect.  Instead of everyone owning a car, we may have cars available to us on a scheduled basis because there won't be room on the roads for everyone to drive around in his/her own car.  Sort of like a universal motor pool.  Or a taxi service with intelligent cars that take us wherever we need to go.  We'll pay for them with the money we save by not buying cars every year or two.  
<br>
<br>
&gt;The housing markets effect on the enviornment would be distatrous. We cant all have seaside mansions. Somehow we would have to decide who gets to live where, and in what. I assume AI would make that decision, along with many many others. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;Since AI will be solely responsible for running the economy, our lives will depend on it. And since it will advance in intelligence to a point far beyond our own very quickly, we wont understand how we are being supported. Humanity will resemble AIs pets. 
<br>
<br>
You're right -- we can't all have seaside manions.  But we will have affordable housing because people do need a place to live.  And the cost will be reasonable because machines will build them for us.  As always, some people will live better than others because they will find ways to make more money than others.  The people with the most money will get the best housing.  If this were a communist government, the people with the best connections within the government would get the best housing.  There will always be a way of basing privelege on contribution.  It will depend on what people value and are willing to pay for in one way or another.  Some people will always work harder than others; be smarter than others; have better connections than others; and so on.  But politics will always be human because machines don't care about who gets what.  They don't compete.  They just perform.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;3-Only slightly less bleak, you seem to say that we could live off buying stocks in the computerized companies. But I also dont think this is an option. A few years ago I invested a few thousand dollars, and hoped to double my money in a few years. Even if the best had happened, and I had doubled it, it still would not be near enough to live on. But the best hasnt happened, and I have lost about a third. In such an economy a setback like what we have seen in the last few years would result in a downward spiral nearly impossible to come out of. 
<br>
<br>
You are seeing the world in terms of the past rather than the future here.  We won't be AI's pets.  We will be partners in the job of taking care of the earth and running it in a way that will support all of us.  As individuals, we will be less than AI in intelligence.  But as a culture we will be as big and as bright as the machines.  In fact, we will be part of the governing intelligence because we will be plugged into it and contributing our own knowledge and abilities to the mass intelligence that runs the planet.  What the internet evolves into will be what runs the world and we will all be part of that.  Just as a single ant is stupid in comparison to the ant colony, a human is relatively stupid compared to the culture we have spawned and that intelligence is growing at the same speed as that of machines.  In fact, we are growing in tandem with each other.  Some day you will find it hard to distinguish human and machine intelligence because they will be so integrated with each other.  
<br>
<br>
Kurzweil got it right when he said we will take a layer of nanotechnology on top of our human brains just as we did the crebral cortex on top of the simpler brains that lie beneath the surface on top of our spines.  The human brain is built of layers that go back to worms that crawled in the sea and then lizzards that walked on land and finally mammals that live on both land and sea.  You can cut through a brain and see the same kinds of evolutionary levels you find in the Grand Canyon or any other part of earth's crust.  We don't cast aside the elements we grew out of.  We incorprate them into the next thing we evolve into.  
<br>
<br>
So when you posit that we will still be the same people we were -- with the same hangups of industrial age thinking -- you are not taking into consideration the way evolution works.  We are not the apes our ancestors were nor will our progeny be the half-apes we are now.  The man/machine will become the organism that runs earth and keeps it livable, just as the human body is the organism that one-celled animals evolved into so that a several trillion of them could live as a single unit.  The cells are still there.  They are just organized into something greater than themselves.  So it will be with whatever it is man and machine organize themselves into.
<br>
<br>
&gt;But I would like to say thanks for some intelligent conversation Grant, even though I disagree with you on everything. This mind exchange forum seems to have lots of loonies and jerks who only want to harrass people, so its good to talk to someone who is actually concerned with a relevant issue. 
<br>
<br>
I enjoyed the give and take myself.  It helped me organize my thoughts and answer some questions I hadn't come to grips with before.  
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>
<br>
Grant

<br>
mmmmm, unemployment rate is well below, there is something mistaken in your logic. 
<br>
<br>
Bob&gt;&gt;&gt;Thats not necessarily my logic. Did you read the follow-up messages? 
<br>
<br>
And there is another thing you didn't notice, the fact is that the number of different economics activities had multiplied over time, thanks to new technologies (and surely they are doing in an exponential rate). 
<br>
<br>
Bob&gt;&gt;&gt; Im fully aware of that. However machines that can think, and can do any physical task a human can do will change this.  After reading a lot about a A.I. and the improved robotics we will see in coming decades, why hire humans at all when you can have machines do it much cheaper and faster? Read the follow-ups.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Can't help feeling that it predicts a streamlined kind of flow for all events to come. Like a well wrote, confortable to hear, kind of story.
<br>
<br>
It is my understanding that can't be a one global future, as there isn't one global present. We have areas (Countries, if you like), were people is scanned by magnetic devices and transported by helicopters to health center. And, at this very moment, we also have people unable to get electricity in their houses or worst. 
<br>
<br>
Technology, education, health and wealth are goods, that will be (as they are now), controlled and manipulated by the Empire-like entities of the future (pick your fav: Countries, Corporations, Space-Invaders...). 
<br>
<br>
Another point that sounds funny is that it made me feel like if we're right now struggling with problems and difficulties to solve, and then, by 2050, we'll have (finally), it all figured out and solved, and then (and only then), we'll start to live. We're right now living the 2050 of 1950 (or, perhaps 1900, taking into account Mr. Kurzweil's law of accelerating returns). We ARE right now in a future, filled with difficulties to deal with. I believe 2050 will be no different from this, no matter what shape it takes.
<br>
<br>
Human beings are notorious, never-resting trouble makers. We do enjoy action and the challenges posed to us by nature (ours, Universe's, other's). We can't live in a state of "I finally got it and it's all solved now". 
<br>
<br>
I believe we'll just find new ways (more complicated, more defiant, perhaps even more dangerous) to put us to test, and keep on dreaming (and only dreaming), about the future peace to come.

<br>
solid analysis, draco.
<br>
<br>
when one acknowledges this, the essential continuity of human beings (as well as the plethora of institutions created by these real human beings) can be used to craft a more realistic future
<br>
<br>
its funny, positing 'better, more improved humanity' is a great approach for selling books, but the real future has little to do with this shade of delusional thinking
<br>
<br>
things get shaky quickly, and all of a sudden you have moronic, alien humans unrecognizable to any human now extant, or that was ever extant
<br>
<br>
this is the real secret of my predictions - that in some ways, the most impt ways, they actually are quite conservative
<br>
<br>
when u look 50-100 yrs into the future, w the understanding of these future selves gained by simply reaching within oneself, and of course the nature of the world today as it is, and really how little that has changed in most ways in the last 50-100 yrs, progress can be made
<br>
<br>
tech advances are dazzling, but an overfocus on that alone does not lead to a convincing future
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100203221526/http://predictionboy.blogspot.com/2008/03/index.html" target="_blank">http://predictionboy.blogspot.com/2008/03/index.ht  ml</a>
<br>
from "Processing the Future":
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> The components that go into the process of predicting the future can be summarized as follows:
<br>
<br>
First and foremost, bring an open mind. Leave preconceptions of the future at the door, they contaminate the productive execution of the process. With an open mind you can go to the future with a clean slate, and see things that may surprise you.
<br>
<br>
Technological ' based on past and present trends, the likely rate of advance of the technologies needed for the applications and products discussed. I will sometimes give estimated times of arrival for these techs, but often the range is quite wide, because many depend on the continued advancement and convergence of many different technologies, each with their own rates of advance and market dynamics.
<br>
<br>
Consumer demand ' this is the pull for the techs discussed. This is both the likely adoption and/or lack thereof based on past and present trends. One of the key consumer demand trends that I use as an organizing principle is the 'imagination actualization' trend I will describe shortly.
<br>
<br>
Market dynamics ' the assumption that these products will be manufactured in the most cost-effective way to meet consumer demand, while being subject to the same forces as today, i.e. liability considerations, etc.
<br>
<br>
Legal, Ethical, and Moral ' this is often overlooked, but the law will still be around in the future, and will be a hugely motivating force to the presumably large corporate entities making most of these products. Then as now, these firms will have substantial liability considerations that will maximize their attention to making products that are safe and controllable, while meeting the richness of consumer demand. Many of the ethical dilemmas encountered here are almost as strange as the technology itself, as we'll get into in another post.
<br>
<br>
Most of the predictions that I've seen seem to take just one or two of these components and consider them in relative isolation. This can provide an interesting perspective on the future, but tends to drape them in vagueness, and though I'm often excited afterwards, always have a bunch of gnawing questions. However, when considered holistically, as a set of interacting, loosely coupled drivers, using one to decide which path to choose at a fork in the road reached with another, predictions can become dramatically more specific and detailed, while remaining quite reasonable.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>excellent draco
<br>
<br>
altho much different in character, rk was certainly an inspiration to my thoughts
<br>
<br>
but not the singularity, not transhumanism, not the computronium universe
<br>
<br>
rks thoughts on the continuing impact of multiplying computational power, moores law basically, where will that really take us
<br>
<br>
i read spiritual machines, and pondered that point for 5 years, turning the coin over and over and over
<br>
<br>
(on top of a previous 25 yrs of thinking abt the future - a lot.)
<br>
<br>
looking at how the entire history of technology has progressed, while very carefully making allowances that yes, ai is a special tech, can lead to some groundbreaking insights: 
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100203221526/http://predictionboy.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-ai-will-really-be-like.html" target="_blank">http://predictionboy.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-ai-  will-really-be-like.html</a>
<br>
<br>
and then very soberly look around at the state of that AI software, challenges can be seen:
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100203221526/http://predictionboy.blogspot.com/2007/09/wheres-all-ai-anyway.html" target="_blank">http://predictionboy.blogspot.com/2007/09/wheres-a  ll-ai-anyway.html</a>
<br>
<br>
this is why i think 'human level ai in 10 or 20 yrs' is unrealistic. i hope its in 10 or 20 yrs, i hope theres a breakthru there, but really, 50 or 100 yrs would be a better bet, if u were laying money on the table
<br>
<br>
a big, giant challenge that im not sure is entirely appreciated is that we wont be able (i dont believe) to create a microprocessor with the hardware complexity of the human brain, and have that chip start thinking and acting like a human
<br>
<br>
there will be need to be software as well, that essentially makes explicit in software what is implicit in our biological brain, ie, how to think</p></td>

i had actually entirely forgotten abt these tenets of rk's prediction portfolio, until i came here last yr and became reacquainted with them (after the main body of my prediction framework was established)
<br>
<br>
lack of awareness of these was a positive for my predictions
<br>
<br>
and since ive been here, i have been objectively deconstructing some of the fundamental assumptions underlying these ideas
<br>
<br>
the singularity, or what i call the hyperintelligence explosion, has some particularly cogent thoughts around it:

an excerpt from that blog thread:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> The persepective of this blog is that any any hyperintelligence 'explosion', should that scenario be proven to be realistic, will take a finite amount of time to complete (not vanishingly small), for the following reasons:
<br>
<br>
1. Unless the hyperintelligence is infinitely great, the time to solve any problem will be finite, not instantaneous.
<br>
<br>
2. Even if the design, theoretical, and scientific problems can be resolved in an instant by one of these advanced droids, the engineering actualization will still be of finite duration. In other words, unless these droids are capable of the instantaneous transmutation of matter, factory lines will still need to be retooled, etc, to create the more improved design.
<br>
<br>
3. These will take the form of consumer and/or business products, and people and businesses have very definitely finite abilities to absorb new offerings (even in the future)
<br>
<br>
4. Humans will still be in charge. For the purposes of this unbounded improvement cycle, even assuming maximum autonomy by the advanced AI tech, humans will still at the very least select the feature sets that are improved in this way.
<br>
<br>
5. The form of the droid intelligence will be such that self-motivated autonomy will be as alien to them as it is to PCs today ' regardless of the level of that intelligence, it's nature is fundamentally alien to these type of id-driven characteristics.
<br>
<br>
6. The nature of the improvements to the identified feature sets won't be a computationally bound problem, but one requiring intense interaction between humans and droids. In particular, the deepening sophistication of hyperobservancy and/or super-subtlety skills. </p></center> </p></td>

im reading this article, fascinating

here is a brilliant computer scientist, who is getting almost everything wrong abt the nature of future ai
<br>
<br>
this is such an interesting problem. when almost everyone contemplates future ai, the first thing they do, rk, bill joy, almost everyone, the first thing they do is jump inside their own head, see whats going on there, and assume ai will be exactly like that.

prior to this 'postulate', bill joy should have analyzed more carefully what's in our head, ie, the nature of human intelligence, and how much of that is likely, desirable, or wise to include in advanced ai systems.

Never said he was right, of course.  I just said we had to compare the two articles.

<br>
Given his postulate, everything he writes follows pretty well, provided that A then B.  Over here we see "assume humanity does X, Y, and Z, then because of that we get Q, M, and V" ignoring the fact that X, Y, and Z are completely in violation of the mob-action human behavior (that whole thing Isaac Azimov wrote on and created Psychohistory from).

<br>
Reminds me when I pondered the idea of having children.  I'd never want a child like myself, nor like my sister.  My sister is an oppositional defiant drama queen, pretty much as far down the "bad apple" road as you can go without adding drugs or vandalism.  I wasn't exactly a "good apple" either, but damn, my parents thought I was, I had so many passive ways of getting around them that it appeared like I did what they asked.  I'd never want a kid like me because I'd be afraid of what they were doing.</p></td>

but when u have a kid, everything changes, your biology helps allay your fears
<br>
<br>
if we didnt have that, we wouldnt be here, we would have been eliminated by evolution long ago
<br>
<br>
its interesting how our reproductive drives are affected by a crowded planet
<br>
<br>
people say its technology, but i think overpopulation is just as much responsible
<br>
<br>
i have done extensive geneaologies on my own family, some going back 1000 yrs. 
<br>
<br>
i have one ggggma, i call her 'super granny'
<br>
<br>
lived in the hills of the ozarks, 150 yrs ago
<br>
<br>
had 8 kids w one man, had an affair, got married again, 10 more kids
<br>
<br>
u know anyone like that today?
<br>
<br>
i do know one engineer, a devout christian, that has 10 kids, but that is exceedingly rare</p></td>
