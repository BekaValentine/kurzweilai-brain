<div class="TeaserText">"Something radically new is in the air: new ways of understanding physical systems, new ways of thinking about thinking that call into question many of our basic assumptions. A realistic biology of the mind, advances in physics, electricity, genetics, neurobiology, engineering, the chemistry of materials&#8212;all are challenging basic assumptions of who and what we are, of what it means to be human. The arts and the sciences are again joining together as one culture, the third culture. Those involved in this effort&#8212;scientists, science-based humanities scholars, writers&#8212;are at the center of today's intellectual action. They are the new humanists."</div>

<br><i>Originally published on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011074627/http://www.edge.org/" target="_blank">Edge.org</a> 
            April 24, 2002. Published on KurzweilAI.net, May 14, 2002. </i>
<p>In 1992, in an essay entitled "The Emerging Third Culture," 
              I put forward the following argument:<br>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In the past few years, the playing field of American 
                intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has shifted, and the traditional intellectual 
                has become increasingly marginalized. A 1950s <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> in Freud, 
                Marx, and modernism is not a sufficient qualification for a <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
                person today. Indeed, the traditional American intellectuals are, 
                in a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, increasingly reactionary, and quite often proudly 
                (and perversely) ignorant of many of the truly significant intellectual 
                accomplishments of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Their culture, which dismisses <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, 
                is often nonempirical. It uses its own jargon and washes its own 
                laundry. It is chiefly characterized by comment on comments, the 
                swelling spiral of commentary eventually reaching the point where 
                the real world gets lost.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>
              Ten years later, that fossil culture is in decline, replaced by 
              the emergent "third culture" of the essay's title, a reference 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. P. Snow's celebrated division of the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> world into two 
              cultures-that of the literary intellectual and that of the scientist. 
              This new culture consists of those scientists and other thinkers 
              in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, 
              have taken the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering 
              visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what 
              we are. </p>
<p><b>A Great Intellectual Hunger</b></p>
<p>Advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> are being debated and propagated by the scientists 
              of the third culture, who share their work and ideas not just with 
              each other but with a newly educated public through their books. 
              Staying with the basics, focusing on the real world, they have led 
              us into one of the most dazzling periods of intellectual activity 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, one in which their achievements are affecting 
              the lives of everyone on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. The emergence of this activity 
              is evidence of a great intellectual hunger, a desire for the new 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant ideas that drive our times. Educated people are willing 
              to make the effort to learn about these new ideas. Book review editors, 
              television news executives, professionals, university administrators 
              are discovering the empirical world on their own. They are reading 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> about revolutionary developments in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>,

              teraflop <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Among others.</p>
<p><b>One Intellectual Whole</b></p>
<p>Around the fifteenth century, the word "humanism" was 
              tied in with the idea of one intellectual whole. A Florentine nobleman 
              knew that to read Dante but ignore <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> was ridiculous. Leonardo 
              was a great artist, a great scientist, a great technologist. Michelangelo 
              was an even greater artist and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er. These men were intellectually 
              holistic giants. To them the idea of embracing humanism while remaining 
              ignorant of the latest scientific and technological achievements 
              would have been incomprehensible. The <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> has come to reestablish 
              that holistic definition.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, a period of great scientific advancement, 
              instead of having <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> at the center of the intellectual 
              world-of having a unity in which scholarship includes <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> just as it includes literature and <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>-the official culture 
              kicked them out. The traditional humanities scholar looked at <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> as some sort of technical special product-the fine 
              print. The elite universities nudged <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> out of the liberal 
              arts undergraduate curriculum, and out of the minds of many young 
              people, who abandoned true humanistic inquiry in their early twenties 
              and turned themselves into the authoritarian voice of the establishment. 
            </p>
<p>Thus, as we enter the most exciting and turbulent intellectual 
              times in the past five hundred years, the traditional humanities 
              academicians-by dismissing and ignoring <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              it-have so marginalized themselves that they are no longer within 
              shouting distance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. One can only marvel at, for example, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> critics who know nothing about visual <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>; "social 
              constructionist" literary critics uninterested in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              universals documented by anthropologists; opponents of genetically 
              modified foods, additives, and pesticide residues who are ignorant 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and too lazy to look up the statistics on 
              risk. </p>
<p>And one is amazed that for others still mired in the old establishment 
              culture, intellectual debate continues to center on such <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s 
              as who was or was not a Stalinist in 1937, or what the sleeping 
              arrangements were for guests at a Bloomsbury weekend in the early 
              part of the twentieth century. This is not to suggest that studying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is a waste of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> illuminates our origins and 
              keeps us from reinventing the wheel. But the question arises: <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              of what? Do we want the center of culture to be based on a closed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, a process of text in/text out, and no empirical contact 
              with the world in between?</p>
<p>A fundamental distinction exists between the literature of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              and those disciplines in which the writing is most often concerned 
              with exegesis of some earlier writer. In too many university courses, 
              most of the examination questions are about what one or another 
              earlier authority <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. The subjects are self-referential. Yes, 
              there is a <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, but it is a field in its own right, 
              quite separate from <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> itself. An examination in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of questions on the real stuff, as it were, rather than what 
              our predecessors <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Unlike those disciplines in which there 
              is no expectation of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and in which one reflects 
              on and recycles the ideas of earlier thinkers, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> moves on; 
              it is a wide-open <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Meanwhile, the traditional humanities 
              establishment continues its exhaustive insular hermeneutics, indulging 
              itself in cultural pessimism, clinging to its fashionably glum outlook 
              on world events. </p>
<p><b>Cultural Pessimism</b></p>
<p>"We live in an era in which pessimism has become the norm," 
              writes Arthur Herman, in The Idea of Decline in Western <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a>. 
              Herman, who coordinates the Western <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">Civilization</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> at the 
              Smithsonian, argues that the decline of the West, with its view 
              of our "sick <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>," has become the dominant theme in 
              intellectual discourse, to the point where the very idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> 
              has changed. He writes:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>This new <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> might take the shape of the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a>'s radical 
              environmental utopia. It might also be Nietzsche's Overman, or Hitler's 
              Aryan National Socialism, or Marcuse's <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">utopian</a> union of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              and Eros, or Frantz Fanon's revolutionary fellahin. Its carriers 
              might be the ecologist's "friends of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>," or the 
              multiculturalist's "persons of color," or the radical 
              feminist's New Amazons, or Robert Bly's New Men. The particular 
              shape of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> will vary according to taste; however, its 
              most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant virtue will be its totally non-, or even anti-Western 
              character. In the end, what <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s to the cultural pessimist is 
              less what is going to be created than what is going to be destroyed-namely, 
              our "sick" modern <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.....the sowing of despair and 
              self doubt has become so pervasive that we accept it as a normal 
              intellectual stance-even when it is directly contradicted by our 
              own <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Key to this cultural pessimism is a belief in the myth of the noble 
              savage-that before we had <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, people lived in 
              ecological <a class="thought" href="entries/harmony_entry.html">harmony</a> and bliss. Quite the opposite is the case. </p>
<p>In <i>Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern 
              World</i>, Oliver Bennett, the director of the Centre for Cultural 
              Policy Studies at the University of Warwick, pushes <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s a step 
              further when he writes that "the intellectual judgments on 
              which cultural pessimism rests are inflected by that same complex 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, psychological and sociological factors that are linked 
              to the incidence of some forms of depression and anxiety." 
              He wonders whether the intellectuals of the postmodern world would 
              benefit from antidepressants ("Schopenhauer on Prozac would 
              perhaps have produced a different philosophical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>"). </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>There seems to have always been an antagonism toward the scientific and humanist approach to reality from the time of Plato and his rejection of art. As I see it, we can cherish both without being totally immersed in either. The concept of relativity can give us reference points for important comparisons; We should be wary of taking perceptions as truth; religion can have many good truths; however, this does not make the whole of them true; the same can be true for science; at best they are paradigms, part of the whole; whatever that is. The bottom line is, we
<br>
must question everything. Ideals can be good things, but if not careful may lead to dogmatism and cults. It is true that art can give psychological depth, which can be exciting, can give us empathy to others, and most of all can give color to our lives; but, remember what Freud stated, that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>    You and I might not choose to "go back to nature," so to speak, but, if you had the skills, (and if there weren't six billion people on the Earth), it might not seem as farfetched, once you understand the true state of nature. 
<br>
     I am an anthropologist.  I have spent the better part of the last 20 years studying hunter-gatherers and "primitive" agriculturalists, both first hand, in South America, Africa and Asia and by combing through the primary literature.
<br>
     I don't think you would find many contemporary anthropologists who have actually done fieldwork who would disagree with the following:
<br>
<br>
     A.  Contrary to popular perception, hunter-gatherers generally have more leisure time, spend less time working, and eat a better, and healthier diet, than do most people living in our technological society;    
<br>
     B.  Famine is several orders of magnitude more likely in agriculturally based societies than among hunter-gatherer groups, even those who live in marginal lands such as the Kalahari;  
<br>
     C.  In terms of health, "primitive" people tend to suffer from far greater rates of infant mortality than we do; however, once a member of what I'll call a "primary" culture reaches adulthood, life expectancy is not too different from modern people--and in fact, is higher than it was for most people in civilized Europe until the 20th Century.  These people are usually stronger, usually have keener senses, and suffer from fewer chronic diseases than the typical US resident.
<br>
<br>
     From a purely subjective viewpoint, the people I have come to know over the years in my fieldwork also tend to seem more stable psychologically, happier, and less prone to pathological behavior than many of the people I have known back home.  That's not a very scientific observation, I guess, but it is not an uncommon observation.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>     No, I would not agree.  All human beings were hunter-gatherers for the overwhelming majority of the species' time on this planet.  By any reasonable standard, a human culture that endures for tens of thousands of years should be considered a successful adaptation.  
<br>
<br>
     As for the disappearance of most (not all) of these societies--Hunter-gatherers are displaced by agriculturalists because of population pressure.  It is an inexorable law in wildlife biology that populations grow to meet the available food supply.  Since agriculturalists store food, they tend to displace smaller groups by taking their land base as their population increases.
<br>
<br>
    As for inefficiency--it depends on how you define efficiency.  By some standards, hunter-gatherers are far more efficient than our society.  It takes far fewer calories for them to subsist than it does us, for example, if you include inputs from fossil fuels and other modern energy sources.
