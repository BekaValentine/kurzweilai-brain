<div class="TeaserText">At a launch event for the book on November 27, 2001, five of them discussed their influences, dreams, and where <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> innovation should focus with the book's author, David E. Brown, and Christopher Lydon, former host of National Public Radio's call-in talk show "The Connection." </div>

<br>
<p>Originally published November 28, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>
<i>Inventing Modern America: From the Microwave to the </i><i>Mouse</i> (MIT Press, 2002) profiles 35 inventors who helped to shape the modern world.</p>
<p>Lydon posed the question: "Who is the <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> of inventors? Who has 'Joe Dimaggio' standing in the world of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>?"</p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/wozniak_entry.html">Steve Wozniak</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> II <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> and co-founder of <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>, Inc., the answer ranged from Bob Dylan to his father, an engineer, to the Tom Swift Jr. books, which inspired him to get a ham radio license while he was still in the fifth grade. </p>
<p>What was perhaps most inspiring about those books? That they reflect "the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>'s life of not really having a job," he said. The rewards of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> for him are intrinsic ("in the brain") not extrinsic as in financial rewards. Indeed, for Wozniak, the marketplace "does not always reinforce creative solutions"--it tends to encourage monopolization by protection of market share, among other things.</p>
<p>The names <a class="thought" href="entries/edison_entry.html">Thomas Edison</a>, Benjamin Franklin, <a class="thought" href="entries/galileo_entry.html">Galileo</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> were evoked. <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">Inventor</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> said Edison's influence reigns as a "student of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends," something that <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> also says of himself in his role as <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> and anticipator of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> shifts in computing and other fields. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> also cited MIT's <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> as an early influence and mentor. </p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/langer_entry.html">Robert Langer</a>, biomedical engineer and pioneer of drug delivery systems, and nanotechnologist <a class="thought" href="entries/hubert_entry.html">Brian Hubert</a> cited less common influences--Dr. Judah Volkman, a Harvard <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> researcher, and architect Frank Lloyd Wright, respectively.</p>
<p>When asked what separates the engineer or scientist from the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, the ability to dream was a common theme. Referring to himself as "the dreamer," mouse <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/visionary_entry.html">visionary</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/englebart_entry.html">Doug Englebart</a> reflected on a moment years ago while he was at ARPA (the predecessor to <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a>), where he was called "just a dreamer." The speaker didn't realize, in Englebart's eyes, that dreaming (and thus inventing) is "serious hard work." For <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, it is precisely the journey from dream to positively impacting the lives of others, the "leap from the blackboard," that not only brings inspiration but also distinguishes the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>.</p>
<p>The ability to deal with failure looms large with these inventors. For Langer, the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to persist through failure is what separates the scientist from the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>. For <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, failure doesn't exist--it is "success deferred." </p>
<p>The ability to move from one <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> to another deftly, without specializing in one specific area, is a strength, although not always seen as such, that is another hallmark of inventors. "Inventors have a broad range of interests," noted Hubert, and the seeming naivete that inventors may bring to areas in which they are not experts is precisely what allows them to see beyond constraints. Wozniak shares this perspective. For him, the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> "still has the child in him."</p>
<p>Mixed views about the rewards of inventing were heard from the panelists and audience alike, since the other edge of reward can be seen as responsibility for the innovations that shape the world. As <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> put it, they could lead to either "promise or peril," depending upon who wields the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. </p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, money for an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> is like "clay to a sculptor": the most necessary resource for rendering dreams into actuality. However, Englebart questioned the notion that the only climate in which <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> can thrive is a market-driven <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that ultimately rewards inventors when their ideas result in <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> viability. Englebart envisions "social inventions" that address and prioritize burning issues, such as new threats from innovation and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. "Can't we adapt political institutions...before the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> arrives?" he asked.</p>
<p>And what do these inventors dream about? Hubert sees a world in which all objects gain <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> through embedded micro (and nano) technologies, where you can go shopping without checking out groceries because they have already been charged to your bank account by the time you walk out the door. But these embedded technologies may come with a price: if nanodevices attached to living cells in your body wirelessly transmit genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> quickly and easily, the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> may be available not only to you and your doctor but to insurance companies as well. </p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, the pervasive decentralization of the technological infrastructure seen in <a class="thought" href="entries/peer_to_peer_entry.html">peer to peer</a> applications over a vastly expanding <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--as well as the shrinking of fuel cell <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and the increasing use of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> in the area of business--will allow humans greater and greater <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> from physical constraints and physical threats (such as skyscrapers, as recent events have shown). But ethical issues that these new technologies raise--<a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>, to name one--are very serious. In <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s words, "the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is too important to leave to the technologists."</p>
<p>An anecdote by Wozniak also focused on this point. He illustrated how the innovation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> was partly due to not-so-technical novices who user-tested the early prototypes to insure a more "human" <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. Both Englebart and Wozniak dream of increasingly more human interfaces with <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> as well as more humane <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> serves human needs--not the other way around.</p>
<p>But why invent? What greater goal does innovation serve? Beyond practical necessity, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> extolled the artistic value of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>--"Beethoven didn't need to invent the 5th Symphony." <a class="thought" href="entries/wozniak_entry.html">Steve Wozniak</a> asked the question differently: "Isn't the purpose ... just to make people smile more and frown less?"</p>
<p>
<i>Inventing Modern America</i> profiles 35 inventors who exemplify the rich technological <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> of the United States over the past century. They have helped transform our homes, our healthcare, our work, our environment, and the way we travel and communicate.</p>
<p>The inventors profiled include such well-known figures as George Washington Carver, Henry Ford, and <a class="thought" href="entries/wozniak_entry.html">Steve Wozniak</a>, as well as unsung technological pioneers such as Stephanie Kwolek, <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of Kevlar, and Wilson Greatbatch, <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of the first implantable cardiac pacemaker.</p>
<p>The well-illustrated book should create excitement about <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> through the personal stories of these American scientists, technologists, and researchers. It is accessible enough to engage high school students yet wide-ranging and interesting enough to appeal to anyone who has ever wondered where microwave ovens and traffic lights come from.</p>
<p>The book was developed by the Lemelson-MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">Invention</a> and Innovation, whose mission is to inspire a new generation of American scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.</p>
