<div class="TeaserText">Members of the Global Task Force of The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology (CRN) have written 11 new essays addressing the  implications of molecular manufacturing. KurzweilAI.net will be posting all 11, starting today with essays by Nick Bostrom (Nanoethics and Technological Revolutions) and Robert A. Freitas, Jr. (What Price Freedom?). </div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="Section1"> Last month, eleven original essays about the 
              implications of <span style="color:black">molecular manufacturing&#8212;an 
              advanced form of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.crnano.org/whatis.htm" target="_blank">nanotechnology</a>&#8212;</span>were 
              posted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0654.html" target="_top">KurzweilAI.net</a>. 
              Written by members of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.crnano.org/CTF.htm" target="_blank">Global 
              Task Force</a> on Implications and Policy, some of the essays offered 
              promising opportunities, while others raised troubling concerns. 
              <p>Now we have eleven new essays that delve into additional 
                possibilities and impacts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, again authored by 
                members of CRN&#8217;s Global Task Force. All twenty-two articles were 
                edited by Mike Treder and Chris Phoenix, co-founders of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nonprofit_entry.html">nonprofit</a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.crnano.org/about_us.htm" target="_blank">Center for Responsible Nanotechnology</a> (CRN).</p>
<p>The mandate of the CRN Task Force is to thoroughly investigate 
                the societal and environmental implications of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>; 
                to separate real from fictional; and to develop comprehensive, 
                responsible, and workable recommendations. We began this focused 
                effort in August 2005 with a few core people, including <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> 
                (CEO of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_technologies_entry.html">Kurzweil Technologies</a>), Jerry Glenn (Director of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.acunu.org/" target="_blank">AC/UNU 
                Millennium Project</a>), David Brin (author of <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.davidbrin.com/tschp1.html" target="_blank">The Transparent <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a></a></i>), 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/bostrom_entry.html">Nick Bostrom</a> (Director, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Future 
                of Humanity Institute</a>, Oxford University), and Robert A. Freitas 
                Jr. (author of <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank"><a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a></a></i>). </p>
<p>Since then, our Task Force has grown to more than 65 
                people on five continents. We are continuing to add others with 
                diverse backgrounds and points of view. Additional experts in 
                geopolitics, <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>, and international policy 
                formation will be recruited. Without mutual understanding and 
                cooperation on a global level, the hazardous potentials of advanced 
                nanotechnology could spiral out of control and deny any hope of 
                realizing the benefits to society.</p>
<p>Of course, reaching conclusions will not be a quick process. 
                The early work of the CRN Task Force has underscored our realization 
                that there are <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.crnano.org/solutions.htm" target="_blank">no 
                simple answers or simple solutions</a>. Our plan from the beginning 
                has been to concentrate first on defining the challenge: What 
                risks do we really face? How do they relate to each other? What 
                is most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to know in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to design wise and effective 
                policies for molecular manufacturing?</p>
<p>The essays you are about to read approach these questions 
                from a variety of different directions. </p>
<p>In our opening piece, Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom sets the 
                stage with an overview of previous transformative technologies 
                and their ethical challenges in <b>&#8220;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0666.html%20" target="_top">Nanoethics

<p>If personal nanofactories supplant a large fraction of traditional 
                manufacturing, distribution, and retailing, then companies and 
                their employees could be impacted by the millions. In <b>&#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011075747/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0671.html" target="_top">The

                our remote past to our distant future, this collection of essays
