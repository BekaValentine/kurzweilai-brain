Previously, he was Chairman of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> department at Yale University and Director of the Yale <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Project. In addition, he was Assistant Professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/linguistics_entry.html">Linguistics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> at Stanford University. Schank holds a Ph.D in <a class="thought" href="entries/linguistics_entry.html">Linguistics</a> from the University of Texas at Austin. He is the founder of two businesses, Compu-Teach, an educational <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> company, and Cognitive Systems, a company specializing in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> processing. An internationally acclaimed researcher in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, Schank is the author of numerous articles and books, including <i>Dynamic </i><i>Memory</i><i>; Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding</i> with Robert Abelson; and <i>The Cognitive </i><i>Computer</i> and <i>The Creative Attitude</i> with Peter Childers. Christopher Owens is engaged in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> at the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Lab at Yale University, where he is currently completing a Ph.D. His primary interests are studying the organization of human <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and applying the principles thereof to the task of making machines smarter. His work focuses on people's ability to reuse old <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to solve new problems, specifically the kind of frozen, culturally shared <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> typified by the planning advice given in proverbs and other folk adages.</p>
<p>What exactly is <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>? Could a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> ever be creative? These are questions psychologists, philosophers, and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> researchers would all like to be able to answer. But what kind of answers are we looking for? The <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for a rigorous philosophical definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> has been overworked, and we don't intend to further pursue that course here. On the other hand, redefining the question in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> terms and applying <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> methods might result in a new and useful kind of answer, or at least an interesting set of new questions to consider.</p>
<p>A persistent criticism of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work has centered around arguments like, "By its very <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could never really be creative." Since a basic assumption underlying work in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is that a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can perform any task that can be described via sufficiently specific rules, people who make statements like the above mean that no rules can ever be found that will account for <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and other quintessentially human behavior, that there is something inherently mystical in these abilities that cannot be expressed via rules and procedures. Or else they might mean that even if such a set of rules and procedures could be found, a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that was obeying them would only seem to be creative. Its behavior, they say, would be a kind of elaborate parlor trick; it would be achieving its effect merely by fooling us.</p>
<p>But as <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> researchers and cognitive scientists, our work is based upon the assumption that rules and procedures underlying human behavior <i>can</i> be found. Our job is to define problems in such a way as to maximize our chances of succeeding in this endeavor. Our goal is to come up with an <i>algorithmic</i> definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, a set of processes and steps that can account for the kind of creative <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that we observe in people. Although the idea of a human or <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> exhibiting <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> by following a set of rules seems on the face to be a contradiction, this is not necessarily so. If we can agree on some kinds of behavior that constitute creative <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and can develop an algorithmic model that accounts for these behaviors, then we have an algorithmic theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and hence a first step toward creative machines. Whether or not a philosopher would agree that the resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> truly embodied <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> is almost irrelevant to us: building machines that act in ways that <i>appear</i> to be creative would be a significant enough step to undertake.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">Creativity</a> is often associated with problem solving, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, and the arts. People often view creative <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> as something out of the ordinary, as a mode of reasoning in which completed thoughts suddenly spring to mind without being cued, thoughts perhaps having nothing at all to do with what the thinker was working on at the time the <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> occurred. Often people implicitly assume that <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> represents some divine, unconscious, or other inspiration out of the control of one's ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes. Actual case studies of scientific and artistic <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, however, support the idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> springs not from any mystical source but from a certain set of cognitive skills. There is no principled distinction between creative and less creative <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> other than the degree to which this set of skills is applied. Highly creative individuals simply have these skills better developed than do the less creative. What, then, are these cognitive skills? How are they used? How can we <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to exhibit them? These are questions that we can study more fruitfully than the open-ended type of question, "What is <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">Creativity</a>?" with which this chapter opened.</p>
<p>In our view, the basic cognitive skill underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> is the ability <i>to intelligently</i> <i>misapply</i> things. A creative solution to a problem is one that uses an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, technique, or tool in a useful and previously undiscovered way. A creative work of art, similarly, might use some material or image in a new way. A creative piece of scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> might involve, for example, applying a principle from one field to a problem in another. At Yale we are studying the cognitive skills underlying one particular type of creative behavior, the creation of novel explanations for unexpected events. Explanation is a kind of problem solving in which the problem is of a mental <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>: "How can I connect this new and strange piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> with the rest of my <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> so that it all makes sense," or "What <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of events do I know about into which I can fit this new fact."</p>
<p>Of course, by this definition, many kinds of understanding can be seen as explanation, in that all understanding consists of integrating new facts into existing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. But what we are interested in here is the kind of explanation that requires conscious work, the explanation of events that are at first puzzling. This kind of explanation may require searching for a missing piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, or it may require finding some previously unseen causal connection. Often an explanation can be found by seeing one <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> or event as similar to another in a way that was not previously noticed, in other words, by making up and using a novel <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>. For example, when we asked people in the Yale <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> lab to try to explain the unexpected death of the successful three-year-old race horse Swale, one student was reminded of the death of Jim Fixx, the runner. He reasoned that Swale was like Fixx in that both participated in regular strenuous activity, and that possibly Swale, also like Fixx, had a congenital heart defect.</p>
<p>This kind of reasoning from prior examples is very important to our approach to explanation. Although an understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could conceivably explain each new situation by reasoning from first principles, chaining together all the rules and pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> it needed to build the entire explanation from small elements, this probably does not happen very often. One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> is that the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of this task is unreasonably large. Another is that people seem to be able to use remindings and analogical reasoning to construct explanations: they can use the same explanation over and over to cover a range of similar and thematically related situations.</p>
<p>For a second example of this kind of reasoning, consider the folk use of proverbs, which can be viewed as a kind of extremely abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> used by people to explain unfamiliar situations in a familiar way. When someone standing in the rain beside his disabled car and wishing he had had that overdue tune-up analyzes the situation by saying "A stitch in time saves nine," he has placed the situation in a <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> in which <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about topics like prevention and the bad effects of not taking precautions is available. The causal reasoning represented within this proverb is available without the effort of building an analysis or explanation from scratch.</p>
<p>In a manner similar to the way people might use proverbs, our systems store and reuse old explanations using a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> called an Explanation <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">Pattern</a>, or XP. Like a proverb, an XP is a frozen piece of causal reasoning. Because it is designed to be retrieved, modified, and applied by a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, it has the following basic components:</p>
<p>A characterization of a set of situations to which it is likely to apply, for example, deaths of athletes</p>
<p>A characterization of a broader set of situations to which, even if it does not apply, it is likely to be at least relevant, for example, unexpected bad outcomes</p>
<p>A causally annotated description of the event being explained. For example: Running involves physical exertion. Physical exertion strains the heart. Straining the heart combined with a heart defect can cause a heart attack. A heart attack can cause death.</p>
<p>Since we are viewing explanation as a kind of problem solving, and since a creative solution to a problem is one that uses an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, technique, or tool in a useful and previously undiscovered way, a creative explanation is one that uses an XP in a novel and previously unencountered way. If the basic idea of an explanation <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is to select a relevant XP from <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and apply it to a new episode, then the basic idea of a creative explanation <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is to intelligently misapply XPs; to try, if no relevant XP can be found, to modify and apply an XP that, although at first seemingly irrelevant, might nevertheless bear some thematic relationship to the episode being explained.</p>
<p>The idea of using near misses is an important one. Often people associate <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> with a simple relaxation of constraints on retrieval and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> matching, with some kind of random process by which weird remindings can be generated. <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">Creativity</a>, according to this view, consists of being tolerant of inappropriate remindings, in being slow to discard an erroneous idea. But that tolerance is only half the process. Because processing power is finite, the key is to be intelligent about choosing <i>which</i> inappropriate XP to misapply. <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">Creativity</a> does not lie in floundering through <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, trying one randomly selected idea after the next; it lies in finding near misses that are reasonably close to the right idea and fixing them to fit.</p>
<p>This approach puts a large demand on <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, since the retrieval task is no longer simply to find the closest fit from among a library of XPs (which selection, by the way, is an important task itself, and we do not mean to denigrate its difficulty here). The task of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is now to fail gracefully: to find the closest fit, or if a close fit is not available, to find a near miss that nevertheless captures some important and relevant aspects of the situation being explained. This kind of near miss is the most likely candidate for modification.</p>
<p>Along with a means for getting reasonable near misses, this approach also requires that the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, when presented with an inappropriate XP, be able to analyze what is wrong with it and to select an appropriate repair strategy based upon that analysis. The student who explained Swale's death in terms of Jim Fixx's knew that Jim Fixx was not a race horse, that the explanation would not directly apply without making the connection between a runner and a race horse. People do this so easily that we hardly think about it, yet the task is difficult. This modification of inappropriate XPs in order to adapt them to new situations, which we have been calling "tweaking," is central to being a creative explainer.</p>
<p>Our <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> must therefore embody three processes: a means of searching through <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> for applicable patterns that returns a reasonable set of near misses, a means of evaluating the near misses and seeing what is wrong with them, and a means of modifying those inappropriate patterns to suit the current situation. Of course, for any of this to work reasonably well, our creative <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> must have a rich <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of facts, experiences, and relationships it can draw upon as starting points for new explanations. Searching for and adapting patterns is a reasonable strategy only if the library of patterns is large enough that the near misses will nevertheless have at least something in common with the episode being explained. Our fourth requirement, therefore, is to have a large and richly indexed <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of explanation patterns and other <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> gained from <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. How these patterns are learned is another interesting problem to be attacked.</p>
<p>So we have transformed the questions "What is <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>?" and "Can a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> ever be creative?" into "What cognitive skills underlie creative behavior?" and "How can we <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> these skills into a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>?" Further refining the questions, we have discussed <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, which at first seems mystical and quintessentially human, in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures, <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>, retrieval, and adaptation, which seem quintessentially mechanistic. Creative explanation, we claim, is not so mysterious. It depends upon having a stock set of explanations, some heuristics for finding them at the right time, and some rules for tweaking them after they have been found. These problems are, of course, not as simple as this quick description might imply; each of them represents an important <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> area that is yet to be properly explored. Although trying to reduce <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> to mechanical processes might seem to be a kind of cheapening or demystification of human capabilities, that is not the case. The <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is that there must necessarily be mechanically understandable processes underlying intelligent behavior, and that our general purpose should be to deepen our understanding of human capabilities by defining and studying these mechanisms.</p>
