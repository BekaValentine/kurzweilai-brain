<div class="TeaserText">Abstract of talk to be delivered at the "Toward a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a>" Conference, April 10, 2002. Sponsored by the Center for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> Studies at the University of Arizona.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Who am I? What am I? Perhaps I am this stuff here, i.e., the ordered and chaotic collection of molecules that comprise my body and brain.</p>
<p>But there's a problem. The specific set of particles that comprise my body and brain are completely different from the atoms and molecules than comprised me only a short while (on the order of weeks) ago. We know that most of our cells are turned over in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of weeks. Even those that persist longer (e.g., neurons) nonetheless change their <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> molecules in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of weeks.</p>
<p>So I am a completely different set of stuff than I was a month ago. All that persists is the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of organization of that stuff. The <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> changes also, but slowly and in a continuum from my past self. From this perspective I am rather like the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that water makes in a stream as it rushes past the rocks in its path. The actual molecules (of water) change every millisecond, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> persists for hours or even years.</p>
<p>
<i>So, perhaps we should say I am a </i><i>pattern</i><i> of </i><i>matter</i><i> and </i><i>energy</i><i> that persists in time.</i>
</p>
<p>But there is a problem here as well. We will ultimately be able to scan and copy this <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> in a at least sufficient detail to replicate my body and brain to a sufficiently high degree of accuracy such that the copy is indistinguishable from the original (i.e., the copy could pass a "Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>" <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>). <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> brain <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> through neuromorphic modeling of both brain regions and <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> neurons is further along than most people realize. I will discuss the underlying exponential trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, communications, <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, brain modeling, and other relevant fields to address the question of when we will encounter a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that can convincingly pass for a human, as well as the more difficult task of recreating the personality and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of a specific person. I describe these scenarios in my essay "The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>" (see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613233846/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html" target="_new">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html</a>).</p>
<p>The copy, therefore, will share my <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. One might counter that we may not get every detail correct. But if that is true, then such an attempt would not constitute a proper copy. As time goes on, our ability to create a neural and body copy will increase in resolution and accuracy at the same exponential pace that pertains to all <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies. We ultimately will be able to capture and recreate my <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> neural and physical details to any desired degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>Although the copy shares my <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>, it would be hard to say that the copy is me because I would (or could) still be here. You could even scan and copy me while I was sleeping. If you come to me in the morning and say, "Good news, Ray, we've successfully reinstantiated you into a more durable <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>, so we won't be needing your old body and brain anymore," I may beg to differ.</p>
<p>If you do the <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, it's clear that the copy may look and act just like me, but it's nonetheless not me because I may not even know that he was created. Although he would have all my memories and recall having been me, from the point in time of his creation, Ray 2 would have his own unique experiences and his <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> would begin to diverge from mine.</p>
<p>Now let's pursue this train of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> a bit further and you will see where the dilemma comes in. If we copy me, and then destroy the original, then that's the end of me because as we concluded above the copy is not me. Since the copy will do a convincing job of impersonating me, no one may know the difference, but it's nonetheless the end of me. However, this scenario is entirely equivalent to one in which I am replaced gradually. In the case of gradual replacement, there is no simultaneous old me and new me, but at the end of the gradual replacement process, you have the equivalent of the new me, and no old me. So gradual replacement also means the end of me.</p>
<p>However, as I pointed out at the beginning of this question, it is indeed the case that I am being continually replaced. And, by the way, it's not so gradual, but a rather rapid process. As we concluded, all that persists is my <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> above shows that gradual replacement means the end of me even if my <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> is preserved. So am I constantly being replaced by someone else who just seems a like lot me a few moments earlier?</p>
<p>So, again, who am I? It's the ultimate ontological question. We often refer to this question as the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. I have consciously (no pun intended) phrased the issue entirely in the first person because that is the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the issue. It is not a third person question. So my question is not "Who is David Chalmers?" or "Who is <a class="thought" href="entries/hameroff_entry.html">Stuart Hameroff</a>?" although David and Stuart may ask this question themselves.</p>
<p>When people speak of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, they often slip into issues of behavioral and neurological correlates of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> (e.g., whether or not an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> can be self-reflective), but these are third person (i.e., objective) issues, and do not represent what David Chalmers calls the "hard question" of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>The question of whether or not an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is conscious is only apparent to himself. The difference between neurological correlates of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> (e.g., intelligent behavior) and the ontological <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is the difference between objective (i.e., third person) and subjective (i.e., first person) <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. For this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, we are unable to propose an objective <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> detector that does not have philosophical assumptions built into it.</p>
<p>I do say that we (humans) will come to accept that <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities are conscious because ultimately they will have all the subtle cues that humans currently possess that we associate with emotional and other subjective experiences. But that's a political and psychological prediction, not an observation that we will be able to scientifically verify (not without making some philosophical assumptions, albeit subtle ones). We do assume that other humans are conscious, but this is an assumption, and not something we can objectively demonstrate.</p>
<p>I will acknowledge that David Chalmers and <a class="thought" href="entries/hameroff_entry.html">Stuart Hameroff</a> do seem conscious, but I should not be too quick to accept this impression. Perhaps I am really living in a simulation, and they are part of the simulation. Or, perhaps it's only my memories of my interactions with them that exist, and the actual experiences never took place. Or maybe I am only now experiencing the sensation of recalling apparent memories, but neither the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> nor the memories really exist. Well, you see the problem.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>If we create an intelligent machine, and give it the ability to se, hear and even feel the touch of a hand on it's surface. Will these things not instigate a form of consciousness in the machine. Since our consciousness, the way I see it, is due to our ability to perceive ourselves and the world around us. I feel conscious, simply because I feel. But how to prove that I am acting out of consciousness and not out of programming, I do not know. Mainly because many of my actions is due to genetic programming. Anyway I am looking forward to having this new entity amongst us.

It is in a good accordance with an old idea of gaining the consciousness only several thousand years ago.

When you have the concept of self ... it may be not enough. The consciousness arises with the advancing it further. The information came in, with the spoken language, might be essential.

The rest of you are complex simulations designed to make my own existence appear worthwhile.                                          Consciousness, like so many other things in life, has no black and white division. There is no consciousness or non-consciousness, simply shades inbetween one extreme and the other. A quark is not all that conscious, and neither is a virus. Bugs are kinda dumb, but so are severely mentally retarded people. Words like 'consciousness' and 'life' and 'intelligence' carry meaning only when used in general terms. In other words, one cannot define something as conscious if it fits x criteria. Deciding whether or not someone or something is conscious is a matter of FAITH. As an atheist, I refuse to fall into cognitive paths dictated by religion, spirituality and the like.

<br>
That's alright to believe that way; However, be aware that it is still based on a certain kind of faith principle. To say that things appear worthwhile could be giving us too much credit; then again you could be referring to the stimulation, or simulation that your environment affords.  There is actually a theory that says that I or you are the only person or entity that exists.  I find that once one fall in this existential catagory, then it follows that much around us will not make sense, much like a Camus, or Kafka novel.  But, alas even anything we believe in is subject to opinion.   </p></td>
