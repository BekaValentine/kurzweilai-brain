<div class="TeaserText">Neurons alone aren't sufficiently complex to explain consciousness and provide a computational model for thought, according to Stuart Hameroff. He wants to go smaller, into a universe of structures within neurons where quantum mechanics help formulate a physical theory of consciousness.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published May 14, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p><h1>Introduction: <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a>=mind=<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>?</h1><p>What is <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>? How are we different from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s? Why do we have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s, feelings and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s?</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> imaging technologies demonstrate anatomical location of activities which appear to correlate with <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, but which may not be directly responsible for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>We are left with the questions of what <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> actually is, and how it is produced.</p>
<p>Most scientific explanations portray <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as an "emergent property" of classical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-like activities in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s. The prevailing views among scientists in this camp are that 1) patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> activities correlate with mental states, 2) synchronous <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> oscillations in thalamus and <a class="thought" href="entries/cerebral_cortex_entry.html">cerebral cortex</a> temporally bind <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, and 3) <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> emerges as a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> property of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> among <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, somewhat like how <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> emerges from complex and highly organized movements of air <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s</p>
<p>However, these approaches appear to fall short in fully explaining certain enigmatic features of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>, or 'qualia'- our 'inner <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>' (Chalmers' "hard problem");</li>
<li>Binding of spatially distributed <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> activities into unitary objects in vision, and a coherent <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of self, or 'oneness';</li>
<li>Transition from pre-conscious processes to <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> itself;</li>
<li>Non-computability, or the notion that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> involves a factor which is neither random, nor <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic, and that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> cannot be simulated (Penrose, 1989, 1994, 1997);</li>
<li><a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">Free will</a>;</li>
<li>Subjective <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conventional emergence approaches (also known as functionalist, <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist, materialist, physicalist, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>alist approaches) argue that <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and their chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s are the fundamental units of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and that conscious experience emerges when a critical level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is reached in interactions among these fundamental units.</p>
<p>This <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> conventional idea is that the mind is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> functioning in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> = mind = <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>). However in fitting the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al view, such explanations omit neurophysiological details such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widespread apparent randomness at all levels of neural processes (is it really <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>, or underlying levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>?);</li>
<li>Glial cells (which account for some 80% of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>);</li>
<li>Dendritic-dendritic processing (e.g. Pribram, Eccles);</li>
<li>Electrotonic gap junctions which connect <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al interiors;</li>
<li>Cytoplasmic/cytoskeletal activities within <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s; and,</li>
<li>Living state (the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is alive!).</li>
</ul>
<p>A further difficulty for the convenional <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>=mind=<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> approach is the absence of testable hypotheses in emergence theory. No threshold or rationale is specified; rather, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> "just happens."</p>
<p>Finally, the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of individual <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s is not accounted for in such arguments. Treating <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s as indivisible units, <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es or <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> states is an insult to <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Cells are themselves highly complex and dynamical. For example, single <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protozoan_entry.html">protozoan</a> organisms are able to swim, find food, and learn through the use of their internal cytoskeleton. Are such protozoa more intelligent than <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s? <br>

</p><h1>Inside <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">Neuron</a>s -- Microtubules and the Cytoskeleton</h1><p>Activities within cells ranging from single-celled organisms to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are organized by a dynamic scaffolding called the cytoskeleton, whose major <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s are microtubules. Hollow, crystalline cylinders 25 nanometers in diameter, microtubules are comprised of hexagonal lattices of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, known as tubulin. Microtubules are essential to <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> shape, function, movement, and division. In <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s microtubules self-assemble to extend axons and dendrites and form synaptic connections, then help to maintain and regulate synaptic activity responsible for <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and cognitive functions. Microtubules interact with membrane structures mechanically by linking <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, chemically by ions and "second-messenger" signals, and electrically by voltage fields.<br>

<p>While microtubules have traditionally been considered as purely structural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, recent evidence has revealed that mechanical signaling and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> functions also exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>MT "kinks" travel at 15 microns (2000 tubulin subunits) per second. Vernon and Woolley (1995) Experimental <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> 220(2)482-494</li>
<li>MTs vibrate (100-650 Hz) with nanometer displacement. Yagi, Kamimura, Kaniya (1994) <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> motility and the cytoskeleton 29:177-185</li>
<li>MTs optically "shimmer" when metabolically active. Hunt and Stebbings (1994), <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> motility and the cytoskeleton 17:69-78</li>
<li>Mechanical signals propogate through microtubules to <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>; mechanism for MT regulation of gene <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>. Maniotis, Chen and Ingber (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:849-854</li>
<li>Measured tubulin dipoles and MT conductivity suggest MTs are ferroelectric at physiological temperature (Tuszynski; Unger 1998)</li>
</ul>
<p>Current models propose that tubulins within microtubules undergo coherent excitation, <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing between two or more conformational states in nanoseconds. Dipole couplings among neighboring tubulins in the microtubule lattice form dynamical patterns, or "automata," which evolve, interact and lead to the emergence of new patterns. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> indicates that microtubule automata <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> could support classical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing, transmission and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> within <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s.<br>

<p>Microtubule automata <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing offers a potentially vast increase in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al capacity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Conventional approaches focus on synaptic <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing at the neural level which optimally yields about 10<sup>18</sup> operations per second in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains (~10<sup>11</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s/<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with ~10<sup>4</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s/<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing at ~10<sup>3</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>). Microtubule automata <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing can explain some 10<sup>27</sup> operations per second (~10<sup>11</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s with ~10<sup>7</sup> tubulins/<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing at ~10<sup>9</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>). Indeed, the fact that all <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> cells typically contain approximately 10<sup>7</sup> tubulins could account for the adaptive behaviors of single-celled organisms which have no nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s. Rather than simple <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are complex <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/panpsychism_entry.html">Panpsychism</a> Meets Quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">Gravity</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> at the Planck scale)</h1><p>But how does a further level of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing help explain <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>? Greater <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and ultra-<a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ism to the level of microtubule automata don't really explain enigmatic features of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, in particular the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of conscious experience; they merely facilitate emergence. Something more is required. If functional approaches and emergence are incomplete, perhaps the raw <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of mental processes (qualia) are fundamental properties of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> (like mass, spin or charge). This view has long been held by panpsychists throughout the ages--for example Buddhists and Eastern philosophers claim a "universal mind." Following the ancient Greeks, Spinoza argued in the 17th century that some form of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> existed in everything physical. The 19th century mathematician Leibniz proposed that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> was composed of an infinite number of fundamental units, or "monads," with each possessing a form of primitive psychological being. In the 20th century, Bertrand Russell claimed that there was a common <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> underlying both mental and physical processes, while John Wheeler and David Chalmers have maintained that there exists an experiential aspect to fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the work of the 20th century philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, whose pan-experiential view remains most consistent with modern <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. Whitehead argued that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is a process of events occurring in a wide, <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> field of proto-conscious experience. These events, or "occasions of experience," may be comparable to quantum state <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s, or actual events in physical reality (Shimony, 1993). This suggests that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> may involve quantum state <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s (e.g. a form of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>).</p>
<p>But what of Whitehead's <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> field of proto-conscious experience? In what medium are the "occasions of experience" (quantum state <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s) occurring? Could proto-conscious qualia simply exist in the empty <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>?</p>
<p>What is empty space? Historically, empty <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> has been described as either an absolute void or a pattern of fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>. Democritus and the Michaelson-Morley results argued for "nothingness" while <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> ("plenum") and Maxwell ("ether") rejected the notion of emptiness in favor of "something"--a background pattern. Einstein weighed in on both sides of this debate, initially supporting the concept of a void with his theory of special <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> but then reversing himself in his theory of general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> and its curved <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and geometric distortions-the <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> metric. Could proto-conscious qualia be properties of the metric, fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>?</p>
<p>What is fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>? We know that at extremely small scales, <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> is not smooth, but granular, or quantized. This occurs at the infinitesimal Planck scale (10<sup>-33</sup> cm, 10<sup>-43</sup> secs). The fundamental level of spacetime <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is described through quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>. A final theory of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> could unite quantum theory and general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, the great divide in modern <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>.<br>

<p>At the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> level, this granularity has been modeled by <a class="thought" href="entries/penrose_entry.html">Roger Penrose</a> as a dynamic web of quantum spins. These "spin <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s" create an array of geometric volumes and <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s at the Planck scale which dynamically evolve and define <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>. Other approaches to this problem include "<a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a> ," but regardless of which explanation best characterizes the fundamental level and the basis for quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, if panpsychist (or pan-protopsychist, or pan-experiential) philosophical approaches are correct, the fundamental level (Planck scale) the "funda-mental" level could provide the basis for qualia or proto-conscious experience. Further, if qualia are embedded at the Planck scale, then perhaps (as suggested by <a class="thought" href="entries/penrose_entry.html">Roger Penrose</a>) Platonic values like mathematical truth and aesthetic values are embedded there as well.</p><h1>The Quantum Connection</h1><p>If proto-conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and Platonic values are embedded at the Planck scale, how could they be linked to <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>? How could our brains <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, or be influenced by these infinitesimal features? A possible solution comes through <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, or quantum theory.</p>
<p>Quantum theory describes the bizarre behavior of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> at the scale of atoms and sub-atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s. A century of experimental observation of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s have shown that, at least at small scales, <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s (mass) can exist in two or more states or locations simultaneously (quantum superposition). But in our everyday world objects seem definite, and occupy single states and locations. The transition from quantum possibilities to definite, classical states is often called "collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function," or "quantum state <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>."</p>
<p>Experimental evidence in the early part of this century led great theorists Bohr, Heisenberg and Wigner to conclude (the "Copenhagen interpretation") that objects remain in <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a>-like quantum superposition until observed by a conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being--<a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> causes collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function! To illustrate the apparent absurdity of this conclusion, in the 1930's Schroedinger devised his famous <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> experiment: "<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Schroedinger\'s Cat')">Schroedinger's cat</a>." A living <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is placed in a box into which poison can be released by a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, e.g., sending a <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> through a half-silvered mirror. So there are equal possibilities that the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is either dead or alive. As a quantum phenomenon, the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> is in superposition, and so both passes through, and does not pass through, the half silvered mirror. But according to the Copenhagen interpretation, until a conscious being opens the box to observe, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is both dead <i>and</i> alive. Schroedinger's point was that the conscious observer interpretation was incorrect.</p>
<p>Other explanations have been developed. David Bohm's theory avoids collapse (but raises other problems), and the "multiple worlds" view holds that each possibility in a superposition evolves into a new and separate <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> describes environmental "decoherence," essentially saying that any interaction between a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and the outside world causes loss of the quantum superposition with random choice of particular classical states. However there is no explanation for the <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> of quantum superpositions which remain isolated from environment.</p>
<p>Many physicists now believe that intermediate between tiny quantum-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and "large" <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>-size <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s some objective factor disturbs the superposition to cause collapse, or "objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> (OR)." For example the GRW theory (after its proponents Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber) suggests that as a quantum superposition grows to a critical number of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s in superposition (~10<sup>17</sup>), the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> spontaneously reduces to classical states. Experimental evidence has not supported GRW. According to <a class="thought" href="entries/penrose_entry.html">Roger Penrose</a> the objective factor causing <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> is an intrinsic feature of <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> itself (quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>).</p>
<p>To begin, Penrose extends Einstein's theory of general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> (in which mass equates to curvature in <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a>) down to the Planck scale. Quantum superposition--actual separation (displacement) of mass from itself-- is equivalent to simultaneous spacetime curvatures in opposite directions, causing "bubbles," or separations in fundamental reality. (To illustrate, 4-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> is simplified as a 2 dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> sheet -- Figure 8). The Penrose view is similar to the multiple worlds view in that superposition involves a separation in underlying reality, however rather than evolving an entire new <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, Penrose <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that these bubble-like separations are unstable and reduce to specific states and locations after a critical degree of separation. Objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s are thus a self-organizing process at the fundamental level of reality. If proto-conscious experience is rooted in the Planck scale, then such self-organizing objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s are processes occurring in an experiential medium. <br>

<p>Superposition and subsequent <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>, or collapse, to single, classical states may have profoundly important applications in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></p>
<p>The critical threshold for Penrose quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> OR is defined by the indeterminacy principle:</p>
<p>E = h/T</p>
<p>where E is the gravitational self-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> of the superposed mass separated from itself (the magnitude of the superposition), h is Planck's constant divided by 2pi, and T is the coherence <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> until collapse occurs. Thus, the size and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in superposition, or the degree of <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> separation, is inversely related to the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> T until <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>. (E can be calculated from the superposed mass <i>m</i> and the separation distance <i>a</i>. See e.g. Hameroff and Penrose, 1996a.)</p>

<p> How can quantum state <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> by objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> and other quantum features help explain <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>?</p><h1>Quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a></h1><p>Superposition and subsequent <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>, or collapse, to single, classical states may have profoundly important applications in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, as well as toward the understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. In the 1980s Benioff, Feynmann, Deutsch and other physicists proposed that quantum states could interact (via entanglement) and enact <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> while in quantum superposition of all possible states ("<a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>").</p>
<p>Classical computing utilizes <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a> bits as either 1 or 0; quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s involve the processing of superpositioned "qubits" of both 1 and 0 (and other states) simultaneously.</p>
<p>Quantum theory also tells us that two or more <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, if once together, will remain somehow connected ("entangled"), even when separated by great distances. Qubits can interact by <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_entanglement_entry.html">quantum entanglement</a>, so that <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> is able to achieve a nearly infinite parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al ability. Quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, if they can be constructed, will be able to solve important problems (e.g. <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es, factoring large numbers) with efficiency unattainable in classical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (Shor, 1994).</p>

M is related to the number of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary operations performed per qubit before the superposition/<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is disrupted by decoherence (or in the case of microtubules in the Orch OR proposal, to be described below, before objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> terminates the superposition).<br>

<p>Results, or solutions in <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> are obtained when, after a period of quantum superposition/<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, the qubits "collapse," or reduce to classical <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> states ("collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function"). As quantum superposition may only occur in isolation from environment, collapse (<a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>) may be induced by breaching isolation (this is what is envisioned in technological quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s--making a measurement). But what about quantum superpositions which remain isolated, for example Schroedinger's mythical <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> which is both dead and alive? If the collapse occurs by Penrose OR, and if proto-conscious experience occurs at the fundamental level of reality, then such quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s could be conscious.</p>
<p>Could Penrose objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> occur in the brain? If so (from E = h/T) <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> T would be expected to coincide with known neurophysiological processes with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scales from tens to hundreds of milliseconds (e.g. 25 msec for coherent 40 Hz, 100 msec for alpha EEG, 500 msec for sensory threshold events such as Libet's famous 1979 experiments). In what types of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> structures might quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> with objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> occur? For T in this range we can calculate (from E = h/T, and with E related to mass <i>m</i> as described in Hameroff and Penrose, 1996a) that superpositioned mass <i>m</i> in the nanogram range would be required for conscious events of 40 to 500 msec. What <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s in nanogram quantitites could support quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>? What is <i>m</i>?</p><h1>Are <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a>s Qubits?</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is organized by <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. By changing their conformational shape, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s are able to perform a wide variety of functions, including muscle movement, molecular binding, enzyme catalysis, metabolism, and movement. Dynamical <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> structure results from a "delicate balance among powerful countervailing forces" (Voet &amp; Voet, 1995). The types of forces acting on <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s include charged interactions (such as covalent, ionic, electrostatic, and <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> bonds), hydrophobic interactions, and dipole interactions. The latter group, also known as van der Waals forces, encompasses three types of interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>permanent dipole - permanent dipole,</li>
<li>permanent dipole - induced dipole, and</li>
<li>induced dipole - induced dipole (London dispersion forces)</li>
</ul>
<p>As charged interactions cancel out, hydrophobic and dipole - dipole forces are left to regulate <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> structure. While induced dipole - induced dipole interactions, or London dispersion forces, are the weakest of the forces, they are also the most numerous and influential. Indeed, they may be critical to <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> function. For example, anesthetics are able to bind in hydrophobic "pockets" of certain neural <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s and ablate <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> by virtue of disrupting these London forces. London force attraction between any two atoms is usually less than a few kilojoules; however, since thousands occur in each <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, they add up to thousands of kilojoules per mole, and cause changes in conformational structure. As London forces are <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al in <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> folding (a problem intractable to conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al simulation), <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> conformation and folding may be quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s.<br>

</p><h1>Orch OR, Cognition and <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">Free Will</a></h1><p>Quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> with objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> (Orch OR) is potentially applicable to cognitive activities. While classical neural-level <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> can provide a partial explanation, the Orch OR model allows far greater <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> capacity, and addresses issues of conscious experience, binding, and non-computability consistent with <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>. Functions like face recognition and volitional choice may require a series of conscious events arriving at intermediate solutions. For the purpose of illustration consider single Orch OR events in these two types of cognitive activities.</p>
<p>Imagine you briefly see a familiar woman's face. Is she Amy, Betty, or Carol? Possibilities may superpose in a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. For example, during 25 milliseconds of pre-conscious processing, quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> occurs with <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (Amy, Betty, Carol) in the form of "qubits," superposed states of microtubule tubulin subunits within groups of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. All possibilities coexist. As threshold for objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> is reached, an instantaneous conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> occurs. The superposed tubulin qubits reduce to definite states, becoming bits, and one particular possibility is chosen. Now, you recognize that she is Carol! (an immense number of possibilities could be superposed in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s 10<sup>19</sup> tubulins).<br>

<span class="Caption"> Figure 20. Face recognition. A familiar face induces superposition (left) of three possible solutions (Amy, Betty, Carol) which "collapse" to the correct answer Carol (right). Volitional choice. Three possible dinner selections (shrimp, sushi, pasta) are considered in superposition (left), and collapse via Orch OR to choice of sushi (right).</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>In a volitional act possible choices may be superposed. Suppose for example you are selecting dinner from a menu. During pre-conscious processing, shrimp, sushi and pasta are superposed in a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. As threshold for objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> is reached, the quantum state reduces to a single classical state. A choice is made. You'll have sushi!</p>
<p>How does the choice actually occur? In a conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> scheme, the selection criteria can be described by a deterministic <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> which precludes the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>. The non-computable influence in Orch OR may be useful in understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>.</p>
<p>The problem in understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a> is that our <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s seem neither totally deterministic nor random (probabilistic). What else is there in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>? As previously described, in OR (and Orch OR) the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> outcomes are neither deterministic nor probabilistic, but involve a factor which is "non-computable." The microtubule quantum superposition evolves linearly (<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) but is influenced at the instant of collapse by hidden non-local variables (quantum-mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> inherent in fundamental spacetime <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>). The possible outcomes are limited, or probabilities <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> ("orchestrated"), by neurobiological feedback (in particular microtubule associated <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, or MAPs). The precise outcome3/4our <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s3/4are chosen by effects of the hidden <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> on the quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> poised at the edge of objective <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>.<br>

<span class="Caption"> Figure 21. <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">Free will</a> may be seen as the result of deterministic processes (behavior of trained <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> windsurfer) acted on repeatedly by non-computable influences, here represented as a seemingly capricious wind.</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>Consider a sailboard <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>. A sailor sets the sail in a certain way; the direction the board sails is determined by the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of the wind on the sail. Let's pretend the sailor is a non-conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> zombie run by a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> which is trained and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to sail. Setting and adjusting of the sail, sensing the wind and position, jibing and tacking (turning the board) are <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic and deterministic, and may be <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to the pre-conscious, <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> phase of Orch OR. The direction and intensity of the wind (seemingly capricious, or unpredictable) may be considered <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to Planck scale hidden non-local variables (e.g. "Platonic" quantum-mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> inherent in <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>). The choice, or outcome (the direction the boat sails, the point on shore it lands) depends on the deterministic sail settings acted on repeatedly by the apparently unpredictable wind. Our "<a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>" <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s could be the net result of deterministic processes acted on by hidden quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> at each Orch OR <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. This can explain why we generally do things in an orderly, deterministic fashion, but occasionally our <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s or <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s are surprising, even to ourselves.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> Feasibility--the Problem of Decoherence</h1><p>Orch OR and other quantum approaches can in principle explain enigmatic features of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. But how could delicate quantum superposition/<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> be isolated from environmental decoherence in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (generally considered to be a noisy thermal bath) while also communicating (input/output) with the environment? One possibility is that quantum superposition/<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> occurs in an isolation phase which alternates with a communicative phase, for example at 40 Hz. One of the most primitive <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> functions is the transition of cytoplasm between a liquid, solution ("sol") phase, and a solid, gelatinous ("gel") phase due to assembly and disassembly of the cytoskeletal <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> actin. Actin sol-gel transitions can occur at 40 Hz or faster, and are known to be involved in <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al synaptic release mechanisms.</p>
<p>Mechanisms for enabling microtubule quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and avoiding decoherence long enough to reach threshold may include (for details see Hagan et al, 2000):</p>
<ul>
<li>Sol-gel transitions;</li>
<li> Plasma phase sleeves (microtubules are surrounded by counterion zones (Sackett);</li>
<li>Hydrophobic pockets;</li>
<li>Hollow microtubule cores;</li>
<li><a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">Laser</a>-like pumping, including environment (Frohlich, Conrad).</li>
<li>Topological quantum error correcting codes</li>
</ul>
<p>Another apparent obstacle to the Orch OR proposal is how the weak <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> involved in the gravitational collapse can be influential. For a detailed description of this problem and potential solutions, see Hameroff, 1998c. One possibility is that the gravitational self-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is delivered to the involved tubulins via London forces virtually instantaneously (e.g. within one Planck <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) so that the power (<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) is significant--approximately one kilowatt per tubulin per Orch OR <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. <br>

Are all living organisms conscious, or did <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> emerge more recently, e.g. with <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> or toolmaking? Or did <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> appear somewhere in between, and if so, when and why? The Orch OR model (unlike other models of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>) is able to make a prediction as to the onset of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Based on E = h/T we can ask, for example, is it feasible for single <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> organisms such as <a class="thought" href="entries/paramecium_entry.html">paramecium</a> (which exhibit complex behavior such as graceful swimming, mating and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>) to be conscious? Single cells including <a class="thought" href="entries/paramecium_entry.html">paramecium</a> should contain approximately 10<sup>7</sup> tubulins, so T would be 50,000 msec, or nearly one minute. This seems unlikely. Larger organisms such as the nematode worm (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. elegans) with 300 <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (3 x 10<sup>9</sup> tubulins) would need to maintain quantum isolation for only 133 msec - not unreasonable. Such organisms (tiny worms and urchins) were prevalent at the beginning of the "<a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion," a burst of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> which occurred 540 million years ago.

<p>Would <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> be advantageous to survival (above and beyond intelligent, complex behavior)? It seems that, yes, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> would indeed be advantageous to survival, and hence capable of accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Non-computable behavior (unpredictability, intuitive <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s) would be beneficial in predator-prey relations. Having conscious experience of taste would promote finding food; the experience of pain would promote avoiding predators. And the pleasurable qualia of <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> would promote reproduction.</p>
<p>So "what is it like to be a worm?" Lacking our sensory apparatus, associative <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and complex nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> such primitive <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> would be a mere glimmer, a disjointed smudge of reality.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>i discovered your website yesterday, and am beginnng to explore.  congratulations on your great successes, in various endeavors.  
<br>
<br>
i am a devoted (published) author, and am becoming an (amateur) student of Orch OR.  hameroff's exposition is first-rate in most regards; i've surveyed much of the work on his web-site.  i also follow hawking and penrose, and for example, developments in string theory and quantum mechanics, so the merger of quan forces with biology has an intuitive (Orch OR?) appeal.
<br>
however, the devil, as they say, is in the details.  the one area i find lacking is a detailed exposition of the math involved with the formula essential to Orch OR, e=h/T.  for example, h, planck's constant is defined generally as being in the neighborhood of 10 -27th grams/cm/sec.  T is defined in milliseconds i.e. 10 -2 or 10 -3 sec. another important parameter seems to be operations per MT, approximately 10 8th.  also, i think there are about 10 7th tubulins/neuron.  the brain has 10 11th neurons so if 10% of the neurons are involved in an Orch OR event, we get about 10 10th involved neurons.     if we add the exponents we get, (8+7+10)= about 10 25th operations in the brain.  however, i am a teacher (and attorney, not practicing) and numbers are not my forte.  
<br>
<br>
a fuller calculation, demonstrating an interaction-connection with the planck constant, would be appreciated.  otherwise, neat article and web-site.  
<br>
<br>
regards,
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"Orch OR and other quantum approaches can in principle explain enigmatic features of consciousness. But how could delicate quantum superposition/computation be isolated from environmental decoherence in the brain (generally considered to be a noisy thermal bath) while also communicating (input/output) with the environment? One possibility is that quantum superposition/computation occurs in an isolation phase which alternates with a communicative phase, for example at 40 Hz. "  
<br>
Just a thought here.... If i'm not mistaken i've read that time is thought to be incremental, and not fluid, like a second hand ticking on a clock and not just moving fluidly around the clock, is it possible that delicate quantum superposition/computation occurs in these gaps in time effectively isolating them long enough for delicate quantum superposition/computation to occur? eh i'm no scientist...just a thought ;)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You know, there's  something  wrong  with  our  evolutionistic  science whi  is  generally  accepted as  TRUTH..
<br>
<br>
Band  most  of  the  hypohesis  about  emergence  of consciousness  on the  brain did  really  speculate  much.  :-)..  I  don't  like  the  paradigm..  that  little  subatomic  clever  particles  randomly combined  together  ina  superposition and  consciousneess  appeared.  is  that  eventual thing  that  they  are  trying  to show..
<br>
<br>
There  could  be  trillionth  of  other  hypothesis  and  point's  of  views..  until  we  would  have some  kinda  super  quanto microscopes  which  could  magnify  and  see  trillionth portion of  a  nano cantimeter.. or  milimeter..  nanomilimeter..  
<br>
As  Immanuel  Kant  has pointed out  that when it  comes to  certain points of  these  perennial  questions  and  when we  don't  have  SUBSTANCES  to  observe   EXACTLY  ..  our  minds  just  speculate starting  from that  point..  
<br>
<br>
that's  true  actually..  we gotta  wait  for  our  computational  capacity  to  grow  and  our   Quantoscopes to come  for  us  to  be  able  to  observe  what  really  is  going  down there  in subatomic  scales  ..
<br>
<br>
For  example  once  speculation from me..
<br>
<br>
The  reason why  consciousnnes  occurss  is  just  because there  are  trillionth  of  other  highly  developed and  highly  intellectual  creatures  or  civilizations  down in the subatomic  levels  that  are  using  us  and  our  brains  and  everything to  observe  the universe.. 
<br>
<br>
in other  words  those  quarks  and proteins  are  not  automatas, on the  contrary  we  and  our  brains  are  just  bigger  observing  and discovering  machines  for  them :-)  Really  funny  isn't  it?
<br>
Just like  this  any  of  you  could  speculate  their  own points  of  view..
<br>
<br>
so  I  think  it's  not  difficult to make  some  brainstorm over  this..
<br>
<br>
As  discoverers said    tons  of  conjecture but  very  little  evidence..  and  down under  subatomic  levels  and up  on astronomic  levels it's  quite  hard  to get  some  kinda  evidence to  be  able  to  prove  what  one  claims..
<br>
<br>
so  we  wait  our  computational  power  to  come  first..
<br>
