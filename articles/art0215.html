<div class="TeaserText">The neo-Luddites are out in force to block new technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. The extropians are organizing to defend progress.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published June 26, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>"How do we deal with the opposition to <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and biotech from bioconservatives and technophobes?"</p>
<p>That's a question the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">Action</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050827135500/http://www.progressaction.org/" target="_new">Coalition</a> ("Pro-Act"), a newly formed organization announced at <a class="thought" href="entries/extropy_entry.html">Extropy</a> Institute's recent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050827135500/http://www.extropy.org/ex5/index.htm" target="_new">EXTRO-5 Conference</a> in San Jose, hopes to answer.</p>
<p>Speaking at the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, artist and "cultural catalyst" Natasha Vita-More, Pro-Act Director, said the fledgling organization aims to build a coalition of groups that will take on a broad range of neo-<a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a> opposed to new technologies such as genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, ranging from <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> to Greenpeace, Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation for Economic Trends, the Green party, and the current protestors at the BIO2001 conference in San Diego.</p>
<p>As an example, she showed a series of slick ads placed in the New York Times by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050827135500/http://www.turnpoint.org/" target="_new">Turning Point Project</a>, focusing on the <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> crisis, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, economic globalization, industrial agriculture, and megatechnology, which were "full of hyperbole and miscalculations."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a> magazine writer and "journalistic critic" Ronald Bailey, author of an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050827135500/http://www.reason.com/0107/fe.rb.rage.html" target="_new">analysis of the birth</a> of neo-<a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a>, warned that these groups are pushing the "precautionary principle," which would require that "when an activity raises threats of harm to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken, even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically--in other words, regulate first and ask questions later."</p>
<p>He pointed to the current coalition of environmental activists and anti-abortion fundamentalists currently supporting the proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Cloning Prohibition Act (H.R. 1644) to ban reproductive cloning, which would in turn block stem-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and the promise of developing new treatments for illnesses.</p>
<p>"The blood of billions of people is on the hands of people who oppose these technologies--what if you're wrong?" asked Robert Bradbury (referring to missed opportunities to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-saving biotechnologies) during a Q&amp;A, drawing a round of applause. "Get yourselves into therapy," psychiatrist Dr. Jerry Lamler, medical director of Alcor <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">Life Extension</a> Foundation, advised these groups.</p>
<p>For "tracker of <a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a>" Houston attorney <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050827135500/http://gregburch.net/progress.html" target="_new">Greg Burch</a>, vice president of <a class="thought" href="entries/extropy_entry.html">Extropy</a> Institute, direct conflict with these advocacy groups is unavoidable. "On the religious or <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ualist front, in the end we cannot accommodate limits on our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s imposed in the name of supernaturalism, whether based on tradition, imagined revelation or a mish-mash of syncretistic, subjective symbols. On the political front, we do not seek to force our plans on anyone, but ultimately, our <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> values of individual <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> are fundamentally incompatible with the kinds of limitations desired by guardians of both culturally conservative and '<a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ive' tendencies, whether they espouse some limited 'liberal' ideology or are more explicitly collectivist. And we certainly cannot avoid clear conflict with arguments by cultural conservatives like Leon Kass, who oppose <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cloning and genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> based on an irrational 'moral disgust.'"</p>
<p>However, in an interview with KurzweilAI.net, Vita-More said Pro-Act doesn't want to "point a harsh finger but to work toward a higher level of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and open debate while encouraging the public to ask questions, find reliable sources, and think about all aspects of these issues. Those who are opposed to advanced technologies have concerns that need to be addressed, such as takeover by global corporations, genetically modified organisms and genetically <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered foods, environmental toxins, and the question of who is in control of our genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Many of these concerns are valid to a degree, but these groups base them more on ideologies and fundamental fears than on <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> goal we can agree on is extending and improving <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. How much, through what means, and by whom is the argument."</p>
<p>"Imagine it is the year 2030 and we are looking back on our accomplishments of the past three decades," she says on the Pro-Act Web site. "How should our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> be best remembered? How about: <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">Cancer</a> reduced to a minor health problem that is easily curable; Billions of people enjoying lives enhanced by connection to a rich global cultural <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> solving the environmental damage of past centuries; <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">Art</a> forms barely imaginable today enriching the lives of a population made more creative through new technologies and new ideas; or, the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of true <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> realized, adding a new richness to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> landscape never before known.</p>
<p>"If we take <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> now, we can have a major impact on how the world views efforts to prolong and improve <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, advance the world's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about positive technologies, improve the environment, promote <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> travel, and address fundamental issues in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, the environment and the quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> for the vast majority of humanity that still lives in hunger, fear and ignorance."</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/extropy_entry.html">Extropy</a> Institute "brings together the finest critical and creative minds to challenge conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> limits and to develop, critique, and implement new ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>," according to its mission statement.</p>

The Neo - Luddites are possibly the worst society of hypocritic
