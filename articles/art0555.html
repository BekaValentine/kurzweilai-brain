              March 31, 2003. Published on KurzweilAI.net April 8, 2003.</i></p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the father of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              fiction, Herbert George Wells, said in his writings on <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a>, 
              "If we want to have an educated citizenship in a modern technological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, we need to teach them three things: reading, writing, and 
              statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>." At the beginning of the 21st century, 
              how far have we gotten with this <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>? In our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, we teach 
              most citizens reading and writing from the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> they are children, 
              but not statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. John Alan Paulos has called this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> 
              innumeracy.</p>
<p>There are many stories documenting this problem. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, 
              there was the weather forecaster who announced on American TV that 
              if the probability that it will rain on Saturday is 50 percent and 
              the probability that it will rain on Sunday is 50 percent, the probability 
              that it will rain over the weekend is 100 percent. In another recent 
              case reported by New Scientist, an inspector in the Food and Drug 
              Administration visited a restaurant in Salt Lake City famous for 
              its quiches made from four fresh eggs. She told the owner that according 
              to FDA <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, every fourth egg has salmonella <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, so the 
              restaurant should only use three eggs in a quiche. We can laugh 
              about these examples because we easily understand the mistakes involved, 
              but there are more serious issues. When it comes to medical and 
              legal issues, we need exactly the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> that H. G. Wells 
              was asking for, and we haven't gotten it.</p>
<p>What interests me is the question of how humans learn to live with 
              uncertainty. Before the scientific revolution, <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a> was a 
              strong ideal. <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">Religion</a> brought about a denial of uncertainty, and 
              many people knew that their kin or their race was exactly the one 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> had favored. They also <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> they were entitled to get 
              rid of competing ideas and the people that propagated them. How 
              does a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> change from this condition into one in which we understand 
              that there is this fundamental uncertainty? How do we avoid the 
              illusion of certainty to produce the understanding that everything, 
              whether it be a medical test or deciding on the best cure for a 
              particular kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, has a fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> of uncertainty?</p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, I've worked with physicians and physician-patient 
              associations to try to teach the acceptance of uncertainty and the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able way to deal with it. Take HIV testing as an example. 
              Brochures published by the Illinois Department of Health say that 
              testing positive for HIV means that you have the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. Thus, if 
              you are an average person who is not in a particular risk group 
              but test positive for HIV, this might lead you to choose to commit 
              suicide, or move to California, or do something else quite drastic. 
              But AIDS <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in many countries is running on the illusion 
              of certainty. The actual situation is rather like this: If you have 
              about 10,000 people who are in no risk group, one of them will have 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, and will test positive with practical certainty. Among 
              the other 9,999, another one will test positive, but it's a false 
              positive. In this case we have two who test positive, although only 
              one of them actually has the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. Knowing about these very simple 
              things can prevent serious disasters, of which there is unfortunately 
              a record.</p>
<p>Still, medical societies, <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> doctors, and <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> patients 
              either produce the illusion of certainty or want it. Everyone knows 
              Benjamin Franklin's adage that there is nothing certain in this 
              world except <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> and taxes, but the doctors I interviewed tell 
              me something different. They say, "If I would tell my patients 
              what we don't know, they would get very nervous, so it's better 
              not to tell them." Thus, this is one <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant area in which 
              there is a need to get people&#8212;including <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> doctors 
              or lawyers in court&#8212;to be mature citizens and to help them 
              understand and communicate risks.</p>
<p>Representation of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant. In the case of many 
              so-called cognitive illusions, the problem results from difficulties 
              that arise from getting along with probabilities. The problem largely 
              disappears the moment you give the person the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in natural 
              frequencies. You basically put the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> back in a situation where 
              it's much easier to understand these probabilities. We can prove 
              that natural frequencies can facilitate actual <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s, and 
              have known for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that representations&#8212;whether they 
              be probabilities, frequencies or odds&#8212;have an impact on the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. There are very few theories about how this works.</p>
<p>I'll give you a couple of examples relating to medical care. In 
              the US and many European countries, women who are 40 years old are 
              told to participate in mammography screening. Say that a woman takes 
              her first mammogram and it comes out positive. She might ask the 
              physician, "What does that mean? Do I have breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>? Or 
              are my chances of having it 99%, 95%, or 90% or only 50%? What do 
              we know at this point?" I have put the same question to radiologists 
              who have done mammography screening for 20 or 25 years, including 
              chiefs of departments. A third said they would tell this woman that, 
              given a positive mammogram, her chance of having breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> is 
              90%.</p>
<p>However, what happens when they get additional relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>? 
              The chance that a woman in this age group has <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> is roughly 
              1%. If a woman has breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, the probability that she will 
              test positive on a mammogram is 90%. If a woman does not have breast 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, the probability that she nevertheless tests positive is 
              some 9%. In technical terms, you have a base rate of 1%, a sensitivity 
              or hit rate of 90%, and a false positive rate of about 9%. So, how 
              do you answer this woman who's just tested positive for <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>? 
              As I just said, about a third of the physicians thinks it's 90%, 
              another third thinks the answer should be something between 50% 
              and 80%, and another third thinks the answer is between 1% and 10%. 
              Again, these are professionals with many years of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. It's 
              hard to imagine a larger variability in physicians' judgments&#8212; 
              between 1% and 90%&amp;#8212and if patients knew about this variability, 
              they would not be very happy. This situation is typical of what 
              we know from laboratory <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s: namely, that when people encounter 
              probabilities&#8212;which are technically conditional probabilities&#8212;their 
              minds are clouded when they try to make an inference.</p>
<p>What we do is to teach these physicians tools that change the representation 
              so that they can see through the problem. We don't send them to 
              a statistics course, since they wouldn't have the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to go in 
              the first place, and most likely they wouldn't understand it because 
              they would be taught probabilities again. But how can we help them 
              to understand the situation?</p>
<p>Let's change the representation using natural frequencies, as if 
              the physician would have observed these patients him- or herself. 
              One can communicate the same <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the following, much 
              more simple way. Think about 100 women. One of them has breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>. 
              This was the 1%. She likely tests positive; that's the 90%. Out 
              of 99 who do not have breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> another 9 or 10 will test positive. 
              So we have one in 9 or 10 who tests positive. How many of them actually 
              has <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>? One out of ten. That's not 90%, that's not 50%, that's 
              one out of ten.</p>
<p>Here we have a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that enables physicians to see through the 
              fog just by changing the representation, turning their innumeracy 
              into insight. Many of these physicians have carried this innumeracy 
              around for decades and have tried to hide it. When we interview 
              them, they obviously admit it, saying, "I don't know what to 
              do with these <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s. I always confuse these things." Here 
              we have a chance to use very simple tools to help those patients 
              and physicians to understand what the risks are and which enable 
              them to have a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able reaction to what to do. If you take the 
              perspective of a patient&#8212;that this test means that there is 
              a 90% chance you have <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>&#8212;you can imagine what <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in, <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s that do not help her to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> the right way. But 
              informing her that only one out of ten women who tests positive 
              actually has <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> would help her to have a cooler attitude and 
              to make more <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able decisions.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>All my life I have practised probability, as the basis of taking very important decisions.
<br>
For example, when I was in Dar-es-Salaam, in Tanzania, East Africa, I had to decide whether I should buy a car or depend on the company car for transport. Although, buying Car was very attractive, the company financing it, and I could take it back to India, where Imported Cars at that time fetched a huge premium, I decided against it.
<br>
The basis was simple probability calculation of Car Fatalities due to Road Accidents- most accidents taking place due to drunken driving at speed by local drivers. My worst fears were confirmed a few months later when the Prime Minister of the countrywas killed in an accident, on the same road/ place where I was planning to drive for next three years.
<br>
The next example, is even more interesting.
<br>
I ran a life expectancy test based on life style and probability of dying - taking into accont, smoking,dringing, excercises, diabetes, heart, blood pressure etc. into account.
<br>
The chart predicted a life expectancy of 400 weeks, as remaining life. ( This(Death) was to come when I was going to be 70 in December 2001.)
<br>
<br>
I have a very good medical history, with no heart trouble, blood pressure, or related diseases.
<br>
Then exactly in November 2001, when Iwas on my way to an International Seminar on 'Mobility-Transportation Model', I suddenly collapsed, while a Delhi Road, with the famous Killer Bus roaring towards me.
<br>
The traffic stopped in time, and I was taken to the hospital, where a Pacemaker was installed, connecting my heart to a battery, which is sending timing signal/ electric shock to my heart and I am fine now.
<br>
<br>
Well, the probability of a test for prediction of life expectancy being so accurate is very low.
<br>
Exactly that is the point. 
<br>
However, today I am alive, after having been clinically and predictably dead, only because I used the science of probability to decide my course of action in real time and in real life.. 
<br>
Only becuse i didnot die in a road accident in Africa, and got medical help-'pacemaker' in time.
