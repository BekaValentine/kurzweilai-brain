<div class="TeaserText">Molecular manufacturing coupled with AI could bring about a "personal manufacturing" revolution and a new era of abundance. But abundance could be highly disruptive, so we need to design a new economics of abundance so society is prepared for it.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Originally published in </i><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">Perception</a>s: A Review 
              of Ultraprecision <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering and Nanotechnology, Volume 2, No. 
              2<i>, May 8, 2006. Reprinted May 9, 2006 by KurzweilAI.net.</i></p>
<p>For centuries, we have built cultures and economies around scarcity. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">Economics</a> is the "study of how <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings allocate scarce 
              resources"<sup>1</sup> in the most efficient way and conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> agrees that regulated <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> results in the most efficient 
              allocation of those scarce resources. </p>
<p>But what happens if resources are not scarce? What economic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              would we use to allocate <i>plentiful</i> resources? Is there even 
              a point to talking about the &#8220;economics of abundance&#8221; 
              in a culture where economic equations are entirely oriented around 
              scarcity? As Chris Anderson, editor of <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i> magazine says, 
              "My college textbook, Gregory Mankiw's otherwise excellent 
              <i>Principles of Economics</i>, doesn't mention the word abundance. 
              And for good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>: If you let the scarcity term in most economic 
              equations go to nothing, you get all sorts of divide-by-zero problems. 
              They basically blow up."<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>We are on the cusp of a new era that has the potential to be an 
              era of abundance. In the coming decades, molecular manufacturing 
              will be a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. The Nanotechnology Glossary<sup>3</sup> defines 
              molecular manufacturing as "the automated building of products 
              from the bottom up, <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> by molecule, with atomic precision. 
              This will make products that are extremely lightweight, flexible, 
              durable, and potentially very 'smart'." And cheap. Just as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> enabled personal publishing by marrying the Postscript <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> 
              with the Macintosh <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> and an inexpensive LaserWriter <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>, 
              so will the coupling of molecular manufacturing with appropriate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming tools bring about a revolution we might call "personal 
              manufacturing." Such personal nanofactories (PNs) already have 
              been envisioned and are likely to be similar in look and ease of 
              use to a printer or microwave oven. Indeed, an artist's <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              can be seen at http://<a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">www</a>.foresight.org/nano/nanofactory.<a class="thought" href="entries/html_entry.html">html</a></p>
<p>The advent of PNs should bring the cost of most nonfood necessities 
              to near zero. Much of the raw material for most <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s we commonly 
              use can be found in air and dirt, with a few fortified materials 
              thrown in. If we build things from the molecules up (and conversely, 
              break things down into their <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> molecules for reuse), materials 
              cost will nearly disappear. <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> would then become the most 
              expensive resource. Meanwhile, computing power&#8212;information 
              management&amp;#8212continues to expand exponentially even as its cost 
              drops precipitously. Furthermore, as true <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              (AI) approaches, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will become self-programming, and information 
              cost may drop even more dramatically. It's already happening. Today, 
              most of our products contain greater and greater information <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>) at lesser and lesser cost. It appears that even food 
              eventually could be manufactured on the kitchen countertop personal 
              at practically no materials cost.</p>
<p>However, if <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is a guide, the "haves" will always 
              want to have more and the "have&#173;nots" will end up 
              getting relatively less. That is the way many people keep score&amp;#8212as 
              the bumper sticker wisdom goes, "He who dies with the most 
              toys wins." It's not just a silly ditty. It is a frank statement 
              of the mindset of many <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s. And it is the "haves" 
              that possess easy <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the levers of power and legislation. 
              In a system based on scarcity, those holding the levers of production 
              will not easily give them up. In domestic and international markets 
              based on scarcity, the function and responsibility of directors 
              and officers is to maximize shareholder value&amp;#8212at nearly any 
              cost that does not fall afoul of laws, or at least not so far afoul 
              that the penalties exceed the financial gain resulting from illegal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s.</p>
<p>So, what kind of culture do we want? In a system of plenty, will 
              we continue to keep score by maintaining the preponderance of benefits 
              inside <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> walls and coffers? Will we continue to stifle the 
              spread of benefits through secrecy and protectionism? Unless something 
              changes, history suggests that laws, regulations, and protections 
              will continue to be designed for the exact purpose of directing 
              all profits and the virtually all of benefits to shareholders.</p>
<p>Is it possible to change this historical trend? Is it desirable? 
              What would an economy based on abundance look like? What would we 
              call it? Could we convince the lawmakers, the regulators, and those 
              who currently benefit most from a system based on scarcity to relinquish 
              what has worked so well for them?</p>
<p>I maintain that it <i>is</i> desirable and that we <i>must</i> 
              drive toward an outcome whereby the benefits of molecular manufacturing 
              accrue to the greatest <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people. War, <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, and business 
              drive my reasoning.</p>
<p>To date, all our technological and economic <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> has produced 
              a world at war and in poverty. War is largely fought over scarce 
              resources. Widespread <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> (through universal distribution of 
              PNs) would remove the apparent fuel for most wars.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>The World Bank estimates that 2.7 billion humans live below a level 
              necessary to meet <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> needs. The organization says that this kind 
              of poverty includes hunger, lack of shelter, no access to <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>s, 
              and losing a child to illness brought about by unclean water.<sup>5</sup> 
              Few would argue that human misery is desirable. PNs could be programmed 
              to provide basic building supplies, medicine, foodstuffs, and clean 
              water.</p>
<p>As regards business, I believe we can convince a wide range of 
              enterprises, from local to transnational, that maximizing the benefits 
              for billions of people (read: "customers") simultaneously 
              maximizes value for shareholders...in the long run.</p>
<p>However, nearly all businesses act primarily in the interest of 
              the short term. Corporate directors cannot allow a departure from 
              known short-term profit centers in the market without assistance 
              from legislation and regulators to flatten the playing field for 
              all. Even Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, is calling 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> to incentivize his industry to produce environmentally 
              friendly technology<sup>6</sup>&#8212;ostensibly, so his firm can 
              afford to produce such vehicles while staying competitive with other 
              auto manufacturers.</p>
<p>We must incentivize, strongly encourage, or require the broad sharing 
              of the benefits of early-onset molecular manufacturing advances 
              and breakthroughs so that the long-term benefits can be realized. 
              This discussion needs to happen now, before entrenched interests 
              develop protections and harden regulations adapted for maximum short-term 
              profits while stifling innovation. Market forces can be too slow. 
              What's needed is a means to produce broad and inexpensive licensing 
              so that early breakthroughs in molecular manufacturing can quickly 
              benefit a broad swath of humanity.</p>
<p>Over hundreds of years, we have developed the skills of how to 
              allocate things in short supply. For widespread abundance, we have 
              no <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, no projections, and no economic calculations. Abundance, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>ically, could be highly disruptive. It is <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to design 
              a new economics of abundance, so that abundance can be enjoyed in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> that is prepared for it.</p>

  All we need is a free market with honest pricing and without fraud.
<br>
  Those two essentials do not exist in today's US economy.  Honest pricing for commodities goes out the window when forward contract selling by those without the ability to produce or the inventory on hand is allowed.
<br>
  Fraud in the stock markets is wide spread by allowing the selling of conterfit stock which the SEC gives a pass to.
<br>
  The next element of fraud to be eliminated is the legalized fraud of selling borrowed stocks.
<br>
  And the mother of legalized fraud that must be eliminated is the ability of the banking industry to create money at will.

<br>
<br>
I don't believe that there is or can be such a thing as a completely free market. A truly free market will quickly evolve/devolve into a few monopolies and no longer be free to new entries. A market only exists within regulations that establish the parameters and rules of the market. I realize that you did not say "completely free market" and so may not have meant that, however. 
<br>
<br>
I wonder what constitutes "honest pricing." How do we arrive at this number?
<br>
<br>
In the US version of a free market (a misnomer at best), "forward contract selling" is a market itself. Should the free market that you would design restrict this aspect of the market?
<br>
<br>
You mention "those without the ability to produce." To my way of thinking, personal nanofactories will put the means of production into everyone's hands. Would this change your calculus?
<br>
<br>
You mention that the ability to make the necessary changes you suggest is easy with today's technology. But of course, this essay is about what we do with tomorrow's technology.
<br>
<br>
You are willing to show how to accomplish your aims to people with power to do something about them. Who that is might be a pretty interesting discussion all by itself. Why not put up a blog &amp; not tell everyone - it may then have a better chance of reaching the right people.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Where did you learn that there can be no such thing as a completely free market?  Please explain why this is the case.  My understanding of economic theory is that a monoply can be maintained only WITH goverment support.
<br>
Your thoughts on monoplies sound like propoganda for government medling.  Governments only effort in the economic arena is to punish fraud and theft and assure that exchange rules are followed.
<br>
<br>
'honest pricing' results when anyone selling something they do not own and cannot create under the terms of the conditions of the sale is convicted of the crime of fraud.  The enforcement must be strong and the punishment must be severe so that the practice of fraudlent selling is so rare as to not distort the market price which is reached by a willing and honest seller and a willing buyer with the means to pay the agreed price.  Margined buying where the loaner can dictate a forced sale must also be prohibited.  If a broker or banker agrees to loan money it should be tied to a specified asset such as 'n shares of x corp.'  Then if the borrower chooses to stop making payments on the loan the specified asset can be seized.  Are you aware of the vast amount of conterfit stocks being sold which the SEC does little to prohibit?
<br>
<br>
An 'ability to produce' is based on having done so.  Rules would allow someone with a record of having produced an amount of something can then contract to sell that amount for future delivery in a regulated commodity market.
<br>
<br>
Let me know if you find the above responsive.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It would seem to me that whilst the economics of abundance is a laudable idea and, in the event of abundance being an actual reality, very much needed I have a suspicion that there is a little of 'putting the cart before the horse' in the concept.
<br>
<br>
By this I mean that economics is a result of social behaviour. True that social behaviour is based upon the availability or otherwise of resources, but whilst technology may well provide us with a major transition in the physical world, the individual and social world of scarcity is deeply ingrained and not so easily adjusted.
<br>
<br>
This mindset is ingrained into everything about human society. It is how we feel better about ourselves - i.e. "I'm better looking" "I'm smarter than you" "My job title is more important than yours" "My golf clubs cost more than yours" and so on and so on. The phenomenon of trading up in the purchasing process is driven by this basic need to "be better" than others as a way of self approval. Follow this on to the social behaviour of groups "My business club is better than yours" "My gang is better than yours" and so on.. and on to countries "We are the best in the world" "God is on our side" - it is inherent in the basic processes for self approval of humans on every level.
<br>
<br>
Should abundance occur, this way of being by humans is not going to change at the same rate. (And some may argue, given the history of the last few thousands of years, that at a fundamental level it doesn't and won't change one whit.) While humans derive strength to their ego structures (both at individual and group levels) by "having more" in some way, no matter how 'abundant' the possible physical reality is, mankind will regulate it to meet its emotional and psychological make-up - if you look around you, you will find that occurs today.</p></td>

I think that it is important to note that what you said is very true in strong capitalistic societies and much less so as the economic engine swings towards societies strongly based on socialism and finally on the other extreme, communism.  
<br>
<br>
From a strategic perspective China is in a much stronger long term position than America and their economic model and values are VERY different from ours. That being the case I am not very confident our values and behaviors will be necessarily be the dominate ones when these changes occur.
<br>
<br>
From a historic perspective America is very much playing the role of the latter day Roman empire.  We have savages at our borders and we are stretched too thin.  China is the sleeping giant that just may end up replacing us.
<br>
<br>
Even without our own society there is much more thought and energy being put into functional realities and a let less into flash and bling... children excluded of course.</p></td>

My thoughts on this currently are that it has not. China is, historically, a feudalist and very much a capitalist society. I don't see that this has been changed within the fundamental ambitions of the Chinese people with the imposition of communism. Indeed, one can point to cities such as Shanghai to  suggest that once the imposition of the communist government structures are lifted (which I would personally argue are simply an extension of feudalism minus the capitalist processes for the individual - but that's another discussion), the Chinese (as a people) leap back into their historically capitalist perspective and modus operandi that would make the most right wing capitalists of the western world proud.

I would agree, but I think this has more to do with availability of resources and the fear of death (by the lack there of), triggering this natural instinct in us.  
<br>
<br>
You and I are sharing knowledge back and forth and neither of us feels as though we are losing value or worth.  In fact, both of us are gaining value (in knowledge), as the result of this dialog.  This same dynamic is what is at play today with software (open source), wikipedia, myspace etc..  The day we can convert a bucket of dirt into anything of equivalent mass is the day we as the human race will see tangible goods in the same way as we do the sharing of ideas.  
<br>
<br>
There is really only one danger I see to the above becoming true and that's over population and/or unequal distribution of matter.  Both of these issues could easily be solved by controlling population growth and forming a collective consensus to decide what "fair is".  I note that both of these key concepts have more in common with socialism than capitalism.  Honestly though, being the good capitalist that you are which would you rather.
<br>
<br>
First assume we have the technology to convert any matter into anything else.  The methods / ideas for these conversions are shared freely online between everyone as they are developed by everyone in the Open.
<br>
<br>
1) Now would you rather live in a world where society governs itself through true digital consensus.  Where population is kept reasonable so that natural resources can be distributed evenly and every man women and child has an earth sized chunk of matter to mold in any shape they wish.
<br>
<br>
or
<br>
<br>
2) Live in a world where Americas capitalist elitism determines the hierarchy.  Where the lower, middle and likely even the upper-middle class is no longer needed. Where the existing powers (i.e. top .01%) combine together to claim the solar systems resources to divide them up among themselves.
<br>
<br>
Capitalism/trade/barter like systems are REQUIRED for a healthy growing society when scarcity and survival is a daily concern.  I have no doubt that this is true.  However, the needed balance these systems provide begins to change as a society moves further and further away from just trying to survive another day.  
<br>
<br>
When technology is such where I have the means to manufacture anything that I and my community of friends can imagine then the game changes. Capitalism is now the enemy, as are any who wish to keep me and the larger community in a position of weakness.  It no longer becomes about who earned what they have, it is now purely a game of who is in control, those with advantage or society as whole without preference.   
<br>
<br>
In my opinion the only reason capitalism still works well today is because.
<br>
<br>
a) Many people are uneducated and have been conditioned by society to be lazy and have not discovered a purpose that they believe in.
<br>
<br>
b) The world is over populated and there is not enough abundance of basic resources to provide the level of security required to appease the human fear of death.
<br>
<br>
The day will become where the zero sum game that we have been playing will either be the death of most or the day we all regain true freedom and evolve as a society.</p></td>

While I agree with you that there are certainly signs of unfettered dissemination (I so hope my spelling is ok) of information etc such as the open software movement (of which I am very supportive) and which occur because those providing such products have other means by which they can feed themselves - I must return to my original point in reply.  That is, that there is a fundamental instinct to elevate oneself by comparing oneself to others and seeing oneself as somehow 'greater' - even to the point of "aren't we wonderful.. we're more altruistic than all of those other rabid captialitsts' (ok.. slightly over the top but you get my point).  This self patting on the back applies to all forms of government and human endeavour.  Look at the enormous popularity of gaming - it is about competing, having 'more powers' etc, than others. This inherent drive to self adulation by the use of external markers has enabled the human race to survive and flourish.  I am not saying that this is justification for this modus operandi to continue, rather, I am saying that this modus operandi is so pervasive (down to the minute of our daily lives) that, even in a world of abundance, this need (unless modified or transformed) will create the new economics. So I suspect, ultimately, that we are driving at different points (though I could be wrong - online converstation can sometimes cause problems due to the loss of subtle nuance).  
<br>
<br>
My point boils down to: the physical reality may change, but it will be the internal emotional motivators of humans that will create the economic environment. Until the internal emotional motivators are re-aligned and are no longer built upon scarcity, humans will continuously self sabotage 'abundance'. </p></td>

<br>
Open source and wikipedia are good examples to present as to how our emotional / natural competitive nature is focused in a society based on abundance.  As anyone who participates in these communities deeply will be sure to tell you, we are some of the most competitive and egotistical human beings on the planet, bar none. However this is countered by the fact that we as a community self organize based on peer respect.  In other words respect and the self acknowledgement of a job well done is our currency, as it is with video games I might add.
<br>
<br>
So as you see, you are right this part of human nature does not change at all.  It's focus however is based on esteem, both internal and external and through this process one discovers what it really means to be part of a community that is based purely and mutal respect and where all social structure follows a meritoracy like model, evolving in a way that would make Darwin himself proud. </p></td>

This is not true. The majority of the people who developing open source software are paid by someone else to write it.  The other 45% or so do it either because they enjoy it, are building a reputation among their peers or for education purposes.  In other words its no different than anything else.

Perhaps.  My point was two fold.
<br>
<br>
1) That once the basic humans needs for security are met we have a tendency to self select purposes that often times are helpful to society at large where our reward is personal and peer esteem.
<br>
<br>
2) I had thought you were saying the Open Source development model would not be self sustaining unless people "gave" their time and energy "freely" and without reward.  If you were not saying that you have my apologies.  A common myth is that open source software is only sustainable by robing the left over energy from "real" economic endeavors.</p></td>

<br>
Another point that perhaps is not clear.  If you have an issue, a bug or a feature that is missing from an application that you use.  In an open source software economy you have a number of options to address this issue.
<br>
<br>
1) You can open your phone book and find a programmer and pay them to solve the problem.
<br>
<br>
2) You can spend the required effort to solve it yourself
<br>
<br>
3) You and others who have the same issue can pool together and hire developers and/or pay a company that specializes in this.
<br>
<br>
As you see this process does not work based on "abundance" in the sense you seem to be implying.     In this case you have a issue that you want resolved, for personal or professional it does not matter, you and perhaps others exchange your life energy in the form of cash for another's life energy in the form of software modification.
<br>
<br>
The only difference between this and you hiring someone to repair your roof is that the materials for your roof are expensive while the materials for software is so low it is easily over looked.</p></td>

<br>
I think this is the wrong question.  A better question is at what point does the average human being have enough physical security where his personal survival no longer dominate his thoughts and actions. 
<br>
<br>
Once this threshold is met we can start focusing on the system for distributing "freedom" as a tangible resource.  Freedom in this sense is the ability to experience / express above and beyond what is required for survival and peace of mind.  
<br>
<br>
Many humans will never be content to just "live" without fear.  Many will want to "Experience" as much as possible.  The economics and laws of abundance then should be focused on insuring no persons ambition/freedom threatens another's survival.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
indeed we all can try to discover what these 'minds' are able to create or do. at least they deserve an opportunity to improve their standard of living. until then, i am considering that something serious is failing in the human evolution'.
<br>
<br>
two points: 
<br>
a. children adoption
<br>
b. hydrogen energy democratic WORLDWIDEWEB DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<br>
<br>
a)  there should be an international worldwide agreement that favoured the adoption of childrens of the third world or simply childrens abandoned by their parents (due to lack of economical resources or any other causes'). today there are many families that wish to adopt childrens, but there are a lot of long / complex legal / costly processes and lack of information that simply difficult the intention to adopt or simply do not encourage the possible adoptive parents to take a decision for adoption.
<br>
<br>
 '. of course there must be a control to avoid abuse and fraud. but a simple/effective/well implemented/documented worldwide  agreement for adoption could help to reduce the scarcity of these childrens. 
<br>
<br>
one universal jurisdiction for adoption should exist.
<br>
..and the parents /or single people wishing to adopt wouldn't need to be  rich, if an intelligent adoption program would really be implemented '.
<br>
<br>
b) recently i read an article about the likely transition to a hydrogen economy. indeed, billions of dollars have been invested in the research and development of technologies by space industry, army, universities, the automotive industry and the oil multinationals.
<br>
<br>
brian mcgormick of general motors calls the HYDROGEN REVOLUTION OF SOMETHING UTMOST IMPORTANT !!
<br>
<br>
quote:
<br>
'hydrogen is clean. it produces only water. nonetheless the electrolytic process to seperate hydrogen from oxygen needs energy. the rentability is a bit better than those of fossil fuels, but not impressive. alone when produced by renewable sources hydrogen becomes 100% safe for the environment. not only for the environment. hydrogen can become a blessing for the sunny-, windy- and mountain-rich parts of the world which are mostly in third world areas. these countries can make money out of their renewable sources by producing and exporting hydrogen. megacities, centers of energy in energy low areas loose an important part of their attraction as energy will be available at every place in the world.
<br>
<br>
hydrogen can reduce the centralised energy distribution, with its mega-power-stations to a much smaller, a human scale. when each car runs on hydrogen fuel cells, this will be used as a private power station, with a unit that produces 25kw. these 25kw are necessary for the power peaks of the car, the moments of acceleration, high speed. the car produces much more than it needs and the car is out of use for 96% of its lifetime. this extra energy and the energy which can be produced in the time the car is parked can be delivered to the house, to neighbours, to ones business.
<br>
<br>
hydrogen experts in the united states are convinced that the combination of hydrogen, fuel-cells, electricity distribution networks, and computer networks can have people a full say over their energy production. THEY IMAGINE A WORLD WIDE HYDROGEN WEB, A GLOBAL NETWORK FOR ENERGY DISTRIBUTION WHICH CONNECTS ALL THE SMALLER AND BIGGER PRODUCERS. JUST LIKE THE ENERGY MARKET BETWEEN BIG COMPANIES FUNCTIONS THESE DAYS. IT WILL BE POSSIBLE THAT IT IS YOU WHO DECIDE WHERE THE EXTRA ENERGY YOU PRODUCE WILL BE DELIVERED TO AND TO WHAT PARTS OF THE WORLD.'

How do we minimize the impact of abundance?
<br>
- Provide basic needs to all people without cost, consequence or limit: Food, shelter, communication, transportation, and healthcare
<br>
- Automate innovation to ensure its continuance
<br>
- Encourage alternate mating and status preferences to include abilities such as nurturing and innovation

You say, "relationship information is less likely to be shared, and therefor will be more valued." I may be getting your meaning totally wrong, but isn't relationship the big new thing in websites? I'm thinking in particular of MySpace, YouTube, and others of their ilk (even KurzweilAI). These sites are valuable due in large part to the relationships created, yet they are free, and people freely give their information and contributions to receive others' information and relationship in return. No money is exchanged by the users, but value is.
<br>
So,do you mean this kind of value, or are you referring to pecuniary compensation?
<br>
<br>
You ask, "How do we minimize the impact of abundance?" I wonder if we want to minimize the impact...perhaps maximizing the impact, while economically disruptive, might create a better world. </p></td>

I wouldn't for instance share my relationship with my daughter with anyone.  I believe you are thinking of developing a relationship.  I meant litterally sharing a relationship.  We need to be thinking of data, and all data as just that.  A relationship will become data.  That doesn't just mean that I can transfer this data.  It also means you can use it and live it.  The day will come when people begin to "be" one another.  This mingling of selves will be much greater than the data someone is willing to post on a web site.

<br>
My choice of words was poor, I should have stated something more like, how could we minimize the initial negative impacts of abundance.
<br>
<br>
The impact of abundance may have wonderful charachteristics however if for instance innovation is automated prior to ensuring all people are clothed and fed.  The wealthy could ensure the distruction of all others in order to retain power and ensure they will be clothed and fed.  If however starvation and death are mute, then automating innovation cannot hold power over lives.  Introduction of a new abundance economy needs to be done with caution.

"Abundance" in the context of New Economics I think though is a different concept, and that is a life which is not restricted to the maintenance of the basic human needs and allows one to make a contribution to the larger well being of ones community.  That community can be as small as the day care and senior care centers in your town. To the feeding of children flung in faraway lands through charity. </p></td>

<br>
I would challenge that.  Much of this "weight problem" in my opinion has to do with WHAT your average American eats. Many / most Americans eat foods that are a balance between affordable and "tastes good". So what did our economy do?  It figured out that synthetic garbage can be made cheaply and with the right chemical makeup can be made to "Taste good". At least to those who cannot afford more traditional "Tastes good" food.
<br>
<br>
I do not agree with the "just because most Americans are fat" that we are economically well balanced or are a good example of what a society with abundance would/should look like</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>An economy of abundance, where material goods can be produced on a whim and where nanotechnology has eliminated the entirety of traditional economic processes has one clear side effect:
<br>
<br>
For all that we will be producing, we will need plans, blueprints, instructions.
<br>
<br>
As we have moved from a second wave society to a third wave society, we have lost the need for manufacturing to be our primary economic activity. We are no longer focused on making things, instead we are a service economy, a knowledge economy, etc.
<br>
<br>
In the age of abundance this will be the only economy. When we have nanofactories and such to produce things on a whim, we will become immensely reliant on the designs for those things, just as today we are immensely reliant on the designs for the things that we have manufactured elsewhere.
<br>
<br>
The Economy of Abundance will be of physical items. The Economy of Scarcity will continue to exist, but only in terms of the innovative and novel designs for things. We will continue to have scarce resources, but they will be mental resources. Scarcity of ingenuity, scarcity of genius, scarcity of ideas.</p></td>

You left out a key variables in your statement.  
<br>
<br>
Physical resources are "rivalrous" in that one person owning the resource or consuming that resource effectively restricts another from using/consuming that same resource.  It is in this sense that scarcity is important in economics.
<br>
<br>
The economics around ideas are not "rivalrous" in this sense.  In fact there is much evidence (see open source software development) that suggests production systems based 99% on ideas alone increase in efficiency the MORE it is shared / consumed.

Will we trust a Boeing to be built from open source designs that the manufacturer got from the internet? Will we fly on that plane or will we say "I don't know whether the design is reliable or not. I'm going to fly on official Boeing planes, designed by Boeing engineers." The same goes for anything else. People will rely on "genuine" designs from companies they know they can rely on. Some groups might produce reliable, safe, free designs that people will be able to use, but I doubt that the majority of things will be free. If for nothing more than brand/label people will buy the designs rather than get them for free, just like they do today. And infact, that might be precisely the reason why the scarcity of knowledge remains a driving force: your monetary wealth will be very obvious if you're using products who's designs are free, as opposed to expensive.

You already do.  Do you have any idea how many devices have Linux embedded in them today?  Half of the gear Cisco sells is now Linux inside. You can say the same for many products from IBM, Sony, Motorola, Samsung to name but a few.  You as a consumer will trust whatever it is you experience to be trust worthy.  As our children grow up in a society where the majority of all content whether it be pure information or software is developed and distributed by the larger community it will be the old model of development that is watched with a wary eye.  Who exactly do you think develops Open Source software?   I will give you a hint.. over half of the people who write the code these days are employed by the above mentioned companies.  The other half are people who have earned the respect of their peers through excellence.  What in this is not to trust? It is trusted by the American government enough to have it chosen as the operating system for our Future infantry combat armor and communication system.

The day your average person can take a pile of dirt and convert it into anything they want is the day the Open Source Economy begins.  Sure some groups will produce great things while others will produce crap, this is the same as it always has been.  People will gravitate towards the great and ignore the crap like always.

The majority of the Internet runs on Open source, Linux is one of the most reliable operating systems in existence and it is also one of the youngest. The Internet is by far the most complicated piece of engineering Man has ever created.  It says something that a model like Open Source can not only compete with the richest company in the world, but a monopoly at that and in a society where IP laws make it very difficult.
<br>
<br>
Open source software is developed in the open for all people who are interested to see what should or should not be trusted.  I fail to see how your vision of the future fits the current trends.</p></td>

And why not?  What other human invention has more   dependencies and complexities?  Even if you only take into account the formal protocols:
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090226200634/http://www.ietf.org/iesg/1rfc_index.txt" target="_blank">http://www.ietf.org/iesg/1rfc_index.txt</a>
<br>
<br>
It is amazingly large and complex.  Now you could argue that the Internet is actually many inventions connected together, but you could say the same thing about the Space shuttle. 
<br>
<br>
Or to put it another way.  More human creativity (measured in hours) has been spent adding to the things we call "The Internet" than any other singular human created "thing".  We are adding to it at this very moment.</p></td>

Therefore I would argue that instead of looking for an economics of abundance we should ask about what will be different in a "lifestyle" of relative abundance.  It's not so much that our economy will shift in nature as much as it will shift in scope.  Certain things to which our relationship are now defined by scarcity will exit from the stage of economics and enter the definedly (sort of made up a word there) different stage of abundance.
<br>
<br>
Our minds will, of course, need something to strive for and hence we will probably spend our daily budget of worry on meaning and positive impact.  I would agree with whomever it was before that said relationships may become the most valuable commodity.  Interestingly enough, though, they can't be traded.  Or perhaps there are other things which we will find to trade with one another. . . or perhaps because of the non-exclusivity of non-material goods economics will just die a quiet and peaceful death.  The way to attack this question, i would say, is to have a look at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090226200634/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of  _needs</a> and ask ourselves:  what of these needs will be satsified by universal abundance of material goods, and which will not?  Of those that will not, which can we specialize in producing for trade?  If there are any, then those will comprise the new economy; if there are none then economics will become a forgotten word.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>i found the impact on economics by Singularity technology (ST) sooo massive I had to plan for it with our Club's project to build SAI.
<br>
<br>
I recruited a former chief UN economist and then replaced her with a Priceton PhD in Economics.
<br>
<br>
They had to specifically adress the probelm of what money was goping to do at the singularity approached.
<br>
<br>
Consensus was that some form of  of exchange woulod still happen.
<br>
<br>
Maslow's pyramid of needs..hi Lucius might be completely diffrent.
<br>
<br>
The club divided into those who thought our goals would always be a massive influence on how we turned out, and those who thought we couldn't predict WHAT we turn out as.
<br>
<br>
<br>
There was an arguement that economics must become a pure scsince.
<br>
<br>
That there was a perfect and logical 'reactive' was the term used, way top barter - with or without a curency.
<br>
<br>
I wondered if something had to emerge as an evolution FROMM currency, but never found what it could be, it after a hunt.
<br>
<br>
Money is going to be crucial as we head into ST but as it is reached will rapidly diminish in  importance, is one pretty well thought out idea.
<br>
<br>
John MacCarthy had predicted that computing/information procesing power would become a comonidt/currency  (this is 1970).
<br>
<br>
I no longer think this is possible because it reduces to data manipulation and systems are in plan/build that do that for a fraction of the then estimated cost.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the whol of economics may then become 
<br>
<br>
energy + ability to manip[ulate it.
<br>
<br>
Which is strange because that's exactly what earth liofe forms do.
<br>
<br>
You can extend that analogy futher.
<br>
<br>
Money/economics may become a vital artery in the way being communicate and exist.
<br>
<br>
I think I there would be devastation were the finance system to collapse now, becaise welath equates with territory which equates with mates/reproduction etc and other p[rogrammes in pur genes.
<br>
<br>
On economist said in 199/2000 as the dom com crash was about happeneing, that it was ridiculous that there could be a dperession like 1929, because we understand economics  now.
<br>
<br>
i was agog at that...remembereing the titanic.
<br>
<br>
But it seems that was the case.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In a world of abundance, how come 3% of people own 1/2 the globe?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>First, being a physicist with some background in biochemistry and computer science, I have little doubt that humanity will soon control biology at the cellular level, likely making bio-nano bots become our ultimate, universal constructors.  Whether this will lead to gray goo or utopia I can't say--we may yet be squashed by a BIG meteor hidden by the sun next week--SPLAT!
<br>
<br>
Should we survive being flattened or being disassembled one molecule at a time, I also have little doubt that humanity is not the final word in Earth-based evolution.  In our quest to solve medical problems (cancer, Alzheimer's, blindness, etc.) bio-nano-quantum computing technologies will change us profoundly someday, likely sooner than later, and sex, drugs, beer and other sundry carnal activities will lose their meaning as we know them.  What super venal replacements "transcended people" will find is beyond speculation, but they will likely be wild beyond our imagination.
<br>
<br>
One "econometric" question I often ponder is who will make it IF we make it?  Will the AIDS stricken Africans make it?  Will only relatively wealthy people make it?  Given the steep price of current invitro fertilization, one question I grappled with at a UN panel on cloning was what will happen when only the richest rich can afford to make super offspring?  What will our kids do to secure their future against super kids?  Will the wealth and power gradients grow so fast that only a tiny fraction of humanity survives Singularity?
<br>
<br>
A great book over which to ponder these points is "War and Peace and War" by Turchin, on the mathematical modeling of the history of the rise and fall of civilizations.  Turchin's book is very accessible, and very compelling, and may lead you to read his more hardcore historical dynamics texts.  The book Citizen Cyborg does a pretty good job on discussing what kind of political systems we should strive for to make sure all make it to Singularity.  I also explore all of these ideas and more in my history-based strong science fiction book Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.

How can we have an economics of abundance, when we (humans) seem always to want more, more, more?
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
This is a common comment I hear, but is it true? Do you not have enough air to breath?  Enough water to drink?  Do you lack sufficient food?  
<br>
<br>
I think it is important to separate "stimulation" from "substance" when discussing the concept of abundance.  Before long we will be able to design methods of hooking you up (or perhaps just uploading you into) a system that provides maximum bliss, something so potent that it makes heroin look like caffeine.  I assure you at this point you will want nothing more, you will have found your Nirvana... What happens to many heroin / drug addicts?  They stop wanting anything but their fix, in affect they are satisfied with less not more.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
Will higher intelligence really solve this tendency? Won't higher intelligence merely want a higher degree of more, more, more?
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
More of what?  Humans like all things that evolve are driven by external pressures, when those pressures are removed or relaxed we stagnate.  There must be external pressures for "progress" to be economically desirable.  
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
Okay, we reproduce the universe. Is THAT enough? No! We then strive to do what?..... gain access to as many alternate universes as possible? Aren't these supposedly infinite; therefore, abundance is always out of reach.
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Whats the point? There is NO evidence that it will even be possible for us to travel between stars and maintain any semblance of continuity let alone between universes. Expansion for expansions sake makes no more sense then more for mores sake does.  There must be reasons (external pressures) to make it economically viable to expand/progress.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
If we have enough, then it seems that we're bored. We create reasons to get........ more, more, more.
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Bored is a lack of stimulation, not a lack of substance.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi purpose,
<br>
<br>
I don't see that you've deconstructed my main point.
<br>
<br>
In fact, you seem to support it.  Pressure to evolve or to create more substance (to me) implies a lack of abundance - an abundance, in fact, that can never be reached, precisely because we continually demand to be under such pressure.
<br>
<br>
You ask me about air, food, shelter, etc.  Yes, I have sufficient quantities of these.  But I do not apply the idea of abundance to these basic requirements of life.  My sense of abundance has a leaning towards opulance, blatant overconsumption beyond what is sufficient for a balanced being (i.e., "happiness").
<br>
<br>
The drive for "economic growth" is precisely such a drive for overabundance, from my perspective.  We don't need all that stuff we make.  We don't need all the people on the earth,... and those people making more babies to make more goods-and-services for more, more, more.
<br>
<br>
The world is a cluttered place.  Lots of roads too narrow, curves badly cut for cars to turn properly, stairwells designed with too short approaches, not enough clearance between buildings, ceilings in many dwellings too low, too little green space in many areas, strip malls, traffic jams............ see where I'm going?
<br>
<br>
We have not perfected the things we invent already, before we think that we are ready to move on.  We fail at making the relationships elegant.  We focus on the growth, the amount of stuff, the abundance of goods.  It's all crap, when we don't look at the relationships and the harmony between the substance we create.

<br>
My goal is not to deconstruct your main point.  You focus on examples where man kind has not yet stagnated, and you focus on our instinctive need to build up our security, by over eating, over stockpiling, over consuming. My point is our motivation for progress is directly related to a tangible "scarcity" that will soon be satiate.  You seem to think there exists a universal/intellectual truth driving us forward, nay it is emotion and emotion alone that leads to the tool of rationality, who's soul purpose is to fulfill our emotions every whim.

<br>
You are historically incorrect IMO.  Every time a society has ever entered an age of "abundance" stagnation is quick to follow.  You see it today in America as we continue to fall behind other countries in info technology... you saw it in the Roman empire where all of its resources were dedicated to "maintain", not to move forward.  
<br>
<br>
Here in America the pressure that does exist today, that keeps us moving forward, is largely driven by the humans who do not have our "abundance" and want it.  For we as a nation (like the Romans) are more concerned with "maintaining" our abundance than we are with moving forward.  This is why we will not have a true economy of abundance until it is available and sustainable for all man kind.

You ask me about air, food, shelter, etc. Yes, I have sufficient quantities of these. But I do not apply the idea of abundance to these basic requirements of life. 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Of course you do not, things that are Non-rivalrous are hardly ever noticed ;).  That is in fact the point, when all things of substance are Non-rivalrous they will be taken for granted and need not be noticed.  The rest is stimulation and remember, this can be achieved cheaply and will be much like air, while not infinite it will be enough.

My sense of abundance has a leaning towards opulance, blatant overconsumption beyond what is sufficient for a balanced being (i.e., "happiness"). 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Interesting, if stimulation = happiness then as soon as we are capable of creating "Nirvana machines" then our quest for "abundance" will be over.  You see this drive that you speak of is not to assimilate the universe, it is to satiate the human animistic need for security, it is our primal fear of death that we seek to over come.  It matters not if you remove this with heroin, a magic machine or sufficient physical "security" in the form of true abundance, the result is the same, stagnation.  For it is this primal fear that drives us and that alone.  This is the primary reason why I feel we will not evolve nearly as fast as Kurzweil thinks, our rate of evolution will slow as the external pressures have less and less power over our security.
<br>
<br>

<br>
The drive for "economic growth" is precisely such a drive for overabundance, from my perspective. We don't need all that stuff we make. We don't need all the people on the earth,... and those people making more babies to make more goods-and-services for more, more, more. 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Our animistic qualities drive us to over stimulate often times to our own detainment. It is also these basic instincts that have kept us alive up until this point.  Like the heroin addict, this animistic need can be satiated cheaply, soon we will be able to maintain this contentment without serious risks.  Many people might not like this view of our nature, this simplistic animal-ism that drives us, I know I do not but it appears true none the less. 
<br>
<br>
Enhanced intelligence will not change this equation. Enhanced intelligence is just another phrase for "enhanced rationality" and like our current rationality it needs the driving force of emotion and thus no matter how much we enhance our "intellectual abilities", it will always be subservient to emotion, either directly or indirectly.</p></td>

I find myself not disagreeing with you.  Again, I think we might be expressing slightly different tones of the same basic idea.
<br>
<br>
I guess I'm just questioning whether the concept of "economics" is even a logical idea, given a sense of abundance where everybody has all they need.  
<br>
<br>
I suggest that ECONOMICS (at this stage of the human condition) is a dead concept.
<br>
<br>
We don't even use the term "economics" at this stage.  It'll be a laughable primitive idea, honed in an age of confusion.
<br>
<br>
But, again, I can't help thinking that intelligence cannot reach such a place, simply because intelligence always requires somewhere else to evolve, meaning... universal abundance is perpetually out of reach.
<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure that the concept of "abundance" has an equal applicability to all things or to all human wants/needs.
<br>
<br>
For example, does it make sense to speak of "abundant air supply" as though this is equivalent to saying "abundant sexual stimulation"?  I don't think so.
<br>
<br>
What do you think?

Yes I would say it is a predictable and constant pattern embeded at the fundamental level of human nature.

<br>
Perhaps, however I do not think the core concept of economics will disappear per say.  Intelligent beings will continue to exchange/trade their life energy in some form or other.  But I agree it will likely be almost unrecognizable compared to today's system.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">

<br>
</p></center>
<br>
But you see evolving is not the goal, satisfaction is.  We have plenty of biological examples on this planet, of life forms that stagnate (evolving only VERY slowly) as external pressures fall below the required threshold.  Online games like World Of Warcraft should show you that human beings can satisfy both their intellectual and emotional desires by simple repetitive visual / tactile stimulation. Intelligence does not seek to evolve, intelligence evolves only because our emotions demand satisfaction and the rational mind is the means to achieve it.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
Also, I'm not sure that the concept of "abundance" has an equal applicability to all things or to all human wants/needs. 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
If abundance is defined as "every emotional need is instantly satisfied" then what human want/need is lacking? What then is the motivator for progress?
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
For example, does it make sense to speak of "abundant air supply" as though this is equivalent to saying "abundant sexual stimulation"
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Of course not you would gladly for-go having sex if you were suffocating.  No they are not equivalent, they are related though, as the lack of both cause you pain and the having of both cause you pleasure (to a greater/lessor degree).
<br>
<br>
I do not think it will be quite as bleak as I am describing things.  It is likely the intelligences of the future will maintain a minimal amount of progress to insure society does not decline, robbing them of their bliss.  It is also likely a small minority of us will have the irrational need to continue on the journey of exploring the unknown, seeking a deeper understanding.  But I think these people will be viewed as a security risk by the majority.   It is also possible that by the time we get to this level of abundance we may have a pretty good idea of what is left to discover and that it might not be nearly interesting enough to keep any us from immersing ourselves deep into our Nirvana machines ;)
<br>
<br>
Again my main point here is to illustrate that our human nature does not suggest our evolution will accelerate at ever greater rates.  Evolution goes in stops and spurts, I think we are in for a large spurt, but a long stop will quickly follow.  </p></td>

Of course it will be disruptive.  Every single society in history, including America, has emerged in scarcity, its people striving to deal with scarcities in food and all other goods.

A true abundance--anything you want at anytime, grown in your own kitchen vat or garage vat--now that's something that has unimaginable consequences.  And as such, we can't "design" anything to deal with it.  Creative responses will emerge from the free decisions of billions of people.
