</blockquote>
<p>Most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> projects that I have been involved in personally are in the pattern-recognition field. The following is a description of some of these efforts from the point of view of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. This section is perhaps misnamed. This is not really a personal postscript; not recounted here are the many exceptional people who have made contributions to these projects, the early struggles of growing companies, the efforts to attract both capital and talent, the ambiguities and subtleties of understanding markets, the challenge of establishing manufacturing facilities, the relationships with vendors, suppliers, contractors, dealers, distributors, customers, consultants, attorneys, accountants, bankers, investment bankers, investors and the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, or the interpersonal challenges of building organizations.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">Optical Character Recognition</a></h1><p>I founded Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Products (KCP) in 1974. Our goal was to solve the problem of omnifont (any type font) <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a>) and to apply the resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to the reading needs of the blind as well as to other commercial applications. There had been attempts to help the blind read using conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s (those for a single or limited number of type fonts/, but these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s were unable to deal with the great majority of printed material as it actually exists in the world. It was clear that to be of much value to the blind, an <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> would have to read any style of print in common use and also deal with the vagaries of printing errors, poor quality photocopies, varieties of paper and ink, complex page formats, and so on. <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s had existed from the beginning of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> age, but all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s up to that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> had relied on <a class="thought" href="entries/template_matching_entry.html">template matching</a>, a form of low-level property extraction, and thus were severely limited in the range of material they could handle. Typically, users had to actually retype printed material using a specialized typeface before scanning. The principal value of these <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s was that typewriters were at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> more ubiquitous than <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> terminals.</p>
<p>It was clear to us that to produce an <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that was font invariant as well as relatively insensitive to distorted print, we would need additional experts beyond minimal property extraction. Our solution was to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/multiple_experts_entry.html">multiple experts</a>, including topological experts such as loop, concavity, and line-segment detectors, with an expert manager that could combine the results of both high- and low-level recognition experts. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> was able to <br>

<br> learn by having the high-level experts teach the low-level experts the type faces found in a particular document. At a later point we added <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> experts by providing the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> with a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of English (and ultimately several other <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s).</p>
<p>The first Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> (KRM/, introduced in 1976, consisted of an <a class="thought" href="entries/image_scanner_entry.html">image scanner</a> we developed ourselves that contained an electra-optical camera. The camera's eye consisted of a charge-coupled <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> containing 500 <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-sensitive <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s arranged in a straight line. The camera was mounted on an electromechanical "X-Y mover," which could move the camera in both vertical and horizontal directions. The material to be read (a book, magazine, typed letter, etc.) lay face down on the glass plate that formed the top of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. </p>
<p>The camera automatically moved back and forth scanning each line of print, transmitting the image <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally to a <a class="thought" href="entries/minicomputer_entry.html">minicomputer</a> contained in a separate cabinet. Using our omnifont <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/minicomputer_entry.html">minicomputer</a> recognized the characters, grouped them into words and computed the pronunciation of each word. To accomplish this last task, several hundred pronunciation rules were <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med in, along with several thousand exceptions. The resulting string of <a class="thought" href="entries/phoneme_entry.html">phoneme</a>s was sent to a speech <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>, which articulated each word. Subsequent models of the KRM have been substantially improved, but they are organized in a similar way.</p>
<p>Using the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> is straightforward: the user places the document to be read face down on the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, presses start, and listens. The KRM has a control panel to control the movement of the scanner, back it up, make it reread sections or spell out words, and provide a variety of other functions.<br>

</p>
<p>The KRM has been called the first commercial product to successfully incorporate <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. A recent survey showed that most blind college students have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a KRM to read their <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al materials. Nothing in my professional career has given me greater satisfaction than the many letters I have received from blind persons of all ages indicating the benefit they have received from the KRM in enabling them to complete their studies or gain and maintain productive employment.</p>
<p>Two years after the introduction of the KRM, we introduced a refined version, the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> Entry <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> (KDEM), designed for commercial applications. The KDEM, like the KRM, could scan printed and typed documents and recognize characters and page formats from a wide variety of sources, but rather than speaking the wards, it transmits them. It has been used to automatically enter documents into <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s, word-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>-publishing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and a variety of other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>For example, the KDEM was used to automatically scan and recognize all of the contributed articles in this book for entry into a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized publishing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Many <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s move <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> form onto the printed page. The KDEM allows it to move back not just as an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> image but in an intelligent form that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can understand and process further. </p>
<p>The result is to make the printed page another form of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage like a <a class="thought" href="entries/floppy_disk_entry.html">floppy disk</a> or tape. Unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, however, the printed page can be easily <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed by humans as well, which makes it the medium of choice for both people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>I find it interesting to review the rapidly improving price performance of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based products in terms of the products of my own companies. The 1978 KDEM were sold for $120,000, which, adjusted far <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>, is equivalent to $231,000 in 1990 dollars. It had 65,536 bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and recognized print at about 3 characters per second. In 1990 KCP offered a far superior product for under $5,000. </p>
<p>The 1990 version has 2 to 4 million bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, can recognize between 30 and 75 characters per second, can recognize a substantially wider range of degraded print, and is far more accurate than the 1978 KDEM. The 1990 version thus has 32 to 64 times as much <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, is 10 to 25 times faster, and is more accurate and versatile than the 1978 version. If we conservatively assume that it provides at least 15 times the performance at 1/46.2 the price, it represents an overall improvement in <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of 693 to 1. Since 2<sup>9.4</sup> = 693, KCP has doubled its <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> 9.4 times in 144 months, which is a doubling of <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> every 15.3 months. That rate is somewhat better than the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry at large, which is generally considered to double its <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> ratio only every 18 to 24 months.</p><h1>Speech Recognition</h1><p>On July 1, 1982, I founded Kurzweil Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>, (KAI). KAI's goal has been to master <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">automatic speech recognition</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and to integrate <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a> with other <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> technologies to solve real-world problems. The long-term goal is to establish <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a> as a ubiquitous modality of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. In 1985 we introduced the Kurzweil Voice <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a> (KVS), the first commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> with a 1,000 word vocabulary. A refined version called KVW, the first to provide a recognition vocabulary of up to 10,000 words, was introduced in 1987.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>The KAI speech recognizers follow the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> described in the previous section. The KVW, for example, has seven different experts, all of which attempt to recognize each spoken word simultaneously. Several of the experts analyze the <a class="thought" href="entries/acoustics_entry.html">acoustics</a> (or sound) of the word spoken, and the others are <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> experts <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med with a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of English word sequences (other <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s will follow in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>). The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> makes extensive use of user training and adaptation. It learns the phonological patterns (that is, the frequency patterns) and the phonetic sequences (the dialect) of each user. It also includes a user <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> expert that learns the characteristic word-sequence patterns used by each speaker.</p>
<p>The KVW consists of specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, an industry standard <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Before a user can begin productive dictation with the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, he needs to enroll, which involves speaking a sample of words to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to provide it with initial phonological and phonetic models. Once that has been accomplished, the user can dictate to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and watch each word appear on the screen within a fraction of a second after speaking it. The 1990 models require the user to provide a brief pause between words, although later models are expected to accept continuous speech.</p>
<p>The KVW actually improves its performance as the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> adapts to (that is, learns about) the user's pronunciation patterns and <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a>. This adaptation continues indefinitely. In addition to displaying each recognized word, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> also displays its second through sixth choices. If the KVW makes a mistake, one of these alternate words is very often the correct choice. Thus, errors are typically corrected by the user saying "Take two" or "Take three," which replaces the word originally displayed in the text with the appropriate alternate word.</p>
<p>KVW speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been integrated with a variety of applications. One version includes a full-function word-processor with the capability of entering text as well as issuing all editing and formatting commands by voice. Several sections of this book were written by voice using this version of the KVW. Other <br>

<br> versions of the KVW are integrated with <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that have expertise in the types of reports created in different professions. <br>

<br>
<span class="Caption">A doctor dictates medical reports to VoiceRad.</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>For example, VoiceRad integrates KAI's speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of radiology reporting, allowing a radiologist to quickly dictate the results of an examination for instantaneous transcription. As with the word-processor version of the KVW, the radiologist can dictate a report word by word. </p>
<p>In addition, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can automatically generate predefined sections of text based on its <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of radiology reporting. VoiceEM is a similar <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for emergency <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. A variety of similar <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s have been developed for <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> and other disciplines. This approach combines the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> gains of <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a>-based dictation with those of a built-in domain-specific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>. These products mark the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that a commercially available large vocabulary <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a> product has been used to create written text by voice in other than experimental situations.</p>
<p>KAI also has a major commitment to applying <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for the handicapped. Versions of KVS and KVW <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> provide means for text creation and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and environmental control for quadriplegic and other hand-impaired individuals. A long-term goal of the company is to develop a sensory aid for the deaf that would provide a real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> display of what someone is saying on the phone and in person.</p>
<p>The company's long-term objectives are two-fold. First, it intends to continue strengthening its core speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, to move toward the <a class="thought" href="entries/holy_grail_entry.html">Holy Grail</a> of combining large vocabulary <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a> with continuous-speech capability and minimal requirements for training the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for each user. Second, it intends to integrate <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">ASR</a> with a variety of applications, particularly those emphasizing other <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> technologies. Ultimately, our goal is to establish voice <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> as a desirable and widely used means of communicating with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> Revolution</h1><p>I founded <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_music_systems_entry.html">Kurzweil Music Systems</a> (KMS), also on July 1,1982. The inspiration for starting KMS came from two sources. One was my lifelong interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, along with a nearly lifelong interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. My father, a noted conductor and concert pianist, had told me shortly before his <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in 1970 that I would combine these two interests one day, although he was not sure how. The other and more immediate genesis of KMS was a conversation I had with <a class="thought" href="entries/wonder_entry.html">Stevie Wonder</a>, who had been a user of the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> from its inception. While showing me some new musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s he had recently acquired, Steve noted that two worlds of musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s--the acoustic and the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>--had developed with no bridge existing between them.</p>
<p>On the one hand, acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s such as the piano, violin, and guitar provided the musical sounds that were still the sounds of choice for most of the world's musicians. While these acoustic sounds were rich, complex, and musically satisfying, only limited means were available for controlling or even playing these sounds. </p>
<p>For one thing, once a piano key was struck, there was no further ability to shape the note other than to terminate it: the initial <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of the key strike was the only means for modifying piano sounds. Second, most <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s could only play one note at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>Third, there were no ways to <i>layer</i> sounds, that is, play the sounds of different <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s simultaneously. Even if you had the skills to play both a piano and a guitar, for example, you could hardly play both at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Even two musicians would find playing the same chords on a piano and guitar almost impassible. In any case, very few musicians, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how accomplished, could play more than a very few <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, as each one requires substantially different playing techniques. Since the playing methods themselves were linked to the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of each acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, many <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s required a high level of finger dexterity. If a composer had a multi-<a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al arrangement in mind, he had no way of even hearing what the piece sounded like without assembling a large group of musicians. Then making changes to the composition required laborious modification of written scores and additional rehearsal. I recall my father's lamenting the same difficulties.</p>
<p>Steve pointed out that on the other hand there existed the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> world of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> in which most of the above limitations are overcome. Using just one type of playing skill (e.g., a piano-keyboard technique), one can activate and control all available <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> sounds. A wide variety of techniques exist for modifying many aspects of the sounds themselves prior to as well as during performance (these techniques have expanded greatly since 1982). One can layer sounds by having each key initiate different sounds simultaneously. Using sequencers, one can play one part of a multi-<a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al composition, then play that part back from <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and play a second part over it, repeating this process indefinitely. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> suffered from a major drawback, namely the sounds themselves. While they had found an important role in both popular and classical <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, synthetic sounds were "thin," had relatively limited <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>, and did not include any of the desirable acoustic sounds.</p>
<p>Steve asked whether it would be possible to combine these two worlds of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> to create in a single <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> the capabilities of both. Such an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> could produce <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> that neither world of <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s alone could create.

<span class="Caption">A musician plays the Kurzweil 250 using the keyboard and an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> drum controller.</span>
<br>would, for example, enable musicians to play a guitar and a piano at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. We could take acoustic sounds and modify them to accomplish a wide variety of artistic purposes.</p>
<p>A musician could play a multi-<a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al composition (such as an entire orchestra) by himself using real acoustic (as well as <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>) sounds. A musician could play a violin or any other <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> <i>polyphonically</i> (playing more than one note at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>). One could play sounds of any <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> without having to learn the playing techniques of each. One could even create new sounds that were based on acoustic sounds, and thus shared their <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, but moved beyond them to a whole new class of timbres with substantial musical value.</p>
<p>This vision defined the goal of KMS. In June of 1983 we demonstrated an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering prototype of the Kurzweil 250 (K250j, and we introduced it commercially in 1984<sup>2</sup> The K250 was considered the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> to successfully emulate the sounds of a grand piano and a wide variety of other <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s: orchestral string <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s (violin, viola, etc.). guitar, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> voice, brass <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, drums, and many others. In listening tests we found that listeners, including professional musicians, were essentially unable to tell the K250 "grand piano" sound apart from that of a real $40,000 concert grand piano. A 12-track sequencer, sound layering, and extensive sound modification facilities provide a full complement of artistic control methods.</p>
<p>The essence of K250 <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> lies in its sound models. These <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> structures, contained in read-only <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> within the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, define the essential patterns of each <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> voice. We needed to create a signal-processing model of an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> that will respond to changes in pitch, loudness, and the passage of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in the same complex ways as the original acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>. </p>
<p>To create a sound model, the starting point is to record the original <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> using high-quality <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> techniques. Surprisingly, just finding the right <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s to record turned out to be a major challenge. We were unable, for example, to find a single concert grand piano with an attractive sound in all registers. Some had a beautiful bass region but a shrill midrange. Others were stunning in the high range, but mediocre otherwise. We ended up recording five different pianos, including the one that Rudolph Serkin plays when he comes to Boston.</p>
<p>When capturing an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, we record examples of many different pitches and loudness levels. When a particular key on a piano is struck with varying levels of force, it is not just the loudness level that changes but the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-varying spectrum of sound frequencies. All of these <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> recordings are fed into our sound analysis <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and a variety of both automatic and manual techniques are used to shape each <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> model. Part of the process involves a form of painstaking tuning and attention to detail ironically reminiscent of old-world craftsmanship. The automatic aspects of the process deal primarily with the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> compression. The original recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> for even a single <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> would exceed the K250's <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> capacity. Thus, it is necessary to include only the <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> necessary to accurately represent the original sounds.</p>
<p>When the keyboardist strikes the K250's piano-like keys, special sensors detect the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of each key's motion. (Other KMS keyboards can also detect the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-varying pressure exerted by each finger.) The K250's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s extract the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from the appropriate sound models in <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and then compute in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the waveforms representing the selected <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> sound, pitch, and loudness for each note. The varied control features, such as sequencing, layering, and sound modification, are provided by <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> routines stored in the unit's <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>.</p>
<p>In evolving our <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s at KMS, we have followed two paths. First, the K250 has evolved into a comprehensive <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for creating complex musical works. It is essentially a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> recording and production studio in an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, and it has become a standard for the creation of movie and television soundtracks and professional recordings. KMS has also moved to bring down the cost of its sound-modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Its K1000 series, for example, is a line of relatively inexpensive products that provide the same quality and <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of sounds as the K250.</p>
<p>There is an historic trend taking place in the musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> industry away from acoustic and mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and toward <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. There are two <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for this. First, the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is rapidly deteriorating because of the craftsmanship and labor-intensive <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of its manufacturing processes. A grand piano, for example, has over 10,000 mostly hand-crafted moving parts. The price of the average piano has increased by over 250 percent since 1970. At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it is widely acknowledged that the quality of new pianos is diminishing. On the other hand, the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s is, of course, rapidly improving. Furthermore, it is now possible for an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> to provide the same sound quality as an acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, with substantially greater functionality. For these <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> keyboard <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s have gone from 9.5 percent of the American market for keyboard <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s in 1980 to 55.2 percent in 1986 (according to the American <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> Conference). It is my strong belief that this trend will continue until the market is virtually entirely <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>. Our long-term goal at KMS is to continue to provide leadership for this emerging worldwide industry of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p><h1>A Final Note</h1><p>1 have tried to select projects that make it possible to build strong companies while meeting social and cultural goals that are important to me and others. I believe, for example, that there is a good match between the capabilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> and the needs of the handicapped. It has been a personal goal of mine to apply <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> technologies to help overcome the handicaps associated with major physical and sensory disabilities. I believe the potential exists in the next couple of decades to largely overcome these major handicaps. As amplifiers of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have great potential to assist <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, improve <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a>, and expand <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> for all of us, in all areas of work and play. I hope to play a role in constructively harnessing this potential.</p>
<p>All of the projects described above have been highly interdisciplinary efforts and have required the dedication and talents of many brilliant individuals in a broad range of fields. Inventing today is very much a team effort and its success is a function of the quality of the individual members of the team as well as the quality of the group's <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. As Norbert Wiener pointed out in <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>, scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers with different areas of expertise often use entirely different technical vocabularies to refer to the same phenomena. </p>
<p>Creating an environment in which a team of linguists, speech scientists, signal-processing experts, <a class="thought" href="entries/vlsi_entry.html">VLSI</a> designers, and other specializts can understand each other's terminology and effectively work together (as was required, for example, in the efforts to develop the speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> described above) is at least as challenging as the development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> itself. Once developed, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> (and the technologists) must be further integrated into the equally well-developed disciplines of manufacturing, marketing, finance, and the other management skills of a modern corporation.</p>
<p>It is always exciting to see (or hear) a new product, to experience the realization of a vision after years of hard collaborative work. Perhaps my greatest pleasure has been the opportunity to share in the creative process with the many outstanding men and women who have contributed to these endeavors.</p><h1>Notes</h1><a name="r1"></a>

Fantastic challenge to break a huge task into it's isometric building block and GO FOR IT!

I try and still train at group leading. i chose very hard characters because they were bloody minded enough to think for themselves and catharting the personality halts is as fun as solving the technical problems.  It's a matter of who can do what rather than job designations.
<br>
<br>
It must be different when money involved (I try to get people to work for free, which usually means everyone but the graphics department!)
<br>
<br>
Also I always felt that everyone knew tons more than me but I happened to be able to get the project incepted.
<br>
<br>
As you go on though, those people integrate and it moves forward by itself, and you have really great friends who have gone through everything together.
<br>
<br>
Fascinating group dynamics.
<br>
<br>
It's much better paying people and possibly easier, but that assumes you have a commercial market instead of running a skunk.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've got to relearn about money, what it's use is and why it's helpful to include it in the factors of production.
<br>
<br>
I've non-plussed many investor approaches who probably didn't understand my weird attitude to it.
<br>
<br>
I'm interested how Ray moved from MIT research to production with venture capital.
<br>
<br>
we run a s a club because we can forage in skips and throw out fro some neat machine systems and use a pool of enthusiasts  to hunt for SAI: if it pays off it pays of mega.
<br>
<br>
In either case it's definitely a journey and Ray Kuzweil is a superstar to us in London.
