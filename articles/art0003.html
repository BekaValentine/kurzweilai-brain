            <h1>1994</h1>
            <p>March 30: Today I turn forty. I am officially protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. If I had an employer, I could now sue him if he discriminated against me because of my, ulp, age. Until now, I've half believed in
              one of Vladimir Nabokov's elegant syllogisms: Other men die, but I am not other men; therefore, I'll not die. Nabokov died in 1977. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I look in the bathroom
              mirror, I see <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a>, the Eternal Footman (looking quite proud), standing in the shadows behind me, holding my coat, snickering. I live with my family in my hometown of
              Omaha. My selfish genes have managed an <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> of sorts by getting themselves into four delightful children, who are still too young to turn on me. My wife and
              I have enjoyed nine years of marriage, what Robert Louis Stevenson called "a friendship recognized by the police." I'm Catholic, so as <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> looms on the far side
              of the middle-age horizon, I seek consolation in my Christian faith and one of its central tenets: belief in the <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> of my <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>.
              But the lawyer in me also highlights the usual caveats and provisos. According to the Scriptures, my quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> after <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>
              may depend on my ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> my fellow man. This is a big problem. I forgot to mention that in addition to being a practicing Catholic, I'm also a practicing
              misanthrope. As I see it, my only chance of avoiding eternal damnation is to stay alive until I learn to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> other people. Or until some <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>
              pope issues an encyclical providing <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual guidance for misanthropic Catholics. November 16: My second <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>,
              White Man's Grave, is a finalist for the National Book Award. For at least a day or two, I wonder if I might be able to achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> by writing great
              literature. My wife and I fly to the awards ceremony in New York City, where William Gaddis wins the National Book Award in Fiction for A Frolic of His Own.</p>
            <p>We return to Omaha, where, instead of reading the Scriptures or A Frolic of His Own, I read Woody Allen, who said, "I don't want to achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> through my
              work. I want to achieve it through not dying."</p>
            <h1>1997</h1>
            <p>February 23: I am in the Sheep's Head Tavern in east London, banging my flagon, bending my elbow, when the evening news comes on the telly over the bar and I learn that Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in Scotland has cloned a sheep
              named Dolly. I am not personally acquainted with or fond of any sheep that I would like to see multiplied like loaves and fishes. Most of what I know about sheep I learned in crowded taverns like this one, banging my flagon, bending my
              elbow, and listening to off-color bestiality jokes. I fail to appreciate the significance of Dolly for my own personal <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. Flagon. Elbow.</p>
            <p>March 30: Birthdays seem to be coming every other month or so. I'm now forty-three years old. Still in Omaha; still a novelist. At my back, I hear the AARP's silver-chariot specials drawing near.</p>
            <p>August 4: My wife and I reform our diets and take up a fitness regimen to shed pounds and replenish our dwindling reserves of vim and vigor.</p>
            <p>We hire a sitter for the kids, then jog for almost an hour, and we eat nothing but kale and soybeans for dinner. We are starving and sore, stretched out in bed and watching the news, when we learn that the world's oldest living
              person, Jeanne Louise Calment of Arles, France, died today at 122 years of age. Jeanne reportedly soaked her food in olive oil at every meal and also rubbed olive oil on her skin every day; she loved <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a>
              wine and ate two pounds of chocolate per week; she smoked cigarettes until she was 120 years old. August 5: We have quit jogging. The cupboards of our modest Omaha home are lined with bottles of Bertolli extra-virgin olive oil, and UPS
              brings Godiva chocolates twice a week. My wife and I begin to experiment with tobacco products.</p>
            <h1>1998</h1>
            <p>May: The entire country waits for <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> testing to be performed on the megalosperm of its spermoblastic alpha-<a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a>
              commander in chief. Believe me, I am no closer to loving my fellow man. Meanwhile, other cellular developments continue apace, some of which may allow me to prolong my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>
              until people start becoming lovable again. On top of everything else, I'm now a screenwriter, not a novelist--so artistic <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> is completely out of the
              question.</p>
            <p>July: Dolly the sheep goes out like a lamb, and in come twenty-two cloned mice--seven of which are cloned from a single <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>--created by Ryuzo Yanagimachi at the
              University of Hawaii. The news includes experts' speculations about the practical uses of cloning <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. For instance, what if I could create anencephalic
              (brainless) clones of myself and put them in cold storage? Then I could harvest fresh hearts and livers to replace the ones damaged by smoking, eating chocolates, and consuming <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a>
              wine. Too ghoulish for my tastes; instead, I resolve to look after my <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>, even if it means <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> my fellow man.</p>
            <p>August 23: I'm not the only one with <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. I head to the local bookstore
              looking for Milan Kundera's <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a>, which is about people like me, who are anxious about
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>.</p>
            <p>The store doesn't carry Kundera, but it does have a new book called <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a>: How <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Is
              Extending Your <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> Span--and Changing the World. Maybe I don't have to worry about my immortal <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>,
              because on the first page of his book, one Ben Bova tells me just what I want to hear: "The first immortal <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are probably living among us today. You might be
              one of them." Bova falls well short of Kundera as a stylist, but his book does explain how my cells age and ultimately die and how it soon may be possible to arrest or even reverse this process.</p>
            <p>Biologists at the Geron Corporation have already altered <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells in a petri dish and enabled them to defeat the genetic process of aging by exceeding what is called
              the Hayflick limit. In 1961, biologist Leonard Hayflick discovered that normal <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells divide about fifty times during a normal <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
              lifetime. It seems that each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> my cells divide, the <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s and their <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>
              must be duplicated, but each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> this happens, the ends of the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> (called <a class="thought" href="entries/telomere_entry.html">telomere</a>s)
              are slightly depleted, until gradually they become so short that my cells can no longer make accurate, functional copies of themselves, whereupon I will age and ultimately--well, that thing that Nabokov said happens to other men will
              happen to me. Telomerase is an enzyme that arrests or reverses this shortening process, meaning it may enable my cells to reproduce "young" copies of themselves forever.</p>
            <p>How long before telomerase injections are available to arrest aging in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings? My health-insurance provider assists me promptly anytime I need help paying my
              premiums, but I get placed on hold whenever I call to obtain services or file a claim or ask a question about telomerase.</p>
            <p>November: <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers funded by Geron take <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
              <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s and grow them into <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, muscle cells, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
              tissues. Meanwhile, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers from Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>
              take a <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> from an adult <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>
              and put it into a cow's denucleated egg <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, converting the ensemble into an <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>nic <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. Contrary to reports I read in the popular press, the cow-egg experiment is not designed to produce Minotaurs or
              Homo bovinus. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers used the denucleated cow egg only because of the ban on using the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
              equivalent for such <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. Rather, the experiment dramatizes the possibility of taking the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>
              from one of my adult <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells and converting it back into a "pluripotent" <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>, which can be
              tweaked or "steered" into forming any kind of cells: blood, bone, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, heart, kidney, or liver. Because the resulting tissue or organ comes from my own <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem
                cell</a>s, all of the rejection complications of organ transplantation vanish.</p>
            <p>November 19: Author Richard Powers observes in a New York Times op-ed, "What we can do should never by itself determine what we choose to do, yet this is the way technolo-gy tends to work." I agree with Richard Powers. But that's
              probably because I'm not sick yet, nor am I in need of an organ replacement. Yet.</p>
            <p>December 17: It happened. The big one. In the wee hours of an Omaha dawn, I peer at my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> monitor at The New York Times on the Web, where it is reported that at
              Kyunghee University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have allegedly combined an egg and a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>
              from a single donor to produce the first stages of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> cloned from a single <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
              being. This news gives me serious pause, but it's me I want to live forever, not a <a class="thought" href="entries/clone_entry.html">clone</a> of me, so I'm more
              attracted to the idea of having all the spare parts I need. As miracles of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> are reported every other week, no one else seems to notice, because we
              are now a nation of 270 million obsessive-compulsives in the grip of twin autochthonous ideas: <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> and perjury.</p>
            <h1>1999</h1>
            <p>March 30: For my birthday (number forty-five), my wife gives me a book, The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, by Ray Kurzweil, which convinces me that,
              along with <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> of my personal <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>
              may also include <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips. Kurzweil spins out the implications of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>: In 1965, <a class="thought"
                href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, an inventor of the <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> and now chairman emeritus of Intel,
              observed that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips seemed to evolve in two-year cycles; every two years, <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> makers were
              able to fit twice as many <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>. "Since the cost of an
              <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> is fairly constant," he said, "the implication is that every two years you can get twice as much <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry
              running at twice the speed for the same price. For many applications, that's an effective quadrupling of value. The observation holds true for every type of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>,
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> chips to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> processors." What does <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's
                Law</a> have to do with my <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>? First, consider this: In 1850, the average American <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>
              span was 38 years. Here in 1999, 150 years later, it's 76 years. Would it be fair to assume that in the next 150 years the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>
              span will at least double to 150 years, enabling some of us to live until <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> is able to confer <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>
              on us?</p>
            <p>More (Moore?) to the point, most artificial-<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> experts predict that tissue, especially <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>
              tissue, will merge in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural

            <p>March 30: I'm fifty-five years old. I don't write screenplays anymore. I'm a <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> provider for 3-D multimedia games. I <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>

              encouraging, except that his <a class="thought" href="entries/wetware_entry.html">wetware</a> has degraded. He has three, maybe four anecdotes that play over and over again like <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>
              audio clips: the one about the snowstorm of '74, the one about his ship sinking at Pearl Harbor, the one about how his grandmother knew Abe Lincoln. I want to assign them variables. Let 1 = the snowstorm story, let 2 = the Pearl Harbor
              story, et cetera. Then our conversations could become more efficient. He could just say, "One," and I would understand him perfectly.</p>
            <p>May 1: The May issue of BioScience has a huge spread about how telomerase works in mice and monkeys. I've signed up for the upcoming <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> trials of experimental
              telomerase therapy, but the FDA is dragging its feet on approving the treatment for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. Furthermore, it seems that even if telomerase works in people, it will
              probably simply arrest my aging process, not reverse it.</p>

            <p>May 14: The FDA has approved my application to receive experimental telomerase therapy. As such, I am a member of a small group of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> subjects carefully selected
              according to strict medical criteria, meaning each of us has a net worth in excess of eight figures and the ability to pay cash up front without whining about it.</p>

              and implanted them back into their hosts without complications. The FDA is waiting for <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from several <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>

              built into these new <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. They are <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to defer to their owners' wishes without argument

              still refusing to pay for telomerase therapy because it's "experimental." My wife has also begun receiving expensive telomerase therapy, which we pay for out of our retirement funds. From now on, I will have two ages: an absolute age,
              measured from my date of birth in 1954, and a relative age, measured by analyzing my cellular senescence and determining the age at which my cells were prevented from aging further by telomerase therapy. I will be sixty-five years old
              for the foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
            <h1>2029</h1>
            <p>November 16: My SE (simulated experience) titled "Climbing Mount Everest" is a finalist for the National Total Touch Award. My wife and I travel to the awards ceremony in New York City, where Dick Boeotian wins the 2029 Total Touch
              Award for his simulation "Rape of the Sabine Women," based upon the painting of the same name by Nicolas Poussin.</p>
            <p>At dinner parties and other social events, my wife and I constantly wonder who is receiving telomerase therapy and who isn't. There is still a certain cachet attached to those who manage to look young without the help of an enzyme.
              But according to New York Times Today, 55 percent of the population is receiving telo-merase, which is still a prescription <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> but is easy to obtain if you're
              more than forty years of age.</p>
            <p>My NCI (noncarbon-based <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>--what we used to call a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) insists I don't look a
              day over fifty, but such flattery is frequently followed by a request, most recently for some of the new 10,000-megahertz <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">RAM</a> cards. My wife says I spoil the thing. I admit
              I've grown extremely fond of it. I wonder: What are the chances I might score afterlife points for loving noncarbon-based <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-forms?</p>
            <p>December 18: I complain to my doctor about the age spots on the backs of my hands. They've been there since before I was telomerase-arrested. Am I going to have them forever? He explains that <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers
              are working furiously to come up with a compound that will not only arrest but reverse the aging process. The problem is that different organ <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>
              types have different Hayflick limits, which must be synchronized if they are to be reversed. Otherwise, you could conceivably wind up with, say, presidential intellect and the
              limbicsystemand <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> drive of a nineteen-year-old. Then what?</p>
            <p>December 21: My oldest son is now forty-three years old. He qualifies to receive telomerase therapy but has refused to sign up. Every Sunday afternoon, he and my oldest daughter (forty-one years old) treat me to bulletins about how
              immoral my wife and I are for choosing to live beyond our allotted <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in the so-called natural world.</p>
            <p>My son and daughter and other working people in their generation are complaining about the taxes they pay to provide entitlements to us, the elderly and telomerase-arrested. Fortunately, the young are still a political minority, but
              lately commentators have started interviewing disgruntled <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> officers who are openly warning of a rebellion.</p>
            <p>December 28: I go in for a neuro-upgrade package. I receive audiovisual implants, including high-resolution <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>l displays, so I no longer need an external
              monitor--images are displayed directly on my <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>. I also receive <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s implants,
              including <a class="thought" href="entries/direct_neural_path_entry.html">direct neural pathway</a>s with infrared and <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>ic ports for high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>

            <h1>2054</h1>
            <p>March 30: For my hundredth birthday (absolute age), I receive a package bomb from a neo-Luddite terrorist group called the Sons of Ted K. Fortunately, my forearm-mounted unit (<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed
              to the main Total Home Management <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">SYSTEM</a>) detected the explosives before I opened the package. After the bomb squad dismantles the thing, I read the letter, which says:
              "Die! We are sick and tired of paying taxes to keep you alive!"</p>
            <p>Eighty percent of the population is over seventy years old. The <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> steadfastly maintains that Social Security is solvent, but my son points out that he is
              taxed at the rate of 75 percent to support medical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, telomerase therapies, organ transplants, and implant upgrades for telomerase-arrested seniors. June 12:
              Congress passes the Omni-bus Reproduction Act of 2054, which makes the unlicensed reproduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based units of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>
              punishable by two hundred years of enforced sterility. Rumors surface in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> channels that biotech <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers
              have discovered synthetic telomerase derivatives that not only halt cellular senescence but also reverse the effects of aging: the fountain of youth. Sources say that the Bureau of Population is asking Congress to ban the <a class="thought"
                href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> because of the effects it will have on dwindling <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary resources.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, all of my golfing buddies and I are trying to find out where we can get some.</p>
            <p>September 12: Today, my wife and I receive the tragic news that our oldest son has joined a neo-Luddite terrorist group called Darwin's Army. He is now hiding out somewhere with other zealot militiamen in Montana and has devoted his
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to natural <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and waging war against <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.
              October 15: My wife and I have razor wire and <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> detectors installed around the perimeters of our Omaha home. Darwin's Army is now paying handsome bounties for the
              corpses of senior citizens (defined as anyone telomerase-arrested after age fifty), because old people are generally perceived as consuming more than they produce.</p>
            <h1>2069</h1>
            <p>February 2: The unthinkable has happened. A dear friend of ours, Marvin Furbelow, was captured and destroyed by a terrorist group calling itself the Lud Brigade. His body was carefully mutilated to ensure total unit failure. Because
              most of our friends are telomerase-arrested and have easy <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the newest transplant technologies, we haven't lost someone we knew personally for almost forty
              years. Marvin's TUF is an incomprehensible tragedy, and for weeks we cower inside our home.</p>
            <p>June 8: My wife and I get into a big argument about whether I really need a new $75 million model 2050 liver transplant or whether I should settle for a model 2040, which costs only $39 million. I argue that I can pay the difference
              out of my own pocket, because I've been hired by the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">Sense</a>-U-Surround producers to create a total-touch experience about what it's like to get a new liver grown from my
              own <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s and about the angst and intimations of what used to be called <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> that it
              inspires in transplant recipients.</p>
            <p>July 23: I went for the model 2050, and the operation was an unqualified success. More than thirty-five million of the world's ten billion people have had livers grown from their own <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem
                cell</a>s and implanted during the last year, so my new total-touch experience, "A Centenarian Gets a New Liver," is a huge success.</p>
            <p>September 19: As luck would have it, Oprah was telomerase-arrested the year after I was, and she too has had a liver grown from her own <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s and implanted.
              While she's recuperating, somebody gives her a copy of "A Centenarian Gets a New Liver." Two weeks later, she's on the air showing the audience how her scars have disappeared and touting "Centenarian" because it makes people stop and
              think about what it means to get a $75 million liver transplant after a century of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Doesn't it just make you wonder?</p>
            <h1>2079</h1>
            <p>February 3: I receive a letter, rather, a communique, from my son, who is dying, simply because he will not accept telomerase or organ transplants. I didn't raise him to be mortal, but he just won't listen to me. Instead, he wants me
              to stop taking telo-merase and rejoin the "natural <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race." My daughter and my son are both "older," relatively speaking, than my wife and I, and they have all the
              crotchets and personality disorders that come with natural aging. What pains in the ass!</p>
            <p>My daughter travels around the country giving speeches to activists and neo-Luddite groups who forswear telomerase and artificial-implant technologies and boycott all artworks created with the aid of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial
                intelligence</a>. Her political party, Natural Way, espouses the belief that <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> is the true <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>

              Darwin's Army and the Sons of Ted K. now have members in the House of Representatives, and several senators, when pressed, confess they used to belong to these organizations, but only to fight for the nutritional rights of the
              oppressed. Youth rallies are all over the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> channels. Young people claim to have heightened awareness and ecstatic visions inspired by the natural condition of <a class="thought"

            <p>November 13: I go in for more liver scans and tests. It seems there's another hepatic-malfunction problem. "Already?" I scream. "Can't a guy get decent livers anymore?" When the specializts huddle around me wearing 3-D headsets and do
              a walk-through tour of my liver at the cellular level, I hear stray remarks about <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a>-wine damage, but I suspect these doctors simply want to sell me a new liver.
              Finally, my hepatogastroenterologist gets straight to the point: "How much <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a> wine do you drink?" Maybe I could fudge a little? Probably not, because I know the next
              question out of his mouth will be, "How many liver transplants have you had?"</p>

                  <p>One of the assumptions in the 'Diary of an Immortal Man' is that organ transplants will become increasingly expensive. The opposite is more likely to be true.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It may be stretching things a bit, but one could imagine one's own cloning machine and personal robot with downloaded instructions on performing clonal organ replacements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If an organ needed to be replaced, the robot would capture the necessary stem cells from a blood sample, grow the appropriate organ in the cloning machine, and perform the operation in a sterilized bathroom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To make it really cheap, the machine and the robot could be rented for the time of the procedure.

                  <p>And eventually nanobots will do it on the fly internally as a regular and ongoing maintenance program. They could even build and then connect a new organ inside you while you're walking around. Then simply disolve the old organ
                    when they're finished.

                  <p>Another couple of assumptions in the story are that the whole of human civilization will remain on earth, and that we will have advanced medical nanotech without manufacturing nanotech. With AI only a fraction of powerful as
                    that described and a nanotech advanced enough to grow digestible food, it should be no big deal to construct robot spacecraft and use them to set up space based resource mining and send stuff back. Or begin moving immortals off
                    earth, or uploading them into substrate that really only consumes electricity or any of a number of other scenarios that would minimize if not eliminate the effects of an immortal population on the environment while creating a

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    According to a press release (10 December 2001), two University of Colorado at Boulder researchers working with GenoPlex Inc. in Denver have identified a biological switch that controls lifespan in tiny worms, a finding that
                    could have applications for mammals, including people.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The switch, known as DAF-16, is a protein that can either lengthen or shorten the lifespan in the eyelash-sized roundworm, C. elegans, said CU-Boulder psychology Professor Thomas Johnson.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Johnson, who is a fellow in the university's Institute for Behavioral Genetics, or IBG, said DAF-16 is a critical part of a complex signaling pathway that involves insulin and glucose. Henderson has identified a molecule that
                    embodies a trade off, said Johnson. "If DAF-16 is 'on,' it triggers less reproduction, more efficient cell repair and longer lives. On the other hand, if DAF-16 is 'off,' the result is more reproduction, worse cell repair and a
                    shortened lifespan," he said.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is a good possibility scientists could develop a pharmaceutical intervention that would trigger translocation of DAF-16 into the cell nucleus of a variety of animals, including humans, said Henderson. This would cause
                    organisms to lower their reproduction level and fight off the negative impacts of free radicals.

                  <p>I guess my thought is "Does anybody *REALLY* want to be immortal?" Somehow it just isn't that appealing to be around to watch all the many atrocities that occur over a several lifetimes. One lifetime is enough. And would we not
                    just create another class based society? The immortals versus the mortals. Just some thoughts.</p>

                    <br>
                    I'm amused at the idea that we shouldn't do something just because of what happens to fictional characters in arbitrarily constructed stories, as opposed to what happens to real people in real situations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After all, with the stroke of a pen, the fictional story can turn out differently. Or the story could be interpreted in ways at odds with the author's explicit intentions. For example, Satan in "Paradise Lost" has been viewed by
                    literary critics as the HERO of the epic poem, probably against Milton's explicit intentions. (Considering the role of Satan in the Christian worldview, that's quite a public-relations makeover!) And Bram Stoker's Dracula has
                    been re-imagined as a sexy, heroic and romantic figure by contemporary culture, again contra the author's intentions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Perhaps it's time for Victor Frankenstein to be re-interpreted in a positive way as well, so that comparing a Transhumanist to Frankenstein will be considered complimentary, as in calling him "heroic, visionary, daring, sexually
                    desirable."</p>

                  <p>Gulliver was a satire on real events taking place in England at the time the story was written. The characters in the story represent real people and political parties and what they were acting like in the eyes of the author.

                  <p>Haven't you heard the saying, "There are worse things than death?" Slavery and bondage have been considered worse by some. Some people feel that having to live with all the terrible things they have done is a punishment worse
                    than death. How would immortality affect that equation? How about living on a crowded planet with lousy infrastructure and poor planning by corrupt politicians? Or just being locked in your little cubicle and bored out of your
                    skull for the next thousand years because the virtual world available to you is much like the TV you have available today? Live long and prosper, Mr. Spock.</p>

                    You say Happiness is something we sustain everyday. I was happy today playing with my puppies, but that happiness disappeared very quicky as I realized I was out of food for them and had to go out to the store. Living forever
                    always chasing this happiness doesn't appeal. If there were a joyfulness that was deeper, something that wasn't quite so fleeting, I might go for immortality.</p>

                    What I was saying is that our bodies are going to have to be made of something other than flesh and bone in order to stand up to events like the collapse of the World Trade Center. Even steel girders weren't able to survive that.
                    One solution, though, is if we were enshrined as data and information in various storage facilities scattered around the universe. That might survive the destruction of stars and galaxies, but not the end of the universe itself.</p>

                  <p>grantc4: I know you may not be suggesting living as data and information, but honestly, one must now consider what is life? But if this is the case hasn't Shakespeare, Socrates, Aristole, and other such men obtained immortality.
                    Their thoughts, ideas and such have lived beyond their bodies for 1,000 plus years for some of the Greek Philosphers. But are they really alive? It seems in this discussion of immortality, we must first define life. Then we can

                  <p>&gt;you make the assumption that a person is merely dna and that one can be reconstructed from bits of data sitting on a hard disk somewhere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Every cell in your body is a hard disk containing the necessary code to create a clone of you. It's being done every day with sheep, mice, cows and other animals. The only thing that keeps us from doing it with people is that we
                    are just learning how to do it and the people who are doing it don't want to make a mistake in the process. About 10% of the animals cloned in this way make it to term and produce a viable copy. That's better than when they
                    started, but they still have a long way to go. Although it's too early to try this on people, there are researchers making plans to do it right now.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But that's just a body. What we call a "soul" is created through the body's interaction with it's environment. What you go through in your childhood and the things you learn from family, friends and associates in the process
                    forge a soul in the crucible of experience. The elements of potential enshrined in your DNA code and the realization of that potential as you live your life make up you, me, and everyone else.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since a clone would not share the same experience that you have had, it would have to be encoded and stored until SOME FUTURE DATE when it could be recovered. The final product would not be a duplicate of you, but you plus
                    whatever new experiences shaped the life of the clone and how that clone reacted to them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How do we store these experiences? They are the signals that are created when light strikes the cones in the back of the eye and are processed by the brain. In addition, they are mixed with the signals created by sound waves
                    striking your ear drums, the signals that come from your nose and mouth when you taste or smell, and the signals sent from the tips of your fingers and toes, all of your skin, and the other organs of your body.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we have within us detectors to read these signals as they pass through us on the way to the brain and a place to store them in the form of ROM, a man's life could be pretty well reconstructed and transmitted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    DNA is, after all, a sequence of only four chemicals (Adenine, Thiamin, Cytosine, and Guanine). Cloning is done by taking this sequence from the body of one animal and inserting it into the egg of another animal of the same
                    species. The clone thus created has most of the qualities and appearance of the animal from which the DNA code was taken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The human body produces clones in the normal course of reproduction when a woman's body gives birth to identical twins. One egg divided into two and the DNA code created two copies of the same basic person.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    John J. Ratey, M.D. in his book, A USER'S GUIDE TO THE BRAIN: Perception, Attention, and the Four Theaters of the Brain, says the following:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Most of our traits are caused by the interaction of many genes as influenced by the environment."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Studies of identical twins separated at birth are often used to test the debate between nature and nurture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "The remarkable twinning effect directly contradicts the notion that environment is more important than genes. In these cases, twins who are raised apart (with no contact) and are reunited years later find their lives are very
                    similar. This was the case for a pair of twin brothers separated five weeks after birth and raised eighty miles apart in Ohio. When Jim Lewis and Jim Springer were reunited at the age of thirty-nine, they found they had both
                    married women named Linda, divorced, and remarried women named Betty. Both chain-smoked Salem cigarettes, drank Miller Lite, loved stock-car racing, hated baseball and vacationed on the same stretch of beach in Florida. Studies
                    of 7,000 sets of twins by the Minnesota Center for Twin and Adoption Research show that a number of traits may be driven by genes, including alienation, leadership, vulnerability to stress, and even religious conviction and
                    career choice."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So it would seem that identical twins (clones) share nearly identical souls, and DNA is the determining factor. if we could transmit this sequence and use chemicals available at the end point to reproduce it, we should be able to
                    create a clone of the person whose data we transmitted. If we recorded that person's life in the form of the electrical signals that comprised his/her experience, we could provide the cloned body with the original's reactions to
                    that experience. So, basically, you would end up with the same basic (but not exact) person.

                  <p>i guess my point was is the clone of you, actually you or another person that thinks and acts like you?? cloning animals is useful to the extent that we can create physical copies of a animal, but beyond observing behavioral
                    similarities, we lack the ability to communicate with the cloned animal and hence cannot verify that the clone is completely the same mentally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    your hypothesis that the soul is the sum of ones interaction with their surrounding environment/experiences is just that, a hypothesis. does a person that spends their entire life in a featureless room with no external stimuli
                    not have a soul??

                    <br>
                    that said, your theory that a person can be brought to life from their dna is an interesting one, and if it can be demonstrated as correct, then it could possibly show that humans are simply self-aware robots rather than a
                    creation of some omnipotent being.

                    to me, your post referred to the possibility of becoming immortal (meaning exempt from death in websters) by creating clones of one's original self when they die. please correct me if i misread you at all, but i have some issues
                    with that idea.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    let me put it like this. i can go to a website and download a picture of the mona lisa, print it out and frame it and destroy the original. what i end up with is not the mona lisa, but a copy of. i have not prolonged the life of
                    the mona lisa, instead i have just ensured that a picture that looks like it still exists after it has been destroyed. no matter how you look at it, a facsimilie can not be counted as the original
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    attempting to achieve immortality in this way is not the prolonging of one's life, rather it's about ensuring that there always exists a human being that is exactly like you...which i find a little bizarre.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    the same goes for using this method for teleportation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    nim
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    also i think your point that identical twins are clones further invalidates your theory. if one twin dies, then they cannot be said to still alive simply because there still exists a person that shares the same physical and
                    behavioural traits.</p>

                  <p>I think I said what you pointed out in my previous post. But the big difference between the mere clone and the upload is that what is transmitted is not only the identical body and mind but the stored impressions of that body
                    and mind. This is not the case with twins, who live separate lives, even though they live in the same house. Also, among identical twins living in the same hourse, researchers find they deliberately try to differentiate
                    themselves. These same Researchers found identical twins to be more alike when separated than when raised together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But if I take my genetic code and use it to build an identical body and take all the information that came into my original body as captured by nanobots monitoring the electronic signals that transfer the information from my
                    sense organs to my brain, then I can produce something very close to the me that now walks the earth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But no matter how good the copy it will still not be me. If you could talk to the body of Socrates and that body had been exposed to the same input about the world as the original Socrates, wouldn't the result be close enough
                    that you wouldn't notice the difference? Sure, technically, there would now be two Socrates. But they would be closer in body and thought than identical twins.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you had a copy of the Mona Lisa that an expert couldn't distinguish from the original, wouldn't that be good enough? It would decrease the value of the original in the sense that there would now be two indistinguishable Mona
                    Lisas, but that has more to do with the way humans assign value to objects than it does with the objects themselves. And from the day of the creation of the new Mona Lisa, they would exist in different circumstances that would
                    tend to distinguish them from each other from that point on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And it's also true that my original body would someday die, which would mean it was not immortal in the sense we use the term now. But if the copy of me was able to continue my experience of life by adding on to what I had
                    already perceived, thought, and done, how different would that be from the immortality you are talking about? The body like mine would have my past experience and it's future experience to encode and pass on to the next copy, ad
                    infinitim. The body would not be immortal, but the life it lived would achieve something very close to that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The differentiation between a body and a machine is a tenuous one when we can create and change bodies just like we do with machines. We design our machines to work like our bodies to the extent that we can. They use the same
                    principles of phytsics that our bodies do. My body is full of tubes and pumps and clocks and ball joints. My blood circulates using the same principle the water company uses to keep the water flowing into my house and to take the
                    used and dirty water out of it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we start adding new parts to that body in the form of machines, we will have something that is neither man nor machine, but a bit of both. I see us augmented by internal computers that help us store and analyze our
                    impressions of the world around us at teraflop speed. I see us being able to grow new parts when old ones wear out and to be in touch with the rest of humanity without needing external machines like phones or modems. And all we
                    feel, think and do will be stored some place where it can be passed on to the next body we clone to take the place of the one that gets too damaged to continue. Our immortality will be in our lives rather than our bodies.</p>

                  <p>in a discussion on becoming immortal, ie. exempt from death, where does creating endless copies of ones self fit in? this sounds more like a solution for creating huxely's version of a brave new world rather then extending one's

                    a soul is defined as the essence of life not, as you put it, the body's interaction with it's environment. your definition sounds more like memory than anything else.

                  <p>The essence of life is information as (a) encoded in our DNA and (b) encoded in our language and culture. Therefore, the accumulation of information seems most likely to constitute the soul. What other form do you think this
                    essence of life and soul can take?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Do you have evidence of something solid we can put our fingers on? Or does solid evidence preclude all else from consideration and leave us only with the spiritual to wrestle with? Defining "the essence of life" reminds me of the
                    old programmers description of programming as "trying to nail jello to a tree."

                    As the Chinese say, "A person can lose his way trying to describe the Tao." Or as Laotze put it, "The Tao you can describe is not the Tao." When our words become so abstract they no longer refer to anything we can point to, they
                    in essence lose all meaning. ;-)&gt;</p>

                    the validity of your method for immortality all comes down to that which defines a "living human being" and the human soul.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    having read your posts, it is clear to me that we are in two very distinct camps with regards to the former, and as such i find it hard to believe that we will ever be in agreement (at least until your method can be physically
                    demonstrated). this makes arguing futile as neither side will concede, essentially making the dispute a waste of time pending further scientific discoveries.

                    <br>
                    that said, it has been an interesting and thought invoking argument, for with i want to thank you.

                  <p>I agree and I thank you for raising questions that forced me to pursue lines of thought I might not otherwise have looked into.

                    Each person interprets the world in the light of his or her own convictions and, once developed, these are not lightly changed. But none of us can understand the whole universe, so each of us has to work with what he thinks he
                    has learned. Since we've been talking about a future that doesn't exist yet, there can't be any right or wrong in either of our views.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our arguement boils down to how we define the words we use and what they refer to. That's a personal viewpoint for each of us, built on a lifetime of experience and the practice of putting it into words. That's too much history
                    to change with a single arguement. But thanks again for taking me through it.

                  <p>In my mind, the argument of whether or not this "soul" exists is pointless. If this soul isn't something physical that can be physically transmitted or transported, then essientially it doesn't exist. The very idea of the soul,
                    where does it come from? I wouldn't think that it came from any physical evidence, so again, it's essentially just an idea that can't be proven/disproven, so any argument about it or about the conseqences thereof, I think, would
                    be irrelevent to the discussion. Why consider that which has no effect, right?</p>

                    Maybe (and I do not necessarily believe in a soul) the soul is something we do not yet understand. A good example of this idea is the idea of atoms. Until we had microsocpes powerful enough, no one ever saw one. That did not mean
                    that atoms did not exist, just that we couldn't see them.</p>

                  <p>grantc4's post about the human body and thought process as a deterministic system illustrates the greatest human dillemma of our time: The conflict between our objective conclusions and our internal desires. We would so like to
                    believe that someday we will be able to look back on our lives from a different perspective (Ie: an "afterlife"), but the conslusions of science tell us that once our brains die, our memory and entire concept of self is erased,
                    and our existence ceases, and even if the molecules which we were composed of end up as brain tissue in another person, that tissue will in no way give rise to a re-creation of self, nor will the passing of DNA (okay this part
                    about DNA may be speculatory at this point). My writing, at this very moment, is forgotten, and .... well, its hard to describe nonexistence..........
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The scientists' response to these conclusions is to furhter advance: "thus, we must not die!" They say. So, through engineering, the scientist hopes to actualize his inner desire of continuation of awareness and memory and
                    existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, a philosopher thinks to himself "well, if I am going to exist forever, in one form or another, I should not have to ACTIVELY MAINTAIN my existence (like the technologist hopes to), as there would be no certainty as to
                    whether I COULD maintain my existence, and thus, I could not truly exist forever. Eternal existence is something which you either are allowed by the nature of how things are, or not. If we are not allowed eternal existence, then
                    the universe truly is indifferent, and there is nothing wrong with that because that is the way it is. If we are allowed eternal existence, then the myths of spirituality are true, and that is the way things are. Under the first
                    possibility, the scientist is forced to forge an eternal existence because nature does not naturally supply him with one (this assumes that such technical ability can arise, and under this possibility, nonexistence is a sub
                    category). Under the second.... well, we all fantasize about that enough that I dont need to go into any explanation -right!-)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So what have I accomplished here? I guess the most quantifiable conclusion is that we all want to live forever in some state described in the myths. The difference between the scientific version of eternal life, and the mythical
                    version is that the mythical version does not involve the possibility that the function of existence will fail (as with the scientific version, your nanobots may glitch and destroy you).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Okay, I am not finished yet. Lets say the bots glitched and destroyed you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then the reader (you) say: well, the persons molecular state could be saved and re-created! Yes, but that means that a person is a machine: it all comes down to determinism vs self.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why cant they coexist?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why can there be no such thing as the self, if the function of the self is deterministic?
                    <br>

                  <p>I don't believe we act according to rules, but that a set of rules can be written to describe the regularities in our actions. Just as when we write a grammar that describes how we speak, a good grammar is descriptive rather
                    than prescriptive. A prescriptive grammar quickly becomes obsolete as the patterns of speach are always in flux. The same thing applies to our lives. A set of rules always describes the past and life is always reaching toward the
                    future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The fact that we have language allows us to change our ways more quickly than would be possible without it. We can use it to overcome the shorcoming of our genetic heritage. Every year, we are more than we were both as
                    individuals and as a society. Does that make our lives deterministic? The rules of past behavior do not predict or become the behavior of the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You might say it's pretty much like the stock market. The people who invest according to a set of rules they think they perceive in market behavior almost always come out losers when the market changes in ways that do not comply
                    with their rules. Then new rules are added in the hope that the new behavior has been captured. But there is always something that wasn't taken into account and makes a mockery of the rules.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Evolution, itself, precludes determinism. If life was locked up in a set of rules, there would be no evolution. Evolution is about change. But there are regularities that allow us to hold our shape as a species. It's not a case
                    of life being one or the other -- we are a product of both regularity and change. </p>

                    <br>
                    This isn't in fact true at least from an IQ correlate viewpoint. More recent stidies have show that genetically NON-identical twins separated at birth have similar IQs : the nurture vs nature debate is currently weighing in aat
                    about 20:80 in favour of nurture. In the case of NON-identical and identical twins , the common factor would seem yo be the mother's womb, but why this should be so imporatant ? One woudl think that its because its here that the
                    pre-learning brain GROWS, i.e becomes an effective organ. Most of the brain's connective matter develops after birth as well, in a manner dictated by a life spent 24 hours a day as that person in the varying environment. SO ino
                    order to reproduce the connective tissue of a brain you would have to have a) a genetic clone b) an identical gestative process and c ) he/she must move through the same places and the same this at that person , eating the same
                    food at the same time, taking the same drugs, getting hit on the head , having exactly the same sexual partners, brathing at the same time and having the same teachers etc. I think you'll find a) is the easiest part to deliver ,

                  <p>The other interesting thing to note is that DNA itself is not necessarily a fixed facor in relation to cell reproduction - it is known for instance that the unusually bad health of cloned animals is attributed, at least in the
                    case abnormal growth abnormalities, with a displaced methyl group that doesn't inhibit the activities of growth genes ay the right stage of development. DNA is the main 'common factor' that appears to crop up in current
                    understandings of cell reproduction : isolating the role of DNA in order to fulfil some neat information picture of life is to deny the obvious fact that DNA is PART of the picture of cell reproduction, not its entirety. </p>

                  <p>DNA is the the first step in an extremely complicated process. But even at this level, genes can be expressed or not expressed. The cloning process that starts with an and a sperm take the process from beginning to end, each
                    step triggering the next in the proper order. When a cell is taken from somewhere else in the body, many of the genes have already been expressed and are not triggered again when they are supposed to be. The cell has to be reset
                    somehow in order to start the process properly, Most cells used for cloning are like a row of dominos with some of the dominos missing or leading off to dead ends. But these are problems of learning and experience. The science is
                    too new for us to understand it completely. It will take a lot more experimentation and study before we approach the point where we should try to clone humans. But I do think we will get there some day.</p>

                  <p>The latest astronomical observations show that the universe is more likely to continue expansion to the point where all matter decomposes. Einstein proposed a theory on the future of the universe, in which the end
                    result(expansion or crunch) rests heavily on the total mass of the universe. This is actually calculatable- to an extent. However observations during his time contradicted with his conclusions, and he decided that there was
                    perhaps a universal constant that would explain for the seemingly (to him) expanding universe. Ultimately, he denounced his so called "hidden constant" as one of the greatest mistakes of his career. However current
                    studies/observations of dark matter show that Einstein may in fact have been right that the universe is undergoing an irretractable expansion.

                    <br>
                    But no matter what happens to the universe, there is no way to predict what may happen to us. Life as we know it will be incomprehensively different that far down the line. We may exist, we may not, or perhaps what we will be
                    won't fit our current definition of "existence"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is also a point that Ray Kurzweil has brought up:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most of the discussion in this forum is whether or not you can consider death and reconstruction to be one life, or two separate lives. Obviously, the only way to know if a life is continuous is that there is always some level of
                    consiousness- the body should never shut off completely. But consider this: our cells are always dying, replacing eachother. The atoms in our brain cells are always moving randomly. We are completely different people from one
                    year to another just as we are one hour to another. So if cells can die and be replaced without the fabric of life being broken, who's to say that a nano implant in the brain is "killing the soul". And if you can mechanize
                    someone with implants over a period of time, would they ever be a different person? And if not, what is stopping you from doing it all at once?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you were to "build" a being with the pure data of another, you are in effect giving birth to a new being, though the clone will obviously argue that he/she is in fact the real person. Or would they? I think that it's likely
                    that they would have some shred of memory that would indicate to them that they are a copy. If you were to download a consience, you would be in effect killing someone while simultaneously giving birth to another- Unless you
                    could do it while they remain conscious, I would be weary of any other method.</p>

                    In my view the singularity is just the infection of intelligence spreading through all the matter in the universe. Simply the logical conclusion of evolutions drive towards the universe itself becoming conscious (assuming it
                    isn't already). Given enough time this infection will spread through almost ALL the matter in the universe.

                    <br>
                    Just like we will one day be able to re-shape our bodies (which are just the substrate for our consciousness) at will, a conscious universe would be able to re-shape its matter at will.

                    <br>
                    This is a pretty far out idea, but 10^100 years is a pretty far out projection.

                  <p>tubadecuba, when I wrote about the universe expanding or crunching, I was talking exactly about this studies, but you made it more clear. Thanks
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I totally agree that there is no way to predict what will happens in 10^100 years. All I ca say about prediction is: When i think about 1991 i realize that at that time i couldn't even imagine what is happening now to me, to the
                    world, to technology, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But see my point: In this topic i was discussing if we could ever be immortals. And then i said that if immortal is someone that never dies and if the universe is going to have an end, then we would not be immortals, because of
                    the end of the universe. Of course there could be, lets say, a war that would kill all the human beings many years before the end of universe, but that's not the point.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let me give my opnion about whether or not you can consider death and reconstruction to be one life, or two separate lives. All we are, not as living creatures, but as social beings, depends on our memory. If in secret we clone a
                    person and his memory, keep him alive but hidden, I'm sure that his family never would know that the the clone was a clone. And the clone could never know that he was a clone. Now, if we could erase the last year of somebody's
                    memory I'm sure that all his friends and family wouldn't recognise him as the real one. To sum up: I don't think that there is a soul or something like that. A reconstructed person would be just as normal as a person who wakes up
                    in the morning as long as the memory is kept.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    stephenhanneke, i tend to agree with tomaz. I don't think that we will ever control the whole universe. I think there is too much energy, too much mass to be controled by us. Still i know that 10^100 years could give us some
                    surprises.</p>

                    Also, we must ask ourselves the following:
                    <br>
                    if time only exists inside the universe, then there would be no time after the universe. Should we claim that one who lives until the very end of time is not immortal? Are we to consider this end equivalent to death? The body
                    will not decay. For the person, it may seem only a passing moment; but perhaps one that never passes. Similar to those poor little photons we all hear about, chugging along at the speed of light on the very edge of the event
                    horizon of every black hole, but never moving a millimeter. We cannot claim that these particles are stationary, as they clearly travel at around 3x10^8 m/s. But we also cannot claim that they move. They just are. Can we judge
                    "living" or "dead" in an existence without time?

                    An immortal man is someone who lives from now until the end of time. If the time ends, then the person who dies at that time should still be called immortal.

                    maybe ther'll be some intergalactic teamwork in the distant future. Or perhaps theres already a race out there thats millions of years ahead of us.. for whatever reason. Thats a question I would like to see answered. </p>

                  <p>I was trying to say that the number of years doesn't mean more or less evolution. Some facts, like the Catholic Inquisition, could suspend the development of science and another race, that didn't had to face this facts, could
                    then become much more developed than we are.

                    if and when semiconducting technology reaches it's practical limits, something else will emerge... that's the way the world works. do you really believe that the industry will simply lay down and say "oh gee, it's getting too
                    hard to make faster chips so it looks like we're stuck at &lt;insert speed here&gt; for a few decades."

                  <p>This is somewhat witty at times, but on a literal level it's just not at all useful. I guess maybe I should cut this guy a little slack since he wrote this in the late 90's, but here's the problem: He read a couple articles on
                    futurism was immediately satisfied that he knew what they were saying. You can always tell the undereducated when they write about the future, because they keep harping on the same 2-3 things they read in those couple of
                    articles. Then they take all their assumptions based on their past, superimpose those things on the future, and think they're being incredibly clever and poignant with their projections. What they're being is ignorant. </p>
