<div class="TeaserText">In its second year of operation, 2002, KurzweilAI.net continued to chronicle the most notable news stories on accelerating intelligence. We offer here our overview of the dramatic progress that the past year has brought.  Following that, we selected just over half of the 823 news stories posted in 2002 to document key breakthroughs in the continued exponential growth of increasingly diverse information-based technologies; deepening understanding of the information basis of biological processes; the early contributions of nanotechnology, and a multiplicity of related topics.  </div>
<br>
<br><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net Feb. 5, 2003</i>
<p>
			The capital markets (venture and angel financing, IPOs, mergers and 
            acquisitions, bank debt) were in a deep freeze during 2002, particularly 
            for high-tech ventures. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> market capitalizations continued 
            their downward trend from the previous year, and many ventures ended 
            their <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s for lack of funding. 
            <p>So one might assume that this high tech recession might have slowed 
              the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. A frequent question I (Ray) receive at my 
              lectures is what impact the high-tech meltdown has had on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614005453/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html" target="_top">law 
              of accelerating returns</a>. Surely, many people point out, the 
              acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and other technologies must have been 
              negatively affected.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> is alive and 
              well. We see no impact of either the boom times nor the bust on 
              the ongoing and unperturbed acceleration of the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. 
              The doubling of <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> in a wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              technologies, including <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, magnetic and <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> 
              memories, <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s 
              and mechanics, genomic sequencing, neural scanning, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> reverse 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and many others, has continued unabated. </p>
<p>The pace of innovation itself has also been undeterred. The unavailability 
              of investment has served primarily to weed out poorly grounded ideas 
              and projects. The <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of innovation is so deeply embedded in 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> and culture that <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> has not only continued to 
              flourish, but even the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of fields and types of applications 
              continue to multiply. </p>
<p>All of this is eminently apparent from the depth and <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> 
              of last year's torrent of groundbreaking news as chronicled here 
              on KurzweilAI.net. We <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> a high bar for news stories, and nonetheless 
              posted 823 of them&#8212;more than two each day. We've selected just 
              over half of these below to document the key breakthroughs in the 
              continued <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of these increasingly diverse <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based 
              technologies; our deepening understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> basis 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes; and the early contributions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. 
            </p>
<p>A frequent challenge that I (Ray) receive is that while it is apparent 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> technologies are growing exponentially, the same is 
              not true for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. To this end, we hear an endless litany of 
              frustrations with poorly designed <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, and the complaint that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is no more intelligent today than it was years ago. My 
              own view is that the "doubling time" for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> 
              is indeed slower than that for <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> (I estimate it to be around 
              five years versus one year for <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>), but we are indeed benefiting 
              from all the investments in new <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s, class libraries, and 
              development tools. </p>
<h2>Smart <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and consumer robots</h2>
            Consider one dramatic example that we saw in 2002. It is often said 
            that game-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> and 
            Deep Fritz, rely entirely on brute force expansion of the move-countermove 
            tree. But there is an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant aspect of these <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that requires 
            qualitative <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, namely the evaluation of the "terminal 
            leaves" of this tree. It would not be an intelligent use of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to endlessly expand every branch of the tree. For example, if 
            one side was down by a queen and a rook at a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/node_entry.html">node</a> in a 
            branch, there would be little point in considering that line of play 
            further. So the classical "minimax" game-playing strategy 
            does require an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant judgment at each <a class="thought" href="entries/node_entry.html">node</a> of the tree: should 
            we abandon or continue the expansion? 
            <p><a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>, which defeated Gary Kasparov, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> world champion, 
              in 1987, used a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of several hundred finely tuned <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s to 
              make this delicate decision. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> consisted of specialized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s that were able to analyze 200 million board positions 
              per second. <a href="#deep fritz">Deep Fritz</a>, which competed during 2002, is simply a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> running on eight conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>-class processors, 
              and thus is only able to consider about three million board positions 
              per second. </p>
<p>Despite this, it ranked about equal to <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> and fought Vladimir 
              Kramnik, the contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> world champion, to a draw. This 
              impressive performance, despite using a small fraction of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
              used by <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>, is entirely due to <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant qualitative improvements 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of its pruning <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. </p>
<p><b><a href="#ai">AI</a></b> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s played a key role in many practical 
              applications. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you send an <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a> or place a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone 
              call, you are calling upon increasingly sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s 
              to route your <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you make a credit card purchase, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s are analyzing the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of your purchases 
              to look for <a href="#fraud"></a>fraud. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s have also been deployed on the emerging 
              homeland security front, featuring the ability to detect <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s 
              that identify potential <a href="#terrorist behavior">terrorist behavior</a>, <a href="#bioterrorism">bioterrorism outbreaks</a>, 
              and terrorist or criminal movements. 
            <p>In <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614005453/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?m=12" target="_top">The  Age of Intelligent Machines</a></i>, which I wrote in the late 1980s, 
              I predicted that <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a> would be transformed from the variables 
              that had dominated strategy from ancient times &#8212;geography, offensive 
              firepower, and defensive fortifications &#8212;to the sophistication 
              of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. We were headed towards 
              an era in which combat would increasingly be conducted by <a href="#Good Morning"></a>intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, with humans (at least those on the winning side) becoming 
              increasingly removed from the scene of conflict. </p>
<p>The Persian Gulf War of 1991 saw the early use of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, 
              although only about five percent of our munitions were "smart." 
              In this past year, the majority of our <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s were "smart" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s during the Afghanistan conflict, and estimates are that 
              95 percent of our munitions will be intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s for the 
              Iraqi conflict of 2003 (assuming that President Hussein does not 
              back down in the face of our smarter <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>). 
            </p>
<p>In 2002, we saw the Pentagon turn to terrestrial robots and airborne 
              drones for <a href="#war of robots">spying</a>, detecting <a href="#mines">land mines</a>, and combat in Afghanistan. 
              Looking ahead, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers are actively developing smarter and smaller 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, for example, flying robots modeled on <a href="#insects">insects and birds</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#Robotics"></a><a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a> made notable advances on the civilian side as well, including 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on <a href="#sociable">sociable robots</a>, ones that can <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> <a href="#emotions">human emotions</a>, 
              highly mobile robots modeled on <a href="#cockroach"></a>cockroaches, a <a href="#mobile">mobile robot</a> that 
              can learn in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> by matching images with its <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and one 
              controlled by a hybrid <a href="#rat">rat-silicon brain</a>. Notably one <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a href="#flying">taught 
              itself the principles of flying by trial and error</a> in just three 
              hours. </p>
<p>Consumer robots also made news, including a <a href="#housecleaning">housecleaning robot</a>, 
              a realistic <a href="#cat">cat toy</a>, a walking-talking <a href="#car">Honda car salesman</a>, and&#8212;shades of the movie <i>A.I.</i>&amp;#8212a <a href="#child">child robot</a> that can interact with its 
              "carers," expressing <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s.</p>
<p>Robots also found another popular consumer role as "<b><a href="#robodocs">robodocs</a></b>" 
              in elder care facilities and homes, in the form of cuddly <a href="#bear">bears</a> and <a href="#AIBO">AIBO dogs</a> to offer social stimulation and <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to <a href="#monitor">monitor patients' medical condition and behavior</a>
              and <a href="#directions">give directions</a> to Alzheimers patients when lost. Remote-control 
              robots were also used by doctors for <a href="#surgery">precision heart surgery</a>.</p>
<p>There were also improvements in <a href="#speech">speech recognition</a>, speech
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, and <a href="#nlp">natural language processing</a>.  </p><p>
              A new category of business ventures focuses on developing virtual 
              personalities that will handle routine transactions over the phone, 
              such as making reservations and conducting purchases and performing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              queries. Many of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s were rolled out during 2002. </p>
<p>For example, you can call British Airways and talk to their automated 
              attendant about anything you want, as long as it has to do with 
              booking a flight with British Airways. Other developments included 
              optimized <a href="#dictation">dictation</a> along with voice-controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a> and Web surfing, 
              a <a href="#talking book">talking book</a> for the blind, <a href="#full-text search"> full-text search of audio recordings</a>,

<p>Several <b><a href="#computing">computing</a></b> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> breakthroughs were announced, including

                    RODS was initially installed in Western Pennsylvania in August 
                    of 1999 for public health surveillance for the 3 million residents 
                    of 13 counties. So far, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has detected only a naturally 
                    occurring outbreak of influenza. It is now being extended 
                    to all of Pennsylvania. Other public health departments in 
                    the U.S. are now showing interest in RODS. Given how quickly 
                    it was installed in Utah, RODS principal investigator Michael 
                    Wagner, M.D., believes it could also be <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed in other

<p>With more than 1 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s per square centimeter, 
                    a hypothetical "Knowm <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a>" would overcome the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al

                    by using nano-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, according to the company's 
                    Web site. <br>
<br>
                    "When nano-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s in a dielectric solution are exposed 
                    to an electric field, the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s align with the electric 
                    field," the site explains. "As the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s align, the resistance 
                    between the respective electrodes decreases and any connection 
                    formed becomes stable after the electric field is removed. 
                    <br>
<br>
                    "As the strength or frequency of the applied electric field 
                    is increased, the connection becomes increasingly aligned 
                    and the resistance further decreases. By applying a perpendicular 
                    electric field, one can also decrease the strength of the 
                    connections. <br>
<br>
                    "Because of the small size of nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s in the dielectric 
                    solution, extremely dense physical <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> arrays can be built. 
                    The result is a fully modifiable nano-connection that can

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers utilize a process invented at Northwestern's

                    smaller than those used in conventional arrays. This leads

<p>Cornell University <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have designed a groundbreaking 
                    molecular motor, only billionths of a meter in scale. <br>
<br>
                    The <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>, which was only theoretical just a few years 
                    ago, heralds what <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s describe as the next industrial 
                    revolution: molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. This type of self-propelled

                    <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> cells. <br>
</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> team, headed by Carlo Montemagno, modeled their 
                    molecular stator and rotor after an enzyme found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
                    called <a class="thought" href="entries/atpase_entry.html">ATPase</a>, which is responsible for converting food to

                    motors naturally occur on the membranes of <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a> and 
                    in plant chloroplasts. The moving part of <a class="thought" href="entries/atpase_entry.html">ATPase</a> is a central 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> shaft (or rotor), less than 12 nanometers in diameter, 
                    that rotates in response to electrochemical reactions. <br>
<br>
                    Montemagno, an assistant professor of agricultural and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, harvested the <a class="thought" href="entries/atpase_entry.html">ATPase</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from Escherichia

                    enzyme. <br>
<br>
                    To turn <a class="thought" href="entries/atpase_entry.html">ATPase</a> into a motor capable of mechanical work, he 
                    separated the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> membrane. He then attached 
                    them, using a synthetic peptide, to metallic <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s of 
                    nanofabricated <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of gold, copper or nickel. These metals

                    <br>
<br>
                    This type of connection may allow <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to one day integrate

<br>
                    The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers bonded propeller-like filaments, made from 
                    polymerized <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s to the top of the motor shaft. The <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> 
                    "props," ranging from 0.5 to 8 microns long, were made of 
                    a material that would fluoresce under certain wavelengths

<p>Scientists say they have genetically modified rice to withstand 
                    drought, salt water and cold temperatures by borrowing a gene 
                    from the E. coli <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. They hope the new stress-tolerant 
                    rice will help farmers in poor countries grow more food under

<p>Doctors are developing artificial wombs in which <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s 
                    can grow outside a woman's body. The work has been hailed 
                    as a breakthrough in treating the childless. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is headed by Dr. Hung-Ching Liu of Cornell University's 
                    Center for Reproductive <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> and Infertility. Liu's work 
                    involves removing cells from the endometrium, the lining of 
                    the womb. <br>
<br>
                    After this Liu and her colleagues grew layers of these cells 
                    on scaffolds of biodegradable material which had been modelled 
                    into shapes mirroring the interior of the uterus. The cells 
                    grew into tissue and the scaffold dissolved. Then nutrients 
                    and hormones such as estrogen were added to the tissue. <br>
<br>
                    "Finally, we took <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s left over from IVF <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mes and 
                    put these into our laboratory <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered tissue. The <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s 
                    attached themselves to the walls of our prototype wombs and 
                    began to settle there." <br>
<br>
                    The immediate aim of this work is to help women whose damaged 
                    wombs prevent them from conceiving. An artificial womb would 
                    be made from their own endometrium cells, an <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> placed 
                    inside it, and allowed to settle and grow before the whole 
                    package is placed back in her body. <br>
<br>
                    The <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s were halted after six days. However, Liu now 
                    plans to continue with this <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and allow <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s to 
                    grow in the artificial wombs for 14 days, the maximum permitted 
                    by IVF legislation. <br>
<br>
                    Artificial wombs raise major ethical headaches which will 
                    be debated at a major international conference titled "The 
                    End of Natural Motherhood?" in Oklahoma next week. <br>
<br>
                    Ethical and social issues include abortion, the prospect that 
                    gay couples could give "birth" to their own children by combining 
                    artificial wombs with cloning, and unexpected consequences 
                    for working women and health insurance (materity leave would 
                    no longer be needed and artificial wombs insurance companies 
                    might prefer safer environments than natural wombs, which 
                    can be invaded by drugs and alcohol from a mother's body).

                    The assemblage is so small that surgeons can't safely handle

                    into an eyeball, the polymer film will simply dissolve leaving 
                    only the array behind. <br>

<p>The incredibly accurate hearing mechanism of the Ormia ochracea's 
                    ears have evolved the ability to pinpoint the location of 
                    chirping crickets, thanks to its two eardrums. The one closer 
                    to the sound vibrates more loudly than the other, detecting 
                    a <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>'s direction within one or two degrees. <br>

<br>
                    He described a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> implant the size of a grain of rice 
                    developed at UCLA by a team led by Dr. Gerald Loeb. This can

                    between nerves and bionic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. <br>
<br>
                    Craelius said while it may require more than 1,000 connections 
                    between the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and bionic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to communicate the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>

                    even if most of the necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> processing is done 
                    outside the body. <br>
<br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">Miniaturization</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s will soon bring even that processing

                    18 months," he said. "At this pace, within the decade, the 
                    processing for complex bionic activity will be implantable 
                    in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> or elsewhere in the body." <br>
<br>
                    While scientists are eliminating obstacles to <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> 
                    and <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> of bionics, they still need to devise 
                    ways to protect the tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> interference 
                    and corrosion from bodily fluids, Craelius said. Battery <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
                    and recharging are also concerns as the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s handle an

<br>
                    "Finally, users who subject themselves to <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> implantation 
                    of hundreds of electrodes are not going to want bulky plastic 
                    sockets for their new bionic limbs. Creating a more natural 
                    integration between the limb and existing bone is going to

                    restoration." <br>
<br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> feel is an area Craelius is addressing in his own work 
                    with Dextra, an artificial hand he developed along with a 
                    team of Rutgers students and Nian-Crae, Inc. The prosthesis 
                    gives a person who has lost a hand natural control of up to 
                    five independent artificial fingers, controlled by electrical 
                    signals generated by the user's remaining muscles and tendons. 
                    <br>
<br>
                    Dextra has been demonstrated to permit such complex hand activities 
                    as typing and piano playing. It has a plastic socket that 
                    encases an amputee's upper limb and some of the processing

<p>Previously, <a class="thought" href="entries/hp_entry.html">HP</a> demonstrated in the laboratory how some rare

                    Two sets of facing parallel wires, oriented roughly perpendicular 
                    to each other, could then be made into a grid. The problem 
                    is that on a single large grid, all the electrical signals

                    is to cut the wires into smaller lengths by turning some "intersections" 
                    into insulators. <br>

<p>In a feat of nanometer-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have 
                    produced <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> filaments that are as thin as viruses 
                    but contain working <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and optical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. Alternating 
                    bands of different <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> materials in the superthin 
                    wires serve as the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> manipulators. Someday, 
                    such striped strands may form the basis of a new type of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry 
                    that is far tinier, faster, and more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> efficient than 
                    conventional chips will ever be, the scientists say. <br>
</p>
<p>A Harvard University team led by Charles M. Lieber and two 
                    other teams-'one led by Peidong Yang at the University of 
                    California, Berkeley and the other led by Lars Samuelson of 
                    Lund University in Sweden&#8212;have unveiled striped <a class="thought" href="entries/nanowire_entry.html">nanowire</a>s 
                    resembling submicroscopic barber poles. Each stripe has a 
                    different composition, and thereby different <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> properties. 
                    <br>
<br>
                    Electrical measurements by the Harvard and Lund groups show 
                    that the junction of just two adjacent stripes within one 
                    wire can be a diode that guides <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s. Lieber and his 
                    colleagues also report making within a single wire a type 
                    of diode that emits <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and constructed a prototype, one-wire 
                    "nano'bar <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>" that fluoresces under green <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> in alternating 
                    dark and bright stripes. It's possible, they claim, to make 
                    stacks of multiple colors that would be leaner than any microscopic 
                    bar <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> rods created so far and might label and track <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>

<p>James Heath, of the University of California and colleagues 
                    have demonstrated that if one or both of two wires crossed 
                    at right angles are semiconducting, the junction can act like

<p>he world's smallest thermometer consisting of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>

<p>The nanothermometer is 10 micrometers long and has a diameter

<p>A team of Australian and US scientists has discovered a new 
                    type of nanoparticle-enhanced filter for separating compounds 
                    at the molecular level, as reported in the April 19 issue 
                    of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>The new "nanocomposites" filters are created by combining 
                    organic polymers, normally used to make membrane filters, 
                    with inorganic substances&#8212;in this case a mist of silica 
                    nanoparticles. <br>
<br>
                    The team discovered that this combination allows the membrane 
                    to filter gases and organic vapors at the molecular level. 
                    <br>
<br>
                    Possible uses include biomolecule purification, environmental 
                    remediation, seawater desalination and petroleum chemicals

<p><a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers have succeeded in creating a reversible quantum

</p>
<p>A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is created by cooling a

<br>
                    The investigators at Ludwig-Maximilians University placed 
                    the BEC in an optical lattice&amp;#8212a three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>

                    the intensity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beams making up the optical lattice, 
                    the atoms lost their <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> and each became trapped in a

                    In a commentary to the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> report, physicist Henk T. Stoof 
                    of Utrecht University said, "Every rubidium <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> has a magnetic

                    atoms in the optical lattice, he says, they could provide

                    the unmanned spy plane has gone from a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> player to a starring 
                    role in Pentagon planning. Rather than the handful of "autonomous 
                    vehicles," or A.V.'s, that snooped on Al Qaeda hideouts, commanders 
                    are envisioning wars involving vast robotic fleets on the 
                    ground, in the air and on the seas&#8212;swarms of drones that 
                    will not just find their foes, but fight them, too. </p>

                    an economist and an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> industry analyst, said of 
                    Foveon's sensor. <br>
<br>
                    Foveon's sensor, rather than break images into separate colors 
                    and distribute them among separate pixels, captures color 
                    by measuring how deeply <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> penetrate the surface 
                    of the imaging material. Not only is there higher resolution 
                    from a given <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of pixels, but there is less loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> 
                    and less need for the correcting calculations that can distort 
                    the image. <br>
<br>
                    Industry experts say that one of the most intriguing aspects 
                    of the Foveon sensors is that they might allow for a hybrid

<p>Conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/hologram_entry.html">hologram</a>s are made by splitting a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beam 
                    in two, reflecting one of the resulting beams (aptly named 
                    the "<a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>" beam) off the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, recombining the two, and 
                    exposing the result to a piece of photographic film. The interference 
                    between the two sub-beams produces a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> on the film which, 
                    when developed and illuminated, reveals a three-dimensional 
                    picture of the original <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>. <br>
<br>
                    According to the company, "The process is lengthy, complicated, 
                    and requires the use of expensive, high-powered lasers, making 
                    it impractical for widespread <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> use. Unfortunately, 
                    it also results in holographic images of limited size, color,

                    With Zebra's new process, the image is projected through an 
                    LCD screen on which a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-generated image is displayed. 
                    The process allows for <a class="thought" href="entries/hologram_entry.html">hologram</a>s to be generated quickly,

<p>The just-released movie Simone presents an "unrealistic notion 
                    of how <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is introduced to the world," says <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> 
                    in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614005453/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0514.html" target="_top">movie

<p>"By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the 'perfection' presumably represented by Simone 
                    is feasible, the public will be very familiar with the idea 
                    of a virtual actress. Technologies such as these never burst 
                    on the scene fully formed with no imperfections as is displayed 
                    in this film." <br>
<br>
                    Kurzweil examines this portrayal from the perspective of his 
                    own transformation at the TED conference into <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, the 
                    state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> for real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> virtual personality transformation 
                    two years ago. <br>
<br>
                    Kurzweil also chides Simone's producers for the film's failure 
                    to show interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_generated_imagery_entry.html">CGI</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics imaging) effects 
                    and its technically unrealistic <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, such as a one-man 
                    production team able to create a live holographic performance 
                    by Simone. <br>
<br>
                    Nonetheless, he found the film enjoyable to watch and he "appreciated 
                    the inevitably imperfect manner that it introduces some of 
                    the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>

I see lots of basic research occuring all over the world. Many countries are jumping in so they don't get left out and existing companies are keeping their core research efforts strong to be ready and competitive!

<br>
Soon I suspect there may be some "order of magnitude" jumps in some areas due to convergence etc.

I like the last paragraph.......

"Of particular interest were analyses showing the theoretical feasibility of quantum wormholes, which may offer short cuts to the rest of the cosmos."
