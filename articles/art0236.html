<div class="TeaserText">A counterpoint to Jaron Lanier's dystopian visions of runaway technological cataclysm in "One Half of a Manifesto."</div>

<p>Postscript regarding Ray Kurzweil can be read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231359/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0233.html" target="_self">here</a>. "One Half of a Manifesto" can be read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231359/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0232.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/lanier_entry.html">Jaron Lanier</a>'s Postscript, which he wrote after he and I spoke in succession at a Vanguard <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, Lanier points out that we agree on many things, which indeed we do. So I'll start in that vein as well. First of all, I share the world's esteem for Jaron's pioneering work in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, including his innovative contemporary work on the "Teleimmersion" initiative, and, of course, in coining the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>." I probably have higher regard for <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> than Jaron does, but that comes back to our distinct views of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>As an aside I'm not entirely happy with the phrase "<a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>" as it implies that it's not a real place to be. I consider a telephone conversation as being together in auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, yet we regard these to be real conversations. I have a similar problem with the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>."</p>
<p>And as a pioneer in what I believe will become a transforming concept in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, I know that Jaron shares with me an underlying enthusiasm for the contributions that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and related <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s technologies can have on the quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. That is the other half of his manifesto. I appreciate Jaron pointing this out. It's not entirely clear sometimes, for example, that <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> has another half to his manifesto.</p>
<p>And I agree with at least one of Jaron's six objections to what he calls "Cybernetic Totalism." In objection #3, he takes issues with those who maintain "that <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> either doesn't exist, or is unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect." The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that some people feel this way is precisely because <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> cannot be scientifically measured. Although we can measure certain correlates of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> (e.g., correlating certain patterns of objectively measurable neurological activity with objectively verifiable reports of certain <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>s), we cannot penetrate to the core of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> through objective measurement. It's the difference between the concept of "objectivity," which is the basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, and "subjectivity," which is essentially a synonym for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> we can postulate that could definitively detect subjectivity associated with an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, at least no such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that does not have philosophical assumptions built into it.</p>
<p>So I accept that <a class="thought" href="entries/lanier_entry.html">Jaron Lanier</a> has <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>s, and I can even imagine (and empathize with!) his feelings of frustration at the dictums of "cybernetic totalists" such as myself (not that I accept this characterization) as he wrote his half manifesto. Like Jaron, I even accept the <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of those who maintain that there is no such thing as <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>. Of course, most people do accept that other people are conscious, but this shared <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> assumption breaks down as we go outside of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> experience, e.g., the debates regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> rights (which have everything to do with whether <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s are conscious or just quasi-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that operate by "<a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>"), as well as the debates regarding the notion that a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> could conceivably be conscious.</p>
<p>Consider that we are unable to truly experience the <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>s of others. We hear their reports about their experiences, and we may even feel empathy in response to the behavior that results from their internal states. We are, however, only exposed to the behavior of others and, therefore, can only imagine their <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>. So one can construct a perfectly consistent, and scientific, worldview that omits the existence of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. And because there is fundamentally no scientific way to measure the <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of another <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, some observers come to the conclusion that it's just an illusion.</p>
<p>My own view is that precisely because we cannot resolve issues of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> entirely through objective measurement and analysis, i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, there is a critical role for <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, which we sometimes call <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>. I would agree with Jaron that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is the most important ontological question. After all, if we truly imagine a world in which there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>, i.e., a world in which there is swirling stuff but no conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> to experience it, then that world may as well not exist. In some philosophical traditions (i.e., some interpretations of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, some schools of Buddhist <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>), that is exactly how such a world is regarded.</p>
<p>I like Jaron's term "circle of empathy," which makes it clear that the circle of reality that I consider to be "me" is not clear-cut. One's circle of empathy is certainly not simply our body, as we have limited identification with, say, our toes, and even less with the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of our large intestines. Even with regard to our brains, we are aware of only a small portion of what goes on in our brains, and often consider <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and dreams that suddenly intrude on our awareness to have come from some foreign place. We do often include loved ones who may be physically disparate within our circle of empathy. Thus the aspect of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> that I consider to be "myself" is not at all clear cut, and some philosophies do emphasize the extent to which there is inherently no such boundary.</p>
<p>Having stated a few ways in which Jaron and I agree with each other's perspective, I will say that his "Half of a Manifesto" mischaracterizes many of the views he objects to. Certainly that's true with regard to his characterization of my own thesis. In particular, he appears to have only picked up on half of what I said in Atlanta, because the other half addresses at least some of the issues he raises. Moreover, many of Jaron's arguments aren't really arguments at all, but a amalgamation of mentally filed anecdotes and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering frustrations. The fact that <i><a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a></i> magazine got a prediction wrong in 1966, as Jaron reports, is not a compelling argument that all discussions of trends are misguided. Nor is the fact that dinosaurs did not continue to increase in size indefinitely a demonstration that every trend quickly dies out. The size of dinosaurs is irrelevant; a larger size may or may not impart an advantage, whereas an increase in the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> and/or <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> clearly does impart an advantage. It would be hard to make the case that a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> with a lower <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> had inherent advantages, whereas it is certainly possible that a smaller and therefore more agile <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> may have advantages.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/lanier_entry.html">Jaron Lanier</a> has what my colleague Lucas Hendrich calls the "<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er's pessimism." Often an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er or scientist who is so immersed in the difficulties of a contemporary challenge fails to appreciate the ultimate long-term implications of their own work, and, in particular, the larger field of work that they operate in. Consider the biochemists in 1985 who were skeptical of the announcement of the goal of transcribing the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> in a mere 15 years. These scientists had just spent an entire year transcribing a mere one ten-thousandth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, so even with <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able anticipated advances, it seemed to them like it would be hundreds of years, if not longer, before the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> could be sequenced. Or consider the skepticism expressed in the mid 1980s that the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> would ever be a significant phenomenon, given that it included only tens of thousands of nodes. The fact that the number of nodes was doubling every year and there were, therefore, likely to be tens of millions of nodes ten years later was not appreciated by those who struggled with "state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>" <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in 1985, which permitted adding only a few thousand nodes throughout the world in a year.</p>
<p>In his "Postscript regarding Ray Kurzweil," Jaron asks the rhetorical question "about Ray's exponential theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>...[is he] stacking the deck by choosing points that fit the curves he wants to find?" I can assure Jaron that the more points we add to the dozens of exponential graphs I presented to him and the rest of the audience in Atlanta, the clearer the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s become. Does he really imagine that there is some circa 1901 calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that has better <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> than our circa 2001 <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s? Or even a 1995 <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that is competitive with a 2001 <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>? In fact what we do see as more points (representing specific <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s) are collected is a cascade of "S-curves," in which each S-curve represents some specific technological <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. Each S-curve (which looks like an "S" in which the top portion is stretched out to the right) starts out with gradual and then extreme <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, subsequently leveling off as the potential of that <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> is exhausted. But what turns each S-curve into an ongoing exponential is the shift to another <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, and thus to another S-curve, i.e., innovation. The pressure to explore and discover a new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> increases as the limits of each current <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> becomes apparent.</p>
<p>When it became impossible to shrink <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s any further and maintain the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s came along, which are not merely small <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s. We've been through five <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s in computing in this past century (electromechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, relay-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>-tube-based computing, discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, and then <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, on which <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a> is based). As the limits of flat <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s are now within sight (one to one and a half decades away), there are already dozens of projects underway to pioneer the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of computing, which is computing in three dimensions, several of which have demonstrated small-scale working <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>It is specifically the processing and movement of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that is growing exponentially. So one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that an area such as transportation is resting at the top of an S-curve is that many if not most of the purposes of transportation have been satisfied by exponentially growing <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies. My own organization has colleagues in different parts of the country, and most of our needs that in times past would have required a person or a package to be transported can be met through the increasingly viable virtual meetings made possible by a panoply of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies, some of which Jaron is himself working to advance. Having said that, I do believe we will see new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s in transportation. However, with increasingly realistic, high-resolution full-immersion forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> continuing to emerge, our needs to be together will increasingly be met through <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>.</p>
<p>Jaron's concept of "lock-in" is not the primary obstacle to advancing transportation. If the existence of a complex support <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> necessarily caused lock-in, then why don't we see lock-in preventing ongoing expansion of every aspect of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>? After all, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> certainly requires an enormous and complex infrastructure. The primary <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that transportation is under little pressure for a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>-shift is that the underlying need for transportation has been increasingly met through <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies that are expanding exponentially.</p>
<p>One of Jaron's primary themes is to distinguish between quantitative and qualitative trends, saying in essence that perhaps certain brute force capabilities such as <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> capacity, processor speed, and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>s are expanding exponentially, but the qualitative aspects are not. And toward this end, Jaron complains of a multiplicity of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> frustrations (many, incidentally, having to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a>) that plague both users and, in particular, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> developers like himself.</p>
<p>This is the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> versus <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> challenge, and it is an important one. Jaron does not mention at all my primary thesis having to do with the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Jaron characterizes my position and that of other so-called "cybernetic totalists" to be that we'll just figure it out in some unspecified way, what he refers to as a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> "Deus ex Machina." I have a specific and detailed scenario to achieve the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, which concerns the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, an undertaking that is much further along than most people realize. I'll return to this in a moment, but first I would like to address some other <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> misconceptions about the so-called lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p>Jaron calls <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> inherently "unwieldy" and "brittle" and writes at great length on a variety of frustrations that he encounters in the world of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. He writes that "getting <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to perform specific tasks of significant <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> in a reliable but modifiable way, without crashes or security breaches, is essentially impossible." I certainly don't want to put myself in the position of defending all <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> (any more than I would care to characterize all people as wonderful). But it's not the case that complex <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is necessarily brittle and prone to catastrophic breakdown. There are many examples of complex mission critical <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that operates with very little if any breakdowns, for example the sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that controls an increasing fraction of airplane landings, or <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that monitors patients in critical care facilities. I am not aware of any airplane crashes that have been caused by automated landing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>; the same, however, cannot be said for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> reliability.</p>
<p>Jaron says that "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s tend to respond more slowly to user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> events, such as a keypress, than they did fifteen years ago...What's gone wrong?" To this I would invite Jaron to try using an old <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> today. Even we put aside the difficulty of setting one up today (which is a different issue), Jaron has forgotten just how unresponsive, unwieldy, and limited they were. Try getting some real work done to today's standards with a fifteen year-old <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>. It's simply not true to say that the old <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> was better in any qualitative or quantitative <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. If you believe that, then go use them.</p>
<p>Although it's always possible to find poor quality design, the primary <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> response delays is user demand for more sophisticated functionality. If users were willing to freeze the functionality of their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, then the ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> would quickly eliminate <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> response delays. But they're not. So functionality always stays on the edge of what's feasible (personally, I'm waiting for my Teleimmersion upgrade to my videoconferencing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>).</p>
<p>This romancing of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> from years or decades ago is comparable to people's idyllic view of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> hundreds of years ago, when we were unencumbered with the frustrations of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> was unencumbered, perhaps, but it was also short (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy less than half of today's), labor-intensive (e.g., just preparing the evening meal took many hours of hard labor), poverty-filled, disease and disaster prone.</p>
<p>With regard to the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the comparisons in virtually every area are dramatic. For example, in 1985 $5,000 bought you a speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> package that provided a 1,000 word vocabulary, no continuous speech capability, required three hours of training, and had relatively poor accuracy. Today, for only $50, you can purchase a speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> package with a 100,000 word vocabulary, continuous speech, that requires only five minutes of training, has dramatically improved accuracy, <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding ability (for editing commands and other purposes), and many other features.</p>
<p>How about <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> development itself? I've been developing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> myself for forty years, so I have some perspective on this. It's clear that the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> development has a lower exponent, but it is nonetheless growing exponentially. The development tools, class libraries, and support <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s available today are dramatically more effective than those of decades ago. I have today small teams of just three or four people who achieve objectives in a few months that are comparable to what a team of a dozen or more people could accomplish in a year or more 25 years ago. I estimate the doubling <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> to be approximately six years, which is slower than the doubling <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for processor <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a>, which is approximately one year today. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> is nonetheless growing exponentially.</p>
<p>The most important point to be made here is that there is a specific game plan for achieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. I agree that achieving the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> capacity is a necessary but not sufficient condition. As I mentioned above, we have a resource for understanding how to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> the methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> given <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> that is up to the task, and that resource is the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself.</p>
<p>Here again, if you speak to some of the neurobiologists who are diligently creating detailed mathematical models of the hundreds of types of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s found in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, or who are modeling the patterns of connections found in different regions, you will in at least a few cases encounter the same sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er's / scientist's myopia that results from being immersed in the specifics of one aspect of a large challenge. However, having tracked the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> being made in accumulating all of the (yes, exponentially increasing) <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and its <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, I believe that it is a conservative scenario to expect that within thirty years we will have detailed models of the several hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing organs we collectively call the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a> has successfully synthesized (that is, assembled and integrated) the detailed models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and interconnections in more than a dozen regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> having to do with auditory processing. He has a detailed model of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> transformations that take place in these regions, and how this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is encoded, and has implemented these models in <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. The performance of Watt's <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> matches the intricacies that have been revealed in subtle experiments on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> hearing and auditory discrimination. Most interestingly, using Watts' models as the front-end in speech recognition has demonstrated the ability to pick out one speaker against a backdrop of background sounds, an impressive feat that humans are capable of, and that up until Watts' work, had not been feasible in automated speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not one big neural net. It consists of hundreds of regions, each of which is organized differently, with different types of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, different types of signaling, and different patterns of interconnections. By and large, the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s are not the sequential, logical methods that are commonly used in <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> tends to use self-organizing, chaotic, holographic (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> not in one place but distributed throughout a region), massively parallel, and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-controlled-<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> methods. However, we have demonstrated in a wide range of projects the ability to understand these methods, and to extract them from the rapidly escalating <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and its organization.</p>
<p>The speed, cost effectiveness, and <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning is also growing exponentially, doubling every year. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> models is also rapidly growing. The size of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters that we have successfully recreated in terms of functional equivalence is also scaling up exponentially.</p>
<p>I am not saying that this process of <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is the only route to "strong" <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. It is, however, a critical source of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that is feeding into our overall <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> activities where these methods are integrated with other approaches.</p>
<p>Also, it is not the case that the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, and therefore its "brittleness" needs to scale up dramatically in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to emulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, even when we get to emulating its full functionality. My own area of technical interest is <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, and the methods that we typically use are self-organizing methods such as neural nets, <a class="thought" href="entries/markov_model_entry.html">Markov model</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s. When <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up in the right way, these methods can often display subtle and complex behaviors that are not predictable by the designer putting them into practice. I'm not saying that such self-organizing methods are an easy short cut to creating complex and intelligent behavior, but they do represent one important way in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can be increased without the brittleness of explicitly <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med logical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>Consider that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself is created from a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> with only 23 million bytes of useful <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (that's what's left of the 800 million <a class="thought" href="entries/byte_entry.html">byte</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> when you eliminate all the redundancies, e.g., the sequence "<a class="thought" href="entries/alu_entry.html">ALU</a>" which is repeated hundreds of thousands of times). 23 million bytes is not that much <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (it's less than <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word). How is it, then, that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with its 100 trillion connections can result from a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> that is so small? I have estimated that just the interconnection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> alone to characterize the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a million times greater than the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>.</p>
<p>The answer is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> specifies a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of processes, each of which utilizes chaotic methods (i.e., initial randomness, then <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a>) to increase the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> represented. It is known, for example, that the wiring of the interconnections follows a plan that includes a great deal of randomness. As the individual person encounters her environment, the connections and the <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> level patterns self-organize to better represent the world, but the initial design is specified by a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that is not extreme in its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.</p>
<p>It is not my position that we will <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> link by link as in some huge <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">CYC</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>. Nor is it the case that we will simply <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a huge genetic (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary) <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> and have <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels automatically evolve itself. Jaron worries correctly that any such approach would inevitably get stuck in some local minima. He also interestingly points out how <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> "missed the wheel." Actually, that's not entirely accurate. There are small wheel-like structures at the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> level, although it's true that their primary function is not for vehicle transportation. Wheels are not very useful, of course, without roads. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> did create a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that created wheels (and roads), so it did succeed in creating a lot of wheels, albeit indirectly (but there's nothing wrong with indirect methods, we use them in <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>).</p>
<p>With regard to creating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, we will integrate the insights and models gained from <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which will involve hundreds of regions, each with different methods, many of which do involve self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s at different levels. The feasibility of this <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> project and of implementing the revealed methods has already been clearly demonstrated. I don't have room in this response to describe the methodology and status of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> in detail, but I will point out that the concept is not necessarily limited to neuromorphic modeling of each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. We can model substantial neural clusters by implementing parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s that are functionally equivalent. This often results in substantially reduced <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al requirements, which has been shown by <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a>.</p>
<p>Jaron writes that "if there ever was a complex, chaotic phenomenon, we are it." I agree with that, but don't see this as an obstacle. My own area of interest is chaotic computing, which is how we do <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, which in turn is the heart of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">Chaos</a> is part of the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, it drives the process, and there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that we cannot harness these methods in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s just as they are utilized in our brains.</p>
<p>Jaron writes that "<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has evolved, introducing <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a>, for instance, but <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has never found a way to be any speed but very slow." But he is ignoring the essential <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process, which is that it accelerates because each stage introduces more powerful methods for creating the next stage. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> started out extremely slow, and the first halting steps took billions of years. The design of the principal body plans was faster, requiring only tens of millions of years. The process of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has accelerated, with each stage faster than the stage before it. Later key steps, such as the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">homo sapiens</a>, took only hundreds of thousands of years. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> continued indirectly (created by a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> created by <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>), continued this acceleration. The first steps took tens of thousands of years, outpacing <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, and has accelerated from there. The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> emerged in only a few years, distinctly faster than, say, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion.</p>
<p>Jaron complains that "surprisingly few of the most essential <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s have overheads that scale at a merely linear rate." Without taking up several pages to analyze this statement in detail, I will point out that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does what it does in its own real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, using interneuronal connections (where most of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> takes place) that operate at least ten million times slower than contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s. We can observe the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s massively parallel methods in detail, ultimately scan and understand all of its tens of trillions of connections, and replicate its methods. As I've mentioned, we're well down that path.</p>
<p>To correct a few of Jaron's statements regarding (my) <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> frames, it's not my position that the "<a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>" will "arrive a quarter of the way into the new century" or that a "new criticality" will be "achieved in the about the year 2020." Just so that the record is straight, my view is that we will have the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> capability to emulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> in a $1,000 of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> (which won't be organized in the rectangular forms we see today such as notebooks and palmtops, but rather embedded in our environment) by 2020. The <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> will take longer, to around 2030. The "<a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>" has divergent definitions, but for our purposes here we can consider this to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> dominate purely <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> forms, albeit being derivative of them. This takes us beyond 2030, to perhaps 2040 or 2050.</p>
<p>Jaron calls this an "immanent doom" and "an eschatological cataclysm," as if it were clear on its face that such a development were undesirable. I view these developments as simply the continuation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process and neither <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">utopian</a> nor <a class="thought" href="entries/dystopian_entry.html">dystopian</a>. It's true, on the one hand, that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>, and particularly the two together, have the potential to solve age-old problems of poverty and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> suffering, not to mention clean up the messes we're creating today with some of our more primitive technologies. On the other hand, there will be profound new problems and dangers that will emerge as well. I have always considered <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to be a double-edged sword. It amplifies both our creative and destructive <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>s, and we don't have to look further than today to see that.</p>
<p>However, on balance, I view the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> as a good thing, indeed as a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual direction. What we see in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion toward greater <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, greater <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, greater <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>, greater subtlety (i.e., the emergence of entities with <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> such as the ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, therefore greater <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>). And "<a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>" has been described as an ideal of an infinite level of these same <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>, even in its <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, never reaches infinite levels, but it's moving rapidly in that direction. So we could say that this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process is moving in a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual direction.</p>
<p>However, the story of the twenty-first century has not yet been written. So it's not my view that any particular story is inevitable, only that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, which has been inherently accelerating since the dawn of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, will continue its exponential pace.</p>
<p>Jaron writes that "the whole enterprise of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> is based on an intellectual mistake." Until such <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s at least match <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in every dimension, it will always remain possible for skeptics to say the glass is half empty. Every new achievement of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> can be dismissed by pointing out yet other goals have not yet been accomplished. Indeed, this is the frustration of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> practitioner, that once an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> goal is achieved, it is no longer considered <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> and becomes just a useful technique. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is inherently the <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of problems we have not yet solved.</p>
<p>Yet <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are indeed growing in <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and the range of tasks that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can accomplish that previously required intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> attention is rapidly growing. There are hundreds of examples of narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> today (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s evaluating electrocardiograms and blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> images, making medical diagnoses, guiding cruise missiles, making financial investment decisions, not to mention intelligently routing emails and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone connections), and the domains are becoming broader. Until such <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that the entire range of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intellectual capability is emulated, it will always be possible to minimize what <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are capable of doing.</p>
<p>I will point out that once we have achieved complete models of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be capable of combining the flexible, subtle, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> with the natural advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can instantly share <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, whereas we don't have quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports on our interconnection and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentration level patterns. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s are much faster (as I mentioned contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s is already ten million times faster than the electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing used in our brains) and have much more prodigious and accurate memories.</p>
<p>Jaron refers to the annual "<a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>" that Loebner runs, and maintains that "we have caused the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> to be passed." These are misconceptions. I used to be on the prize committee of this contest until a political conflict caused most of the prize committee members to quit. Be that as it may, this contest is not really a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, as we're not yet at that stage. It's a "narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>" which deals with domain-specific dialogues, not unrestricted dialog as Turing envisioned it. With regard to the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> as Turing described it, it is generally accepted that this has not yet happened.</p>
<p>Returning to Jaron's nice phrase "circle of empathy," he writes that his "personal choice is to not place <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s inside the circle." But would he put <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s inside that circle? We've already shown that a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> or even a substantial cluster of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s can be emulated in great detail and accuracy by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. So where on that slippery slope does Jaron find a stable footing? As <a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a> says in his September 25, 2000 commentary on Jaron's Half of a Manifesto, Jaron "turns out to be a closet Searlean." He just assumes that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> cannot be as subtle -- or as conscious -- as the hundreds of neural regions we call the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Like Searle, Jaron just assumes his conclusion. (For a more complete discussion of Searle and his theories, see my essay "Locked in his <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>, Response to <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a>" in the forthcoming book <u>Are We <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s?: </u><u>Ray Kurzweil</u><u> vs. the Critics of </u><u><a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">Strong AI</a></u>, Discovery Institute Press, 2001. This entire book will be posted on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613231359/http://www.kurzweilai.net/" target="_new">http://www.KurzweilAI.net</a>).</p>
<p>Near the end of Jaron's essay, he worries about the "terrifying" possibility that through these technologies the rich may obtain certain opportunities that the rest of humankind does not have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to. This, of course, would be nothing new, but I would point out that because of the ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a>, all of these technologies quickly become so inexpensive as to become almost free. Look at the extraordinary amount of high-quality <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> available at no cost on the web today which did not exist at all just a few years ago. And if one wants to point out that only a small fraction of the world today has Web <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, keep in mind that the explosion of the Web is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>At the end of his Half of a Manifesto, Jaron writes that "the ideology of cybernetic totalist intellectuals [may] be amplified from novelty into a force that could cause suffering for millions of people." I don't believe this fearful conclusion follows from Jaron's half of an argument. The bottom line is that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is power and this power is rapidly increasing. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> may result in suffering or liberation, and we've certainly seen both in the twentieth century. I would argue that we've seen more of the latter, but nevertheless neither Jaron nor I wish to see the amplification of destructiveness that we have witnessed in the past one hundred years. As I mentioned above, the story of the twenty first century has not yet been written. I think Jaron would agree with me that our destiny is in our hands. However, I regard "our hands" to include our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which is properly part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/lanier_entry.html">Jaron Lanier</a>'s "One Half of a Manifesto" was originally published September 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613231359/http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge74.html" target="_new">Edge</a>.</p>

EMPIRICALLY: I was paying ATTENTION to getting away from the tiger, so I was not AWARE of the PAIN that should have told me he was able to scratch my leg with his two inch claws. Once I was out of danger, I was CONSCIOUS of the PAIN I FELT. When I went to the doctor, he gave me some ether so I wouldn't feel the pain while he put in the sutures. After I WOKE UP, it still hurt a little bit.
<br>
<br>
The above narrative is completely consistent with nearly everyone's experience of awareness, consciousness and pain. Are you here to deny ever having a similar experience of cuts, sprains or bruises during spirited play, only later to realise you sustained damage?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You haven't demonstrated anything, you just keep repeating your assertion. Just becase *you* can't imagine pain without consciousness, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Perhaps, for example, in a non-human life form. You haven't proven anything, you have just stated  that it's beyond the limits of your imagination. 
<br>
<br>
I suggest you read Kant, Hegel, Nietzche, Sartre, Whitehead, Wittgenstein. There is very little discussion of pain in their considerable discussions of consciousness, the exceptions being Nietzche and Wittgenstein. Nietzsche theorizes that consciousness arose through the *avoidance* of pain (and so would predate consciousness), while Wittgenstein's discussions of pain are marginal and aimed at showing that there's no need to postulate the existens of mind *at all*.
<br>
<br>
Michio Kaku, one of  the world's leading physicists, surveyed 150 of the world's leading scientists for his book "Visions: How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st Century." On page 9 he states that the nature of consciousness remains a mystery.

Just one DEFINITION commonly accepted of what consciousness is.

Is this addressed to a Straw Man? I agree with this. I said I can't FEEL pain unless I am aware of it. Nowhere did I say I had the exclusive priveledge of being conscious, either by solopsism or by my humanity. I do not require self-awareness to feel pain. Infants, who won't become self-aware for about three years, feel pain unless they are asleep. Who would deny that? I've seen animals suffer and believe them to be aware of their own suffering. Most veteranarians share this belief.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Good point about the infants. At such an early stage of development, I think, humans are much closer to animals than "people". I hope people try to see what I mean by that and don't take it off on a argumentative tangent. What's important though is that they must have some form on consciousness, however basic, perhaps not enough to be called self awareness, to "feel" pain. Otherwise their reactions are just responses of the nervous system that have evolved to protect them, mostly by illiciting protective responses from their parents. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Looks like your really struggling here. That's your argument? You aren't making any claims but it is possible to imagine pain can exist without consciousness and we can't prove otherwise? What's your point Descartes? For all practical purposes it is proven that pain can't exist without consciousness because as we've shown, consciousness is inherent to the definition of pain. If "pain" does exist somewhere without consciousness then there is no will for it stop which means IT ISN'T PAIN. Name as many philosophers as you want, that's a PAINfully easy concept to grasp and I haven't seen you begin to argue otherwise.</p></td>

Actually this is a perfect example of Lanier's point that technology often made user-unfriendly in the service of some arbitrary techo-ideology.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Funny post...I hope that's how you intented it and that you actually are capable of reading a paragraph with the occasional orange-lettered word. In response to your post on animal rights the obvious point is that pain is not pain at all if it isn't consciously felt. If your leg was amputated and then punctured with pins we wouldn't worry about the pain the poor leg was suffering. When we're under anesthesia, pain signals may be sent but we don't feel them. This is, of course, not the same thing as the experiences of animals...and then perhaps it is. If they are simple, organic machines who respond to negative stimuli as their instinct programs, they don't actually feel pain at all. I don't believe that. I think that many animals are conscious enough to experience pain the way we do.

And some words, such as "technology" often appear numerous times in a single paragraph.  What purpose does that serve, other than to remind us that a computer is amking the decisions without the aid of human intelligence?  I suggest that whoever makes the decisions in these things change the color of the highlight and that a line in the decision-making code be included to only highlight the same word once per paragraph, or maybe even once per article.

That opens up another possibility in the "Will the singularity be bad for humans?" debate -- for some it will be miserable, others won't notice.

This proves my point -- you guys have become so desensitized to bad UI design, you wouldn't know a good one if it came up and smacked you in the face. Heaven help us if you are *designing* them! (or does anyone bother to do that any more?)

One of my best teachers said, "It's alright to have 'cute', as long as you give the user a way to turn off the 'cute'." 
<br>
<br>
So back to my original question: How do I turn off the 'cute'?

I guess "It takes a village" to correct a minor, 101-type UI bug. Seeing as how this site is supposed to be so "cutting edge", this doesn't speak all that highly for the future of AI, or AS (Artificial Stupidity) as I prefer to call it.

I notice they also fixed the 42x42 banner, ditto without saying anything, and pretending that the problem never existed in the first place.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Modern science has progressed tremendously in the last few decades. It has, sort of, transformed the life of every person on the earth. It has invented numerous objects of comfort and convenience. In fact, artificial intelligence is invented in the forms of computers and digital machines. Science has, however, not bothered to see for whom these facilities are created. Everybody, collectively, assuming that "I" is real and the external means to satisfy and comfort the body can make mankind happy. They are, however, not inclined to investigate if there is really somebody in the body to enjoy the materials. In fact, they are not ready to look beyond the physical body.
<br>
<br>
Human brain, under various social and cultural influences, loses its natural abilities and instincts. It dwells in the slavery of words, thoughts, memories, and logic and thrives on the illusory existence of ego or "I". This is the basic problem of human life; lest we are even able to identify this problem. We have learned that the pseudo image of "I" gives birth to contemplative factors such as religion, cast, sect, society, nation etc. Due to these worldly attachments, emotions like hate, jealousy and animosity erupt and cause wars, riots, terrorism and alike. The human body, in the context, loses its natural sensations and inhabits various ailments and deficiencies. 
<br>
<br>
The Inner World
<br>
<br>
One hundred and eighty million muscles and veins in the body are under continuous influence of the thought waves. Since the thoughts are usually conflicting in nature (uncertainty, yes, no etc.), the body cells undergo the same duress. Naturally, each cell of the body should work in consonance with each other for healthy existence. However, due to imposed conflicts, they tend to work against each other and send paradoxical signals to the brain. That is how so many thoughts erupt at one time in the mind. As a result, brain cells and nerves always remain tense and the brain is unable to deal with the whole body at one time. The body, thus, becomes less sensitive and starts weakening. Over a period of time, the body completely wears away to what we call death. 
<br>
<br>
In comparison, other creatures in Nature, live in much more harmony since they do not have the thought process such as ours. They have healthy bodies and do not require doctors. Their mind and body cells are in complete equilibrium and they are very much part of the ever flowing Nature. 
<br>
<br>
One drop of dew makes the grass to bend. The brain cells, which are hundred times lighter than grass are continuously weighted under millions of thoughts. Besides, it has to bear the burden of something, which is not there. We are talking about the illusory existence of mind and "I" which induces an additional weight on the brain cells. With "I" comes the supplementary afflictions such as social, cultural, emotional and financial factors. Moreover, it has to perform superfluous tasks of controlling the feelings of hate, love, animosity, friendship and many more. It has to also maintain the pseudo image of "I" and make the false thoughts appear as reality. Thus, the added burden of religion, family, duty, ambition etc. 
<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is that beside all these needless activities, the brain has to take care of natural body functions like breathing, blood circulation, digestion, defecation and immune system. All these activities are incessant and the brain is therefore performing dual tasks. That has affected its longitivity and as the consequence, the human life has become shorter. Even today, people living away from modern civilization have longer life span than rest of the world. Life is Nature's gift and humans have no right to corrupt and reduce it by senseless means. The mind makes us think that thinking and practical life is necessary for survival. Ignorant of the truth and giving in to the mechanical process of mind, humans have been unknowingly and constantly leading a suicidal life. Humans have created Gods, demi-Gods, Scriptures and scientific means in an attempt to make the life peaceful and happy. Yet, nobody seems to be happy regardless of one's social or professional status. The other creatures in Nature, however, do not think and therefore do not need such flimsy aids to live a happy and natural life. 
<br>
<br>
An Illusion called "I"
<br>
<br>
Nobody has the insight to observe that "I" is merely a hallucination. It does not exist in truth. Since our thoughts are influenced by past lives, the strong feeling of "I" is inherited by all the human beings. We are born with desires, memories and delusions of numerous past lives. We have been genetically conditioned to believe that "I" is real. Since our thoughts are always influenced by this fallacy, it is not possible to achieve liberation by "thinking". We have to first acknowledge that we are caught. If we continue to live the way we are, how will the illusion end? "I" is imaginary and how can one satisfy something that does not exist? We have only known the unnatural side of life and have not actually realized the existence of the natural and real one. That is how we do not see the web. To be able to see it, we need a thoughtless mind and awareness. 
<br>
<br>
We shall also have to analyze the way science and scientists work. It seems that all their activities are based on the "thinking process". Whatever they invent is a creation of the mind. Though the inventions and creations cannot be termed as illusory, they seem to be only helping and satisfying the "I". 
<br>
<br>
Modern Perspective
<br>
<br>
A mind caught in the imaginary world of "I" will keep on making instruments that will only support the illusion. If the scientists can be made aware of this deceit and if they work in harmony with Nature, the whole mankind can be benefited. We are all living in a dream and accept it as a reality. The scientists are no exception. They are as human as we all are. Whatever intellect and genius they have, they are also caught in the web of  thoughts and ego. Anything coming out of such a mind will only be a manifestation of "I" or the illusion. The world will seem to be progressing and advancing but the basic problem of "I" will always remain same. If we do not know who is there in the body to enjoy all the perceived success, nothing can  be achieved. 
<br>
<br>
Science, today, has an authority over ancient scriptures. It has proven them wrong in many ways. Science has come a long way from the first telescope to nuclear physics. Einstein gave the theory of relativity, which has revolutionized quantum physics. The contribution of Newton is equally commendable. Together with the laws of motion, gravity and relativity, modern science is reaching out to explore the Universe. On the other side, quantum physics, has helped dissecting  matter and understanding the power of energy in the nucleus. In spite of these discoveries, scientists have not been able to completely break up the atom. They have been able to discover that something is there but they do not know why. They know that the Amino Acids are building blocks of human life but cannot understand the DNA and its molecular patterns. Of late, genetic research has also started but again science will only able to know "what is there" but not "why it is there". With millions of words available, they are not able to name a lot many natural phenomenons. 
<br>
<br>
This forces us to believe that still the knowledge is incomplete. We have daft physicists like Adington , who has said, "Some unknown power is controlling the world and we do not know how it works". It is very clear that we cannot find the truth through words. It can only be a natural basic mind, devoid of thoughts, that can be in oneness with Nature. The brain has the capacity to synchronize with Nature and control life through natural instincts. If humans can understand the truth and come out of the slavery of thoughts and "I", they can lead a very intrinsic, peaceful and happy life.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This is full of the usual inconsistencies of the strong AI argument and nothing new has been said.
<br>
<br>
(i)That consciousness is a subjective pheonomena doesn't make it less of an OBJECTIVE fact. Subjective phenomena are just an objective fact of the usinverse. 
<br>
<br>
(ii) ALl knowledge is based upon belief of some sort : no absolute proof of atoms exists, but an overwhelming body of corroborative data supports the notion of the atom as an integral part of the universe : but this is not the same as a mathematical truth, and requires on our part a belief in the processes that support the theory of atoms.
<br>
 The same is true of consciousness and subjective phenomena : there is no OBJECTIVE current method of measuring them scientifically, but it is totaly fraudulent to then argue they dont't actually exist , just because they can't be measured. In fact, it is phlosophically totally inconsistent to be a conscious being , to believe in the existence of other beings like yourself, and then to assume that you're the only conscious one among them. This is clearly nonsense. If you believe in a philosophical set of values that upholds the idea of an external world in which other similar beings inhabit, then belief in the scientific method and the exisetnce of other people's subjective phenomena are not just not antagonistic, as is frequently suggested, they are REQUIRED partners
<br>
<br>
(iii) The point about animal consciousness  is always interesting . Clearly some dogs feel pain and undergo dramatic emotional changes of state. But clearly they don't make great arithmetic calculators and don't write too many great books. The notion of writing a "Dog Iq" program , absurd as it is, rarely gets mentioned : nor that of an 'ant' Iq, an 'elephant' IQ or a 'mouise' IQ,as there is aummed to be some genetic switch to a hardware-software platform at some point on the evolutionary cycle and the human brain goes into some unspecified compuational state. The net result apepar to have to be that all animals are assumed to be only quasi-mental simply because they can't add up and be 'computational'. Yet there is every reason to assume that a great deal of other animals have consciousness : they display emotions and respond to sesnory stimuli inmuch the same way as us.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;In comparison, other creatures in Nature, live in much more harmony since they do not have the thought process such as ours. They have healthy bodies and do not require doctors. Their mind and body cells are in complete equilibrium and they are very much part of the ever flowing Nature. 
<br>
<br>
For all their harmony with nature, I notice that very few of them live as long as we do.  They do get sick (as sick as a dog?) and when they become pets they constantly have to be looked after or they will die.  When I think of the hamsters and rebbits my children have killed with neglect and the diseases that have ravaged the bird population in this area, I have to wonder about the usefulness of all this harmony with nature.  Even plants are subject to disease, with mighty oak trees succumbing to tiny moths and various kinds of fungi.  
<br>
<br>
Nature's way of doing things is to kill off what can't adapt and it doesn't take much.  Coral reefs in Australia and the Far East are dying because they can't adjust to a change in the ocean temperature.  The illusion of the harmony of nature is just that -- an illusion.  In reality, there is always something looking to take the place of those that aren't stronger than the rest.</p></td>
