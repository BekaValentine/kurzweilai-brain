<div class="TeaserText">We're entering an age of acceleration. The models underlying society at every level, which are largely based on a linear model of change, are going to have to be redefined. Because of the explosive power of exponential growth, the 21st century will be equivalent to 20,000 years of progress at today's rate of progress; organizations have to be able to redefine themselves at a faster and faster pace.</div>

<p><b>Meyer:</b> The accelerating rate of change makes it difficult 
              to stay innovative, especially because processes that worked in 
              the past are becoming less and less effective. Why do you think 
              traditional ways of inventing new products no longer work?</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> Most projects fail, not because the R&amp;D department 
              can&#8217;t get it to work, but because the timing is wrong. Probably 
              more often than not these days, projects are premature. All the 
              enabling forces aren&#8217;t in place yet. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613233726/http://www.cbi.cgey.com/journal/issue9/in_search.htm" target="_blank">But 
              it&#8217;s also not a good idea to just target today&#8217;s world, 
              because windows can be closed by the time you finish a project. 
              So you really have to catch the wave at just the right time.</a>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> has taught us a great deal about the accelerating 
              rate of change. What can we take away?</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a> is the acceleration 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of the products of an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. And this really goes back to the roots of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> works through indirection. You create something and then 
              work through that to create the next stage. And for that <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, 
              the next stage is more powerful, and happens more quickly. And that 
              has been accelerating ever since the dawn of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.</p>
<p>The first stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> took billions of years. <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> was being 
              created and that was very significant because it was like a little 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> to store the results 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s, and to build up a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> from which it could 
              then launch <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s and codify the results. </p>
<p>The subsequent stages of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> happened much more quickly. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> Explosion only took a few tens of millions of years 
              to establish the body plan to evolve <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. And we see that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
              like certain technologies, has become mature and stopped evolving. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> has concentrated on other issues, specifically higher 
              cortical functions. And that happened much more quickly than the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> Explosion. <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">Humanoid</a>s evolved over many millions of years, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> over only hundreds of thousands of years. And there 
              again, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> used the products of its <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary processes, 
              which was <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a>, to create the next stage, which was <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-directed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which really is a continuation of the cutting-edge of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>, for creating more intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>In the first stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-directed <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it took tens of 
              thousands of years, which is what you would expect for the next 
              stage via the wheel, or stone tools, and that kept accelerating, 
              because when we had stone tools, we could use them to build the 
              next stage. So a thousand years ago a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> only took a 
              century, like the printing press. And now a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>, like 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a>, is measured in only a few years&#8217; <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. 
              The first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were built with screwdrivers and were designed 
              with pencil and paper, and today we use <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to create <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_aided_design_entry.html">CAD</a> designer will sit down and specify a few high-level <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s, 
              and 12 different layers of automated designs will be done automatically. 
              The most significant acceleration is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rate 
              itself, which I think of as the rate of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. And 
              all of these are actually not exponential, but double exponentials 
              because not only does the process accelerate because of our <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>&#8217;s 
              ability to use each stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to build the next stage, 
              but also, as the process, as an area gets higher price performance, 
              more resources get drawn into that capability. </p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> As you&#8217;ve pointed out, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>&#8217;s rate 
              of change continues to get faster and faster. If change is exponential, 
              what will that mean for our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> The whole 20th century, because we&#8217;ve been 
              speeding up to this point, is equivalent to 20 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              at today&#8217;s rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, and we&#8217;ll make another 20 
              years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today&#8217;s rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> equal to the 
              whole 20th century in the next 14 years, and then we&#8217;ll do 
              it again in seven years. And because of the explosive power of exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, the 21st century will be equivalent to 20,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              at today&#8217;s rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, which is a thousand times greater 
              than the 20th century, which was no slouch to change. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> What examples of accelerating change do we see in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> now? Are we responding in the right way to prepare for the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> We are still <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> fashion. We&#8217;ve 
              extended out Social Security from 32 years to 39 years. Well, obviously 
              there is some old model underlying that. We don&#8217;t absolutely 
              know what the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will bring, and if you look at the models, 
              they&#8217;re absolutely <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>. We don&#8217;t take into account 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>, which is absolutely a factor. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>If you look at the economy as a whole, either per capita or just 
              the total economy, it is growing exponentially. But the various 
              recessions, even the Great Depression, are relatively minor features 
              that you really see in this chart that is a big exponential. And 
              what&#8217;s interesting is that when the recession is over, including 
              the Great Depression, it starts back to where it would have been 
              had that never occurred in the first place. It does not represent 
              even a permanent slowing down or delay in the underlying exponential. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>The really pervasive phenomena is the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. We have 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a>. Even that is understated because 
              we&#8217;re measuring the value in dollars of what can be accomplished. 
              But what can be accomplished for a dollar today is far greater than 
              what could be accomplished for a dollar 10 years ago. <br>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a> is not the only <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that is growing exponentially. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, speed and price performance&#8212;both 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> and wired&#8212;are also doubling every year. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> 
              technologies, the price performance of base pair scanning, for example, 
              have doubled every year. </p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> How has the accelerating rate of technological change 
              affected <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> as a whole?</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> <a href="insights.htm">Even with today&#8217;s 
              technology, which is going to evolve further very rapidly, the opportunity 
              for ideas to find the right people who are going to push them forward 
              and to get the right ideas in the right places is really extraordinary, 
              and a great facilitator of progress.</a> And it&#8217;s a very liberating 
              and democratizing force as well, and I think it&#8217;s really behind 
              the trend toward democracy. It might seem like we&#8217;re moving 
              toward democracy, but if you really look at the world compared to, 
              say, 1990, there has been a tremendous movement in every area of 
              the world. And not just at a sort of national political level, but 
              at every level of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> What traditionally expensive items will be commodities 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> as <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> enables <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> Well principally, business is more and more concerned 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. And you know, we talk about an age 
              where <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is fully in the mainstream, which is probably 
              the 2020s. We can just convert <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into any product. But 
              we&#8217;re not that far from that today. <br>
</p>
<p>Look at modern factories. It&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that secures the materials 
              at the lowest possible cost and arranges for their just-in-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              delivery, and then routes them and sends them on their way. And 
              there are only a few people in the factory. You really have a conversion 
              of inexpensive raw materials, very efficiently secured and routed 
              and shipped and shaped by <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> into high-quality products. So 
              we&#8217;re not that far from an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_economy_entry.html">information economy</a> today. <br>
</p>
<p><a href="boyle.htm">The value in today&#8217;s economy is principally 
              knowledge and information, whether information is a movie, music, 
              or a piece of software, or some inventory control database. </a>This 
              trend will continue in an exponential way. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> 
              will be measured in bytes stored in <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s, or <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s filed, 
              or whatever level you want to look at, and it is also growing exponentially. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>The opportunity to have different kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> will have value. I think there are forces in both 
              directions on things like land. Because on the one hand, while we 
              could say that other types of products can expand without limit, 
              we&#8217;re always going to have only a certain amount of land. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> How will our lives change? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> These new technologies are going to allow people 
              to spread out, and we won&#8217;t have the concentrated demands like 
              we see in downtown Manhattan because people will be able to live 
              anywhere they want, without sacrificing efficiency. Once you get 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> going, people can have any kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> they 
              want anywhere. This is a force that would make land less valuable. 
              You don&#8217;t have to be in any particular physical <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> How can you plan for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of your business 
              in such an age of unpredictability? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> Well, it&#8217;s an ongoing movement. We&#8217;re 
              entering an age of acceleration. While acceleration was there 500 
              years ago, it was at that point of an exponential where it looked 
              like a flat, horizontal line. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the rate of change 
              was really disrupted, at least one of the early harbingers of that, 
              was with the weavers in the English textile industry, who had had 
              a weaving guild that had been passed down for centuries through 
              their families. The new textile <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that suddenly emerged in 
              the first phase of the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a> destroyed the weavers&#8217; 
              livelihood. It seemed that employment would soon be a thing of the 
              past, and then they realized that it instead lead to prosperity, 
              and rather than making the same <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of shirts with fewer people, 
              they could make a whole wardrobe of shirts. The common man and woman 
              could have well-made clothing, and then the prosperity led to the 
              different types of pursuits, and leisure <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and industries to 
              create the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, and so on. <br>
</p>
<p>But from that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on, the idea that the &#8220;times they are a 
              changing&#8221; became evident. You no longer expect your grandchildren 
              to live the same lives that you did, and your lives are very different 
              from your parents&#8217; lives. <br>
</p>
<p>Today there&#8217;s an axiom that the only constant is change. But 
              what people don&#8217;t recognize is that the world itself has changed 
              because the greater change is accelerating. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613233726/http://www.cbi.cgey.com/journal/issue9/nerve.htm" target="_blank">So 
              our whole concept of what it means to be human is going to be changing, 
              and it is going to be merging with our technology. </a><br>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> So, must we live with a new mindset, particularly 
              as we try to create new business models? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>-based innovation these days requires 
              collaboration between different disciplines. This is because innovation 
              today typically involves interdisciplinary work. So one thing that 
              you need is experts in each of those areas. </p>
<p>Second, it&#8217;s also possible for people to anticipate change 
              too rapidly. The last booms we've seen have been an example of that. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> by the stock market that the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> was a profound 
              revolution was absolutely correct&#8212;and the same thing for <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>&#8212;but 
              that doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t a pace for that, and 
              it doesn&#8217;t mean that every business model that&#8217;s different 
              from the past is going to succeed. The investment got ahead of itself, 
              and people were willing to invest in unproven ideas. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Meyer:</b> What will happen to organizational <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycles in 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of accelerating change? <br>
</p>
<p><b>Kurzweil:</b> There are more challenges to organizational lifetimes, 
              in that an organization cannot be devoted to one business model. 
              And the models we have underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> at every level are going 
              to be challenged, whether you&#8217;re talking about the role of 
              schools, or religious institutions, or business in general. All 
              of these models are going to have to be redefined. A particular 
              business model, General Motors&#8217; that&#8217;s selling cars, or 
              U.S. Steel&#8217;s that&#8217;s selling steel, will have a lifetime. 
              Some of them have lasted decades, but in keeping with the law of 
              accelerating returns, that part of the business model is going to 
              get shorter and shorter. And of course, we see in the heart of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              itself, already very rapid business models. <br>
</p>
<p>If you look at a company like <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>, and if you look at their 
              stock, it&#8217;s been pretty stable through this very difficult 
              stock market. Some people would say that their success is due simply 
              to the fact that they have the so-called monopoly in <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s. 
              I would point out that PCs are only one type of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. There 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>s, there are hand-held <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, there are game 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in cameras and in other specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> is involved in all of these areas, but does not dominate 
              any of them. Their success in my view is because they have a significant 
              ability to adapt. I think it comes from <a class="thought" href="entries/gates_entry.html">Bill Gates</a>&#8217; justified 
              concern, what he calls his "paranoia" about relying for 
              too long on any particular business model, but rather trying to 
              predict where <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and the industry are going.<br>
</p>
<p>So we see that a company can be stable if it&#8217;s committed to 
              a high level of quality of its personnel and their ability to anticipate 
              change, and relentlessly question every assumption about their business, 
              and develop <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically models of where every level of their 
              organization is going in the world ahead. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613233726/http://www.cbi.cgey.com/journal/issue9/insights.htm" target="_blank">Companies 
              need to be committed to innovation and really to measuring the duration 
              of their models.</a> What happens in these companies is that the 
              old-line business model has all of the political power because it 
              is producing the profits and the revenue. <br>
</p>
<p>An organization needs to be <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up to empower the people who disrupt 
              things from inside, but it has to be based on some disciplined <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology 
              of understanding some realistic model that incorporates an exponential 
              rate of change to understand realistically how long different models 
              will last, or how long specific assumptions will last. That doesn't 
              mean every disruption should be supported because some aren't 
              going to work. But organizations have to be able to redefine themselves 
              at a faster and faster pace.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The double exponentially growth of computing power combined with implementation of models obtained during reverse engineering of human brain will change the business for sure.
<br>
<br>
Imagine virtual experts, virtual programers, all companies could became virtual rducing the cost of operation.
<br>
<br>
Imagine that an entire company is virtual, so you could provide more processing pover (overclock the company) and the life cycles whould be shorter. Twice more computing power - twice shorter life cycles. This could be applicable to a software conpany of R&amp;D departament of any hardware company. 
<br>
<br>
With the appearence of nanotechnology the
<br>
difference betwen software and hardware will
<br>
disapper.
<br>
<br>
Indeed the difference between our reality and virtual reality will disappear. And we are going to treat virtual reality and our present reality as equal. Or even virtual reality will be prefered beacuse we could change the "lows of physics" in it, it is going to be more flexible.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>As beings caught in this tidal wave of change. personal survival/prosperity will come down to adaptbility and timming. We each have skills and faults of varing levels and can either choose to use them, exploit them, enhance, or change them as we see fit....... or not to, if thats your bag.
<br>
<br>
we need a better system of identifying these atributes as well as a way to enhance and/or change them as we desire. when space is no longer an issue, opertunity will come to those with the correct skill set at the correct moment.
<br>
<br>
the important point is adapability.  businesses as models have had the luxury of time up untill now to layout plans and employment structures. Changes to that plan have always been detrimental to those employed by the last structure and adventagious to those that fit the new model.
<br>
<br>
when entering this virtual business environment envisioned, employees must adapt as fast or close to the speed that the business model, which will be nearly in real time. Now in years past, this was often refered to as "on the fly". A term not very well regarded. But it will be a usable plan, sufficiently adaptable to the industry environment. you will no longer look for " a solid business plan", you will look for "a strong, flexible business plan".
<br>
<br>
one disturbing observation....
<br>
 Being forward thinking in this day and age is daunting because by the time you come up with an idea and are ready to implement it, you have to reform your idea at close to fundamental levels, practically starting from scratch. in the future, practice will change in the time it takes you to write it down the theory behind it. there will have to be faster ways to input and comunicate ideas, as well as recieve. *User interface will be the barrier that slows progress down.*
<br>
<br>
with the virtual world envisioned (the new interface?). having interdisplinary experts will be the resource businesses want. information is a resource and the more information you have the wealthier you are.  commoditizing information though stifles colabrative inovation. actually, greed, placing claim on a proprietary idea and selling to the highest bidder, and only the highest bidder, and only those you allow to bid, is what stifles colabrative inovation.
<br>
<br>
Money and value must be redifined. especially if it is a true wish to have prosperity for all and not just a small, insigificant ellite.
<br>
<br>
I pray those in front have that wish in mind.
<br>
<br>
<br>
but I got off track......  the expert disciplines now are Gurus, specific individuals with the correct skills and thinking (and currently the right age, educational background, living situation, etc.) for the task needed by the company/system. As AI grows more pervasive in society, the experts will not be individuals, they will be networks of collaborators connected through communication channels and their common interests. the experts will be "virtual", but based on the collaborative efforts of a network of individuals.
<br>
<br>
"The union of indepentant smart guys", a phrase coined by one of my more animated collaborators. we are a network of friends all with interests in computer technology ranging from coding to hardware sales. the power we have come accross is our adapibility to any professional problems one of us encounters. If I don't know the answer to the problem, I know who does and I'll go ask him...... now.   
<br>
-  adapability   -
<br>
<br>
Whats missing is  better communication and collaboration tools..... as well as a few more heads 8)... but both of those come with time. the point is the model is sound. We all work for our different employers, spanning the country and the corporate pyramid game. when one person moves a new channel is opened for opertunity of the group while the old channel may stay open to the network through customer satisfaction, growing the network in the process.
<br>
<br>
this system should be aplicable to most any displine, given enough customized communication and collaboration tools. the only barriers are personal agendas and conflicts, but those are only signs of incompatible ideals which would be remedied by having more established networks.
<br>
<br>
I've spewed too much about my own projects and ideals but now seemed a good time to share. plus I need help. this is the start of My business model that I hope to have in place in 20 some odd years (and boy will they be odd 8) ).  I think I'm on the right track. anyone else agree?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The pace of accelleration is indeed evident in scientific discovery and in our everyday economic lives, and as I start middle age, raises some ambivalence in feelings and thoughts:
<br>
<br>
While viewing the evolutionary model from a layman's viewpoint, some underlying laws emerge:
<br>
<br>
Evolution is more efficient when the generational cycle is shortened.
<br>
<br>
Every generation's progress and output is optimized when the previous generation gets itself out of the way as soon as the new one is capable of reproducing.
<br>
<br>
Most scientists are reported to do their best work in their twenties and early thirties.
<br>
<br>
The design of our bodies seem to bear this out, as cellular ageing after 40 is anything but linear for the average person.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, as I age I seem to understand many non-practical things better, but have a tough time learning new (saleable) skills.
<br>
<br>
If you detect a hint of self-pity in this scribe, you are correct.  But then, what exactly is self-pity?  Is it at its root a cry that perhaps I have not given as much as I can to the next generation to build on?  Is every insight not another potentially usefull brick to be built on?
<br>
<br>
Which brings me to the centerpiece of my treatise: Do we have any hope of matching our  emotional, spiritual and philosophical rate of evolution to the technological or will those human traits eventually be crowded entirely?
<br>
<br>
Are the cognicenti that are at the edge of all the new developments, for that moment, more machine than human?
<br>
<br>
What is the underlying motivation that so drives people to excell?  Is it survival?  Does the receipt of a Nobel or Fields Prize enhance your survivability, or that of your offspring?  Or does it simply say that you should have selected your procreational mate(s) carefully so as to ensure the highest indices of quantity, quality and diversity in your spawn? 
<br>
<br>
I believe there are incredible sociological forces at work, largely in our subconscious minds, that are at the heart of these drives and motivations.
<br>
<br>
Some of the articles that I have read in this forum seem to touch on these largely hidden forces at times, but it is as if they wish to remain hidden for the most part.
<br>
<br>
The search for understanding continous.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Accelerating change: Some Thoughts
<br>
<br>
Everything that you take for granted as being a "normal" way of life will be taken away suddenly. It's that simple. This is true if the change is a positive one for humanity, or a negative one.
<br>
<br>
Technology concentrates power. This concentration is also growing exponentially. The concentration is not only in terms of raw energy, but also in terms of reducing the amount of people required to wield such power. 9/11 is a cold, raw example of this fact. With accelerating change, we can expect more horrific incidents, each one more alien, more mind-bending and more destructive than the last. The tempo of these technological catastrophes will accelerate: likely, there will be a few more before this decade is done, and many before 2020. Sometimes these will be deliberately caused by people, and sometimes they will be "accidents."
<br>
<br>
Chemical and bioweapons are generally over-rated. They're more "weapons of mass terror" than destruction. Nuclear weapons are pretty much the only WMD in existence today (compare, say, the results of the nerve gas attack in that Japanese subway, or the anthrax mailings in the U.S., with the results of the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki--it 's pretty clear what has the "mass destruction" capability). There's still enough nuclear warheads in various stockpiles to effectively shut down civilization. With a nuclear war, the exponential growth trends would be done, at least for awhile, if not permanently.
<br>
<br>
Nothing's for certain. The double-edge sword that technology represents could very well terminate superintelligence just as it is about to emerge. There's a proverb that goes something to the effect: "shit happens."</p></td>
