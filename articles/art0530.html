<div class="TeaserText">The amount of information you could process if you were to use all the energy and matter of the universe is 10^90 bits and the number of elementary operations that it can have performed since the Big Bang is about 10^120 ops. Perhaps the universe is itself a computer and what it's doing is performing a computation. If so, that's why the universe is so complex and these numbers say how big that computation is. Also, that means Douglas Adams was right (the answer is "42").</div>

<p>I'm a professor of mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering at MIT. I build quantum 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that store <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> atoms and then massage 
              the normal interactions between the atoms to make them compute. 
              Rather than having the atoms do what they normally do, you make 
              them do <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s like <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> flips, not <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s, 
              and-gates, and or-gates. This allows you to process <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              not only on a small scale, but in ways that are not possible using 
              ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to figure out how to make atoms compute, 
              you have to learn how to speak their <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and to understand 
              how they process <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> under normal circumstances. </p>
<p>It's been known for more than a hundred years, ever since Maxwell, 
              that all physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s register and process <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. For 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, this little inchworm right here has something on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              of Avogadro's <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of atoms. And dividing by Boltzmann's <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>, 
              its <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> is on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of Avogadro's <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of bits. This means 
              that it would take about Avogadro's <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of bits to describe that 
              little guy and how every <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> is jiggling around in 
              his body in full detail. Every physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> registers <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              and just by evolving in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, by doing its thing, it changes that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, transforms that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, or, if you like, processes 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Since I've been building quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s I've 
              come around to <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the world in terms of how it processes 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a paper in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> called "Fundamental 
              Physical Limits to <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>," in which I showed that you 
              could rate the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing power of physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. 
              Say that you're building a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> out of some collection of atoms. 
              How many logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s per second could you perform? Also, 
              how much <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> could these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s register? Using relatively 
              straightforward techniques you can show, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, that the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s per second that you can 
              perform with that amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, E, is just E/H - well, it's 
              2E divided by <a class="thought" href="entries/pi_entry.html">pi</a> times h-bar. [h-bar is essentially 10[-34] (10 
              to the -34) Joule-seconds, meaning that you can perform 10[-50] 
              (10 to the 50) ops per second.)]If you have a kilogram of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, 
              which has mc2 - or around 10[17] Joules (10 to the 17) Joules - 
              worth of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and you ask how many ops per second it could perform, 
              it could perform 10[17] (ten to the 17) Joules / h-bar. It would 
              be really spanking if you could have a kilogram of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> - about 
              what a laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> weighs - that could process at this rate. 
              Using all the conventional techniques that were developed by Maxwell, 
              Boltzmann, and Gibbs, and then developed by von Neumann and others 
              back at the early part of the 20th century for counting <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s 
              of states, you can count how many bits it could register. What you 
              find is that if you were to turn the thing into a nuclear fireball 
              - which is essentially turning it all into radiation, probably the 
              best way of having as many bits as possible - then you could register 
              about 10[30] (10 to the 30) bits. Actually that's many more bits 
              than you could register if you just stored a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> on every <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, 
              because Avogadro's <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of atoms store about 10[24] (10 to the 
              24) bits.</p>
<p>Having done this paper to calculate the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the ultimate 
              laptop, and also to raise some speculations about the role of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing 
              in, for example, things like <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s, I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that this was 
              actually too modest a venture, and that it would be worthwhile to 
              calculate how much <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> you could process if you were to 
              use all the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. This came up because 
              back in when I was doing a Masters in <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> at Cambridge. 
              I studied with <a class="thought" href="entries/hawking_entry.html">Stephen Hawking</a> and people like that, and I had an 
              old <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> text. I realized that I can estimate the amount of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that's available in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and I know that if I look 
              in this book it will tell me how to count the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of bits that 
              could be registered, so I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> I would look and see. If you wanted 
              to build the most powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> you could, you can't do better 
              than including everything in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that's potentially available. 
              In particular, if you want to know when <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, this fantastic 
              exponential doubling of the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s every couple of years, 
              must end, it would have to be before every single piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is used to perform a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Actually, 
              just to telegraph the answer, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> has to end in about 600 
              years, without doubt. Sadly, by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> will 
              be running <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> 2540, or something like that. 99.99% of the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> will have been listed by <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> by that point, 
              and they'll want more! They really will have to start writing efficient 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, by gum. They can't rely on <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> to save their butts 
              any longer.</p>
<p>I did this calculation, which was relatively simple. You take, 
              first of all, the observed density of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, which 
              is roughly one <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> per cubic meter. The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is about 
              thirteen billion years old, and using the fact that there are <a class="thought" href="entries/pi_entry.html">pi</a> 
              times 10[7] (10 to the 7) seconds in a year, you can calculate the 
              total <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that's available in the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Remembering 
              that there's a certain amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, you then divide by Planck's 
              Constant - which tells you how many ops per second can be performed 
              - and multiply by the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and you get the total 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s that could have been performed 
              since the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> began. You get a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> that's around 10[120] 
              (10 to the 120). It's a little bigger - 10[122] (10 to the 122) 
              or something like that - but within astrophysical units, where if 
              you're within a factor of one hundred, you feel that you're okay;</p>
<p>The other way you can calculate it is by calculating how it <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>es 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> goes on. The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> has evolved up to now, but how long 
              could it go? One way to figure this out is to take the phenomenological 
              observation of how much <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> there is, but another is to assume, 
              in a Guthian fashion, that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is at its critical density. 
              Then there's a simple formula for the critical density of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              in terms of its age; G, the gravitational constant; and the speed 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. You plug that into this formula, assuming the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              is at critical density, and you find that the total <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of ops 
              that could have been performed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (T) since 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> began is actually the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> divided by 
              the Planck scale - the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at which quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> becomes <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              - quantity squared. That is, it's the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> squared, 
              divided by the Planck length, quantity squared. This is really just 
              taking the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> divided by h-bar, and plugging in a formula for 
              the critical density, and that's the answer you get.</p>
<p>This is just a big <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>. It's reminiscent of other famous big 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s that are bandied about by numerologists. These large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s 
              are, of course, associated with all sorts of terrible crank <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. 
              For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, there's the famous Eddington Dirac <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, which is 
              10[40] (10 to the 40). It's the ratio between the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              and the classical size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>, and also the ratio between 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> force of, say, the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, and the gravitational 
              force on the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>. Dirac went down the garden path to try 
              to make a theory in which this large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> had to be what it was. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> that I've come up with is suspiciously reminiscent of 
              (10[40])[3] (10 to the 40, quantity cubed). This <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, 10[120], 
              (10 to the 120) is normally regarded as a coincidence, but in fact 
              it's not a coincidence that the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of ops that could have been 
              performed since the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> began is this <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> cubed, because 
              it actually turns out to be the first one squared times the other 
              one. So whether these two <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s are the same could be a coincidence, 
              but the fact that this one is equal to them cubed is not.</p>
<p>Having calculated the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s that 
              could have been performed since the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> began, I went and calculated 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of bits, which is a similar, standard sort of calculation. 
              Say that we took all of this beautiful <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> around us on lovely 
              Eastover Farm, and vaporized it into a fireball of radiation. This 
              would be the maximum <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> state, and would enable it to store 
              the largest possible amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. You can easily calculate 
              how many bits could be stored by the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> that we have 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> right now, and the answer turns out to be 10[90] 
              (10 to the 90). This is necessary, just by standard cosmological 
              calculations - it's (10[120])[3/4] (10 to the 120, quantity to the 
              3/4 power). We can store 10[90] (10 to the 90) bits in <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, and 
              if one believes in somewhat speculative theories about quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> 
              such as holography - in which the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that can 
              be stored in a volume is bounded by the area of the volume divided 
              by the Planck Scale squared - and if you assume that somehow <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              can be stored mysteriously on unknown gravitational degrees of <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>, 
              then again you get 10[120] (10 to the 120). This is because, of 
              course, the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> squared divided by the Planck length 
              squared is equal to the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> squared divided by 
              the Planck length. So the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> squared, divided by 
              the Planck <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> squared is equal to the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> divided 
              by the Planck length, quantity squared. So we can do 10[120] (10 
              to the 120) ops on 10[90] (10 to the 90) bits.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>    Maybe Microsoft won't have to 'rely on Moore's Law to save their butts' after all. After reaching the 600 year mark when Moore's Law would no longer apply, I'm not really sure why they would want to stop at particle processing units either, when they would probably be able to use the infinitely small proportions given by a spatial singularity (since space-time curvature reaches infinity). This may not agree with quantum gravity, but if we assume the existence of point masses, they would have infinite density and zero volume to work with given the predictions of General Relativity (i.e. where there would not be any physical limit on the size of particles). That all works assuming a metric that allows both coordinate and absolute singularities wherever a point mass occurs in the equations. This would give us infinite density, infinite force of gravity, and infinite curvature of space around that point mass. Thus Microsoft would be able to rely on harnessing this if they can find away around the minor problem of escaping the event horizon.
<br>
<br>
	Let us even consider disallowing point masses, by several means. For example, the wavelength limits suggestion put forth by quantum theory, or even postulations in string theory regarding the dimensions of space-time. One must take into account of course that quantum theory is incompatible with General Relativity inside a black hole (assuming that a singularity occurs within a black hole), so we take into account that there could be some other explanation that we do not yet know of why point masses cannot occur. 
<br>
<br>
	Even in this case, we can consider a source of processing units other than the matter we know of in our universe. Could the key possibly lie in some kind of traversable (inter-universe) Einstein-Rosen Bridge? I am not an expert on this, but from what I understand this could be possible. Although the vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations are understood to produce unstable wormholes (in which light can't even get through). If we assume that Lorentzian traversable (inter-universe) wormholes are possible, then we might have a possible solution. These types of wormholes in general relativity were demonstrated by Kip Thorne and Mike Morris in a 1988 paper. This would imply the existence of exotic matter, where a spherical shell of exotic matter could be used to hold open the 'throat' of a Morris-Thorne wormhole. Also, Matt Visser showed other types of traversable wormholes held open by cosmic strings that were solutions to general relativity. So for now let us assume that we can in fact have such an Einstein-Rosen bridge. 
<br>
<br>
	Given all of this, Microsoft would possibly have the option of traversing such a wormhole to an alternate universe to take advantage of a new source of matter-energy for processing units. Another idea this brings up is higher dimensional space, where instead of using a cube of matter, you use something like a tesseract or measure polytope of some kind. A good way to visualize this is to use Michio Kaku's flatland analogy. A 3D sphere passing through such a 2D universe could be seen as a circle with increasing and decreasing radius. If a flatlander could manipulate the sphere somehow, maybe by linearly combining all the circles, he would have the volume of the sphere at his disposal, would he not?  So couldn't Microsoft instead use a tesseract in the 5th spatial dimension for example, to provide more options in processing units, or would this not really make any sense? Another interesting question is what role time could play in all of this, and whether time can somehow be used to provide more processing options?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I was thinking of writing an essay, detailing how type II civilizations could build a galactic xylophone out of the chrystal spheres that house the planets. But then it ocurred to me that, since numerous observations have falsified this model of the solar system, it was probably a waste of time.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, observations have falsified the assumption that redshift=expansion and so the very foundation of Big Bang cosmology has no choice but to collapse in utter humiliation.
<br>
<br>
But why is the Big Bang still spoken of as the only choice for the serious scientist? Well, this is what some 'serious scientists' say about it: 
<br>
<br>
'The big bang theory can boast of no quantitative predictions that have subsequently been validated by observation. The successes claimed by the theory's supporters consist of its ability to retrospectively fit observations with a steadily increasing array of adjustable parameters, just as the old Earth-centred cosmology of Ptolemy needed layer upon layer of epicycles. 
<br>
<br>
Yet the big bang is not the only framework available for understanding the history of the universe. Plasma cosmology and the steady-state model both hypothesise an evolving universe without beginning or end. These and other alternative approaches can also explain the basic phenomena of the cosmos, including the abundances of light elements, the generation of large-scale structure, the cosmic background radiation, and how the redshift of far-away galaxies increases with distance. They have even predicted new phenomena that were subsequently observed, something the big bang has failed to do. 
<br>
<br>
Supporters of the big bang theory may retort that these theories do not explain every cosmological observation. But that is scarcely surprising, as their development has been severely hampered by a complete lack of funding. Indeed, such questions and alternatives cannot even now be freely discussed and examined. An open exchange of ideas is lacking in most mainstream conferences. Whereas Richard Feynman could say that "science is the culture of doubt", in cosmology today doubt and dissent are not tolerated, and young scientists learn to remain silent if they have something negative to say about the standard big bang model. Those who doubt the big bang fear that saying so will cost them their funding. 
<br>
<br>
Even observations are now interpreted through this biased filter, judged right or wrong depending on whether or not they support the big bang. So discordant data on red shifts, lithium and helium abundances, and galaxy distribution, among other topics, are ignored or ridiculed. This reflects a growing dogmatic mindset that is alien to the spirit of free scientific enquiry. 
<br>
<br>
Today, virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology are devoted to big bang studies. Funding comes from only a few sources, and all the peer-review committees that control them are dominated by supporters of the big bang. As a result, the dominance of the big bang within the field has become self-sustaining, irrespective of the scientific validity of the theory. 
<br>
<br>
Giving support only to projects within the big bang framework undermines a fundamental element of the scientific method -- the constant testing of theory against observation. Such a restriction makes unbiased discussion and research impossible. To redress this, we urge those agencies that fund work in cosmology to set aside a significant fraction of their funding for investigations into alternative theories and observational contradictions of the big bang. To avoid bias, the peer review committee that allocates such funds could be composed of astronomers and physicists from outside the field of cosmology. 
<br>
<br>
Allocating funding to investigations into the big bang's validity, and its alternatives, would allow the scientific process to determine our most accurate model of the history of the universe'.

A trump card that is often played by Big Bang supporters is that its papers have undergone the peer review process. But there is at least one instance that proves this process is not as perfect at sorting out science from quackery as you might suppose.
<br>
<br>
The disgraced Korean scientist  Hwang Woo-suk was not outed by the peer review process. Indeed, the well respected journals Nature and Science published his papers. Rather, he was found out in chat room discussions.
<br>
<br>
Where cosmology is concerned, the peer review process has turned into a monoculture where any paper not Big Bang-orientated is dismissed out-of-hand. Given the superior success of plasma cosmology and EU this is clearly not a healthy way of getting to the truth.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the story of Woo-suk should serve as a guide that forums open to free-flowing ideas and no-holds-barred criticism are now superior avenues for scientific discussion?
