              Published on KurzweilAI.net February 27, 2001.</p>
<p>Some 20 to 140 years from now--depending on which <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary or <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s theorist, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist, or <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> you happen to agree with--the rate of self-catalyzing, self-organizing technological change in our local environment will undergo a "<a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>," becoming effectively instantaneous from the perspective of current <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humanity.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that events after this point must also be "<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>-incomprehensible" to existing humanity, though we disagree.</p>
<p>Some social theorists have proposed that the currently breathtaking rate of change or "<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>" in 21st century <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> cannot continue to accelerate indefinitely. Apparent support for this position comes from the "sigmoidal <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>" ("S curves") of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, where resource limits lead to periodic "crash phases" in population size.</p>
<p>Also, physical limits affect <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing within any specific <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, such as the widely cited <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> limit in <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s ("<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>"), which will be reached circa 2010.</p>
<p>But such arguments are astonishingly irrelevant to the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing as an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, because <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> arises out of and controls the continuous reorganization of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. In the known <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s have always discovered ever-more-clever ways to rearrange themselves using less <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, less <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, and less material resources during <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, thus making them "<a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>-independent," or free of the limits to <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> which affect any particular material <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>.</p>
<p>Consider our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of accelerating creation of first pre-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> (atomic and molecular-based), then genetic (<a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-based), then neurologic (<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>-based), then memetic (mental <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-based), and finally, technologic (extra-cerebral-<a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> based) <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary epochs, each requiring less <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to represent or perform any <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> "<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>" (i.e., forming an encoded internal representation of the laws or <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> of the external environment).</p>
<p>The brief <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (which have themselves moved through five <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s over the last century: mechanical, electromechanical, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, and IC) makes this process of "accelerating rearrangement" even clearer. The Universal <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> involves the continuous movement to new <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s, with emergent forms always exponentially increasing their <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing pace over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>We are on a wild ride to an interesting destination, a local rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al change so fast and powerful that it must have a profound and as-yet-unclarified Universal effect. As a side effect of this hypergrowth, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings will not be able to meaningfully understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-driven world of the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> unless they make some kind of transition to "<a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a>ity."</p>
<p>Those <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s who study this accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion and its current and anticipated effect on humanity call it "the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>" for several <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. The oldest <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, as introduced by <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a> in 1982, stems from the idea of a mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>, a point in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at which one's existing models of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> are no longer valid.</p>
<p>One place we observe this is within a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>, where the equations of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> no longer hold, generating only infinities. As I will describe in my forthcoming book, several other insightful ways of understanding the coming <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> may also be usefully employed.</p><h1>A Brief <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> of Intellectual Discussion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a></h1><p>Many groups have helped build our present understanding of accelerating change, and I will also be presenting a "Longer <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a>" later in 2001. We'll begin our Brief <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists of WWII. An <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant and dramatic, if not entirely accurate place to start. For an excellent read, I suggest <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a><i>: The Enigma</i>, Hodges and Hofstadter, 2000.</p>
<p>It appears that the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists to consider the issue of accelerating change, in casual <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>, were its modern visionaries and founders, including both <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> (1940's) and John Von Neumann (1950's). Von Neumann may have been the first to use the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>" to describe this accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion (see Vinge's "<u>The Technological </u><a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>").</p>
<p>Ongoing informal discussions in this community eventually led to works by <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> ("<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100510190227/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html" target="_new"> There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a>" 1959), a revolutionary article that implicitly assumes accelerating change in a very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant new <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, and I.J. Good ("Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>," 1965), perhaps the first clear published <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ualization of the coming <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>.</p>
<p>A year earlier, in 1964, <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, co-founder of Intel, had made his now famous prediction regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> density doubling (every 18 to 24 months) in the new medium of metal oxide <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> (MOS) <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s.</p>
<p>At first, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> simply defined the economic and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering environment specific to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> development, and gradually an entire industry of scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers came to not only intellectually appreciate, but to tangibly <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> the local effects of continuous accelerating change.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1960's and 1970's a growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of insightful analysts, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s theorists and cyberneticians developed models of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> which began to incorporate trend curves of accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al change in various industry and generalizt publications (most prominently, <i>Scientific American</i>).</p>
<p>At the close of the 1960's. no one in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> really knew how long the curves might last (excepting a very limited <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of visionaries, as mentioned), or how relevant they might be to the larger world of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> affairs. But the gate was open, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> was afoot.</p>
<p>Serious investigation of <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> scenarios received a major upgrade around this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, including a few that recognized the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of accelerating change, thanks to the excellent work of Edward Cornish and the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100510190227/http://www.wfs.org/" target="_new">World Future Society</a>, and the bimonthly publication of <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">Futurist</a> Magazine</i> since 1967.</p>
<p>The idea of accelerating change finally entered the public <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> through Alvin Toffler and his revolutionary <i><a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Shock</i>, 1970. Throughout the 1970's, the implications of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> as a signifier of general <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally-driven scientific and social change were <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ively being explored.</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, there were a few groundbreaking attempts to characterize and popularize the observed trajectory of ever more integrative and self-balancing local <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, most publically by F.M. Esfandiary (later, FM-2030) (<i><a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">Optimism</a> One</i>, 1970, <i>Tele-Spheres</i>, 1977 and <i>Up-Wingers: A <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">Futurist</a> Manifesto</i>, 1973.) These three luminous books were published in paperback in 1977 and 1978, and eventually became known as the "<a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">Transhuman</a>ist Trilogy," setting the stage for the <a class="thought" href="entries/extropian_entry.html">Extropian</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a>ist movements of the 1980's.</p>
<p>The mid to late 1980's were a modern version of the "<a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> Explosion" in our scientific understanding of accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al change within various specialties, with simultaneous breakthroughs in the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s, connectionist and parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, and several other fields best left for my forthcoming "Longer <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a>."</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, consideration of accelerating change from a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s perspective finally became broadly <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible to the general public, through groundbreaking popular works, by such authors as <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/society_of_mind_entry.html">Society of Mind</a>, 1985), Erik Drexler (<i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i>, 1986), and <a class="thought" href="entries/moravec_entry.html">Hans Moravec</a> (<i><a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> Children</i>, 1988).</p>
<p>These three books respectively represented a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> as an emergent collective <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, a framework for applying <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and embodied environmental interaction on as-yet-undreamed scales of <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, and the first coherent projection of the meaning of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cognitive_science_entry.html">cognitive science</a>s for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. These early authors risked professional reputation in their own fields to advance their unique ideas, and each deserves special recognition for their courage, conviction, and clarity of vision.</p>
<p>In the 1990's, a flood of generalizt publications that are implicitly <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>-aware, and a bold few that are explicitly <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>-aware, such as those by John Brockman (ed., <i>The Third Culture</i>, 1995), <a class="thought" href="entries/broderick_entry.html">Damien Broderick</a> (<i>The Spike</i>, 1997) and Richard Coren (<i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary Trajectory</i>, 1998) became available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the mass medium of the new millennium (the Web), Max and <a class="thought" href="entries/vita_more_entry.html">Natasha Vita-More</a> (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100510190227/http://www.extropy.org/" target="_new">Extropy.org</a>), <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100510190227/http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html" target="_new">Robin Hansen</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/bostrom_entry.html">Nick Bostrom</a> (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100510190227/http://www.transhumanism.org/" target="_new">Transhuman.org</a>), again <a class="thought" href="entries/moravec_entry.html">Hans Moravec</a> and most centrally, <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a> brought these ideas to <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the 1990s with their careful analysis of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> and its variants. <a class="thought" href="entries/yudkowsky_entry.html">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> also has prolific writings in this area, along with a community of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> investigators and "<a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100510190227/http://singinst.org/lists/sing.html" target="_new">advocates</a>" and a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonprofit_entry.html">nonprofit</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> venture with <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a>ists Brian and Sabine Atkins.</p>
<p>At present, in 2001, only a few tens of thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s have been exposed to the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a>, mostly through the web. But soon, the general <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> will become even more mainstream, as it is confronted by <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ing think tanks such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> scenario leader <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a>.</p>

<br>
I went to a discussion on nanotechnology at The University of Washington this evening (4-16-2002). After the lecture I had a few questions so I approached the microphone. I decided to first make certain that the speaker (a well known celebrated nanotechnologist) thoroughly understood the concept of the singularity before I asked my questions. Much to my surprise the speaker didn't have the slightest idea of what I was talking about. The audience murmered, and my girlfriend later told me she heard people snickering and talking about me like I was some sort of retarded nut for bringing up a term like "singularity" at a nanotechnology lecture. I shook my head and left the event.
<br>
<br>
It is important to note that the UW's nano program is a PHD level program! You must understand my surprise at the lack of current understanding in this area of science. I left the room with everyone looking at me like I was an insane and retarded freak. This might sound strange, but I had a good time with it all. I'm just a follower sheep in this field, but I was made out to be Max Planke or Nikola Tesla. LOL I figure you geniuses that are actually inventing these futuristic concepts must really be getting kicked in the teeth.
<br>
<br>
What's up? By now I suppose 40 thousand people are familiar with this terminology? How come none of them live in Washington?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You have to realize that anyone who is dealing in nanotechnology, yet is unaware of a) the concept of the Singularity, whether ultimately a real or imagined phenomena, and b) Superstring and/or M-theory -- is a mOron.
<br>
<br>
So yes, Academia is filled with mostly dumbed-down, sleeplike mOrons.  Hey, I was there once too -- on both coasts -- they're all mostly beer-drinking kids who are clueless about the future.  And one reason they are clueless is because they spend too much time watching the MPAA-infested media, screwing while on drugs and failing to read enough relevant books and periodicals.  The only crap they get to read, and HAVE to read, is the politically correct stuff the professors shove down their faces.  They also don't frequent sites like this enough, roll up their shirtsleeves and fight it out in a public forum.  College is a thing of the past.  The Net IS college.  Home schooling IS college.  Interacting with the people IS college.  Working IS college.  The other stuff is horse.
<br>
<br>
Even most of the lofty commercial writers who sit back and MAKE MONEY writing books are falling WAY behind the action.  Their books are becoming less and less real to the degree they aren't out in forums like this HASHING OUT things (and under their real_names, IF they have any balls, which most do NOT).  By the time a book comes out -- who cares -- it's OLD NEWS.  Look I've written and published 6 books and 98 training manuals in the pre-web decade, but every time I get my 7th book on the way, or done, it's an outdated piece of crap. 
<br>
<br>
So the Singularity has definitely already HIT the publishing and movie worlds -- and since the bozos you encountered tonight are totally emerged in both -- are you really surprised?  Sounds like the Singularity has already sucked up the nano-buffs there as well.
<br>
<br>
Feel better?

Why would all people dealing in nanotechnology HAVE to know about the singularity and M-Theory or be morons? That's pretty black or white don't you think?

People working on carbon nanotube electronics are morons if they don't know about the idea of a singularity? In what direct way does the idea of a singularity relate to the failure/success of their efforts?

I understand there may indeed be many 'morons' in the field, especially in academia though I really wouldn't know, and knowing about things like the law of accelerating returns would seem to be of value for people dealing with advanced technology ideas. However, I find repulsive the ease with which you malign others you don't even know.
<br>
<br>
As far as needing to hash things out in forums like this under real names or be considered ball-less? Well I really think you give to much credit to this forum and your participation in it. I haven't seen too much of anything original in this forum approaching the level of thorough, thoughtful and in-depth analyses and information with which I've received from books, short papers and internet sites like the rest of KurzweilAI. 
<br>
<br>
By the way I come to this forum because I have been under the impression this is the best/easiest/most available place to talk to like minded technology enthusiasts, laymen or otherwise, and get the most relevant input possible on personal tech/future related questions. Kind of a casual place really, maybe I've been wrong.

I'd like to know who the person was. Just curiosity.

I must say it's too bad the person giving the lecture didn't know about the singularity but I'm not totally surprised, it's still seems a bit of a niche thing. As far as the crowd thinking poorly of you, that I would have guessed as I know nobody with any real interest in the singularity but those of you on this forum. I really don't know all that many people though. ;)

<br>
Vogel is obviously no dummy, and it is not my intention to run down her reputation. In fact I am certain that she is brighter than myself. At least the Max Planke Institute would probably argue in favor of that.
<br>
<br>
I suppose it is polite to ask questions about the material that was directly presented, but I thought her presentation was done well enough that most of the near future implications were obvious. Hence, I desired to get slightly abstract. 
<br>
<br>
All the other people who asked questions were asking totally obvious stuff like, "do you think nano can help with blood clotting at some point in the future?" To me, questions like that are a waste of time. That is like asking a math guy, "what is 2 + 2?"
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I can't expect someone to know everything. I suppose this is a case of specialized knowledge, so I can forgive Vogel, but those giggling and sighing in the audience; their education was a waste of time and money. No amount of costly educational brainwashing will provide them with intelligence. Lucky for them nano induced transhumanism is on the way.

i've read the singularity papers ( and i consider them to be absolute

( even though i never play it ) by some miracle..however unlikely it may seem.

point introducing theories with no proof (other than the belief it may 
<br>
happen at some point in the far future) at a scientific conference.

 if you believe it may happen -- prove it. become a transhumanist-whatever

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>you are missing the crucial aspect of the Singularity- like evolution it is not just a theory or idea- it is a DISCOVERY through observation of several factors- the discovery is based upon the realization of the implications of technology/ mind/ evolution and the nature of Nature- like evolution once discovered the idea cannot be put back in a box or second-guessed-  the "proof" is the discovery of the processes ITSELF- 
<br>
<br>
uncoil yourself from the stifling focus of your search for "proof" of "theories" and LOOK at the world like a Man- 
<br>
<br>
right out of the gate- we see that ultimately the destiny of humankind and the Earth can be catogorized with just 3 vectors:
<br>
<br>
-vector apocalypse: we simply destroy ourselves completely or enter a new dar age
<br>
<br>
-vector stagnation- we create new technologies- or not- but we always remain humans and human culture continues as it has [in the recent past]- this includes everything from mankind not progressing much at all- or a regretion or cycle where we always have some technology- it also includes at the extreme the standard sci-fi space-farring senario were humanity goes to the stars but remains mortal- human in culture and biology and technology-
<br>
<br>
-vector singularity- technology/consciousness are cultivated and advance to a level of complexity and utility that causes the world and Mankind to fundementally change/transcend/ascend/multiplex in such profound ways that our concepts and contexs no longer can predict or understand what will occur-
<br>
<br>
<br>
without even considering the options- we only have THREE fates- and one is Singularity- this makes it 33% likely without any other considerations! but some simple deductions reveals that #2- the vector of stagnation- is HIGHLY improbable- it is naively improbable in fact- and the vector of apocalypse? I think most posters on theis board- researches like me and lay people alike- all of us attest to the very likely probability of a Catastrophie- but why mull that over? it's to be avoided- and is a sad fate- so it does not need to be discussed really does it? also- I would conjecture that from the Gaian perspective of seeing all life/technology/mind as an emergence at the level of the whole world-organism- that a human apocalypse would merely be a brief [VERY brief] delay- not an end- unless we made the planet totally barren of Life [which I think is impossible- we don't know how to sterilize the earth- bacteria are tough buggers]-
<br>
<br>
this means that the vector of Singularity becomes not only a good possibility- but the most likely- this is unavoidable and I would posit that arguably it is unarguable ;)
<br>
<br>
now everyone has there own concept of Singularity- and also like evolution the framework is an undeniable fact- but the processes and methods are very much up for debate! this is were the argument is- what will happen when we have multiple forms of super-intelligent human and non-human analog/digital/biological/hybrid information processing networks/brains/swarms and what happens when these ecologies have access to the "Hand of God" technologies like Programmable Matter and post-nanotech quantum engineering?
<br>
<br>
regardless of what happens- the ides of the SIngularity ITSELF is involate now- like evolution- once discovered it can't go away- it exists

<br>
<br>
<br>
Predictions that are based on reasonable assumptions and have proven track records like More's Law are more attractive.
<br>
<br>
The way i predict is to look at what needs to happen before exponential growth intelligence is built.
<br>
<br>
This means a macnine or system that can problem solve fast and in a wider area (and growing wider) than men.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Usually that has meant memory X speed
<br>
<br>
<br>
which has meant storage of data somewhere, and speed of electronic transmission.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But speed can also mean speed of mutation, since there is no reason we cannot grow A.I. from biological systems.
<br>
<br>
<br>
the speed of mutation may NOT have an upper limit.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Speculation is great.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
laterally, if the outcome required is intelligence (let's define this   for eg as problem solving)
<br>
<br>
<br>
then the inputs can be anything at all.....not just the trafditional roots of speed of processing using memory manipulation (this includes learning which I call modified memory cycles in computers)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Invention.

<br>
Vision
<br>
<br>
Science
<br>
<br>
<br>
Programmming
<br>
<br>
biology
<br>
<br>
and looking always at new unusual eways of doing things.
<br>
<br>
<br>
great lecture on Paul Erlich (video) at our site (Royal Society lecture).
<br>
<br>
many geniuses pay their price to the gods in a handicap or mental/spiritual physical health money.
<br>
<br>
<br>
i've souhgt out and met many famous great minds and they are without exception paying like crazt fro their great gifts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
science is a method.
<br>
<br>
without values it become a master and unhuman.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
we can invent within the context of humaness.
<br>
<br>
i dont think the next Big Bang is far away, but i was sure A.I. would be here two years ago and went fishing.
