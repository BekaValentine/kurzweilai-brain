<div class="TeaserText">Vivekananda attempts to answer the question: are we mortal or immortal? If we are mortal, no further questions need be asked. But if we are immortal, what are the logical arguments that support this idea and what is it that endures after death? From his talk delivered over a hundred years ago.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally presented over a hundred years ago. Published on KurzweilAI.net April 26, 2001.</p>
<p>What question has been asked a greater number of times, what idea has led men more to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> for an answer, what question is nearer and dearer to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> heart, what question is more inseparably connected with our existence, than this one, the <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> soul? It has been the theme of poets and sages, of priests and prophets; kings on the throne have discussed it, beggars in the street have dreamt of it. The best of humanity have approached it, and the worst of men have hoped for it. The interest in the theme has not died yet, nor will it die so long a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> exists. Various answers have been presented to the world by various minds. Thousands, again, in every period of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> have given up the discussion, and yet the question remains fresh as ever. Often in the turmoil and struggle of our lives we seem to forget it, but suddenly some one dies--one, perhaps, whom we loved, one near and dear to our hearts, is snatched away from us--and the struggle, the din and turmoil of the world around us, cease for a moment, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> asks the old question, "What after this? What becomes of the soul?"</p>
<p>All <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> proceeds out of experience; we cannot know anything except by experience. All our <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing is based upon generalised experience, all our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is but harmonised experience. Looking around us, what do we find? A continuous change. The plant comes out of the seed, grows into the tree, completes the circle, and comes back to the seed. The <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> comes, lives a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, dies, and completes the circle. So does man. The mountains slowly but surely crumble away, the rivers slowly but surely dry up, rains come out of the sea, and go back to the sea. Everywhere circles are being completed, birth, <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, development, and decay following each other with mathematical precision. This is our everyday experience. Inside of it all, behind all this vast mass of what we call <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, of millions of forms and shapes, millions upon millions of varieties, beginning from the lowest <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> to the highest <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ualised man, we find existing a certain unity. Every day we find that the wall that was <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to be dividing one thing and another is being broken down, and all <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is coming to be recognised by modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> as one substance manifesting in different ways and in various forms; the one <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> that runs through all like a continuous chain, of which all these various forms represent the links, link after link, extending almost infinitely, but of the same one chain. This is what is called <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. It is an old, old idea, as old as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> society, only it is getting fresher and fresher as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ing. There is one thing more, which the ancients perceived, but which in modern times is not yet so clearly perceived, and that is involution. The seed is becoming the plant; a grain of sand never becomes a plant. It is the father that becomes a child; a lump of clay never becomes the child. From what does this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> come, is the question. What was the seed? It was the same as the tree. All the possibilities of a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> tree are in that seed; all the possibilities of a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> man are in the little baby; all the possibilities of any <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> are in the germ. What is this? The ancient philosophers of India called it involution. We find then, that every <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> presupposes an involution. Nothing can be evolved which is not already there. Here, again, modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> comes to our help. You know by mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing that the sum total of the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that is displayed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is the same throughout. You cannot take away one <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> or one foot-pound of force. You cannot add to the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> one <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> or one foot-pound of force. As such, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> does not come out of zero; then, where does it come from? From previous involution. The child is the man involved, and the man is the child evolved. The seed is the tree involved, and the tree is the seed evolved. All the possibilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> are in the germ. The problem becomes a little clearer. Add to it the first idea of continuation of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. From the lowest protoplasm to the most perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being there is really but one <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Just as in one <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> we have so many various phases of <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, the protoplasm developing into the baby, the child, the young man, the old man, so, from that protoplasm up to the most perfect man we get one continuous <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, one chain. This is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but we have seen that each <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> presupposes an involution. The whole of this <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> which slowly manifests itself evolves itself from the protoplasm to the perfected <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being, the Incarnation of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>--the whole of this series is but one <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and the whole of this manifestation must have been involved in that very protoplasm. This whole <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, this very <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>, was involved in it and slowly came out, manifesting itself slowly, slowly, slowly. The highest <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> must have been there in the germ state in minute form; therefore this one force, this whole chain, is the involution of that cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> which is everywhere. It is this one mass of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> which, from the protoplasm up to the most perfected man, is slowly and slowly uncoiling itself. Not that it grows. Take off all ideas of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> from your mind. With the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> is associated something coming from outside, something extraneous, which would give the lie to the truth that the Infinite which lies latent in every <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is independent of all external conditions. It can never grow; It was always there, and only manifests Itself.</p>
<p>The effect is the cause manifested. There is no essential difference between the effect and the cause. Take this glass, for instance. There was the material, and that material plus the will of the manufacturer made the glass; and these two were its causes and are present in it. In what form is the will present? As adhesion. If the force were not here, each <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> would fall away. What is the effect then? It is the same as the cause, only taking a different form, a different composition. When the cause is changed and limited for a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it becomes the effect. We must remember this. Applying it to our idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, the whole of the manifestation of this one series, from the protoplasm up to the most perfect man, must be the very same thing as cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. First it got involved and became finer; and out of that fine something, which was the cause, it has gone on evolving, manifesting itself, and becoming grosser.</p>
<p>But the question of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> is not yet settled. We have seen that everything in this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is indestructible. There is nothing new; there will be nothing new. The same series of manifestations are presenting themselves alternately like a wheel, coming up and going down. All motion in this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is in the form of waves, successively rising and falling. <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s after <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are coming out of fine forms, evolving themselves, and taking grosser forms, again melting down, as it were, and going back to the fine forms. Again they rise out of that, evolving for a certain period and slowly going back to the cause. So with all <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Each manifestation of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is coming up and then going back again. What goes down? The form. The form breaks to pieces, but it comes up again. In one <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> bodies and forms even are eternal. How? Suppose we take a number of dice and throw them, and they fall in this ratio--6--5--3--4. We take the dice up and throw them again and again, there must be a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when the same numbers will come again; the same combination must come. Now each <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>, each <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, that is in this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, I take for such a die, and these are being thrown out and combined again and again. All these forms before you are one combination. Here are the forms of a glass, a table, a pitcher of water, and so forth. This is one combination; in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it will all break. But there must come a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when exactly the same combination comes again, when you will be here, and this form will be here, this subject will be talked, and this pitcher will be here. An infinite number of times this has been, and an infinite number of times this will be repeated. Thus far with the physical forms. What do we find? That even the combination of physical forms is eternally repeated.</p>
<p>A most interesting conclusion that follows from this theory is the explanation of facts such as these: Some of you, perhaps, have seen a man who can read the past <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of others and foretell the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. How is it possible for any one to see what the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will be, unless there is a regulated <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? Effects of the past will recur in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, and we see that it is so. You have seen the big Ferris Wheel<sup>1</sup> in Chicago. The wheel revolves, and the little rooms in the wheel are regularly coming one after another; one <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of persons gets into these, and after they have gone round the circle, they get out, and a fresh batch of people gets in. Each one of these batches is like one of these manifestations, from the lowest <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> to the highest man. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> is like the chain of the Ferris Wheel, endless and infinite, and these little carriages are the bodies or forms in which fresh batches of souls are riding, going up higher and higher until they become perfect and come out of the wheel. But the wheel goes on. And so long as the bodies are in the wheel, it can be absolutely and mathematically foretold where they will go, but not so of the souls. Thus it is possible to read the past and the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> with precision. We see, then, that there is recurrence of the same material phenomena at certain periods, and that the same combinations have been taking place through eternity. But that is not the <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. No force can die, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> can be annihilated. What becomes of it? It goes on changing, backwards and forwards, until it returns to the source from which it came. There is no motion in a straight line. Everything moves in a circle; a straight line, infinitely produced, becomes a circle. If that is the case, there cannot be eternal degeneration for any <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. It cannot be. Everything must complete the circle, and come back to its source. What are you and I and all these souls? In our discussion of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and involution, we have seen that you and I must be part of the cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, cosmic mind, which got involved and we must complete the circle and go back to this cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> which is <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. This cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is what people call Lord, or <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, or Christ, or Buddha, or Brahman, what the materialists perceive as force, and the agnostics as that infinite, inexpressible beyond; and we are all parts of that.</p>
<p>This is the second idea, yet this is not sufficient; there will be still more doubts. It is very good to say that there is no destruction for any force. But all the forces and forms that we see are combinations. This form before us is a composition of several <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> parts, and so every force that we see is similarly composite. If you take the scientific idea of force, and call it the sum total, the resultant of several forces, what becomes of your individuality? Everything that is a compound must sooner or later go back to its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> parts. Whatever in this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is the result of the combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> or force must sooner or later go back to its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. Whatever is the result of certain causes must die, must be destroyed. It gets broken up, dispersed, and resolved back into its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a> is not a force; neither is it <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. It is the manufacturer of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, but not <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> itself; it is the manufacturer of the body, but not the body. Why so? We see that the body cannot be the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. Why not? Because it is not intelligent. A corpse is not intelligent, nor a piece of meat in a butcher's shop. What do we mean by <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>? Reactive power. We want to go a little more deeply into this. Here is a pitcher; I see it. How? Rays of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> from the pitcher enter my eyes, and make a picture in my <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>, which is carried to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Yet there is no vision. What the physiologists call the sensory nerves carry this impression inwards. But up to this there is no reaction. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> centre in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> carries the impression to the mind, and the mind reacts, and as soon as this reaction comes, the pitcher flashes before it. Take a more commonplace example. Suppose you are listening to me intently and a mosquito is sitting on the tip of your nose and giving you that pleasant sensation which mosquitoes can give; but you are so intent on hearing me that you do not feel the mosquito at all. What has happened? The mosquito has bitten a certain part of your skin, and certain nerves are there. They have carried a certain sensation to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and the impression is there, but the mind, being otherwise occupied, does not react, so you are not aware of the presence of the mosquito. When a new impression comes, if the mind does not react, we shall not be conscious of it, but when the reaction comes we feel, we see, we hear, and so forth. With this reaction comes illumination, as the Sankhya philosophers call it. We see that the body cannot illuminate, because in the absence of attention no sensation is possible. Cases have been known where, under peculiar conditions, a man who had never learnt a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> was found able to speak it. Subsequent inquiries proved that the man had, when a child, lived among people who spoke that <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and the impressions were left in his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. These impressions remained stored up there, until through some cause the mind reacted, and illumination came, and then the man was able to speak the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. This shows that the mind alone is not sufficient, that the mind itself is an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> in the hands of someone. In the case of that boy the mind contained that <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, yet he did not know it, but later there came a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when he did. It shows that there is someone besides the mind; and when the boy was a baby, that someone did not use the power; but when the boy grew up, he took advantage of it, and used it. First, here is the body, second the mind; or <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, and third behind this mind is the Self of man. The Sanskrit word is atman. As modern philosophers have identified <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> with molecular changes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, they do not know how to explain such a case, and they generally deny it. The mind is intimately connected with the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> which dies every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the body changes. The Self is the illuminator, and the mind is the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> in Its hands, and through that <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> It gets hold of the external <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, and thus comes perception. The external <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s get hold of the impressions and carry them to the organs, for you must remember always, that the eyes and ears are only receivers--it is the internal organs, the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> centres, which act. In Sanskrit these centres are called Indriyas, and they carry sensations to the mind, and the mind presents them further back to another state of the mind, which in Sanskrit is called Chitta, and there they are organised into will, and all these present them to the King of kings inside, the Ruler on His throne, the Self of man. He then sees and gives His orders. Then the mind immediately acts on the organs, and the organs on the external body. The real Perceiver, the real Ruler, the Governor, the Creator, the Manipulator of all this, is the Self of man.</p>
<p>We see, then, that the Self of man is not the body, neither is It <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. It cannot be a compound. Why not? Because everything that is a compound can be seen or imagined. That which we cannot imagine or perceive, which we cannot bind together, is not force or <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> cause or effect, and cannot be a compound. The domain of compounds is only so far as our mental <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> extends. Beyond this it does not hold good; it is as far as law reigns, and if there is anything beyond law, it cannot be a compound at all. The Self of man being beyond the law of causation, is not a compound. It is ever free and is the Ruler of everything that is within law. It will never die, because <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> means going back to the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>, parts, and that which was never a compound can never die. It is sheer nonsense to say It dies.</p>
<p>We are now treading on finer and finer ground, and some of you, perhaps, will be frightened. We have seen that this Self, being beyond the little <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and force and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, is a simple; and as a simple It cannot die. That which does not die cannot live. For <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> are the obverse and reverse of the same coin. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is another name for <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. One particular mode of manifestation is what we call life; another particular mode of manifestation of the same thing is what we call <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> rises on the top it is life; and when it falls into the hollow it is <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. If anything is beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, we naturally see it must also be beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. I must remind you of the first conclusion that the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> of man is part of the cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that exists, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. We now find that it is beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. You were never born, and you will never die. What is this birth and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> that we see around us? This belongs to the body only, because the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> is omnipresent. "How can that be?" you may ask. "So many people are sitting here, and you say the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> is omnipresent?" What is there, I ask, to limit anything that is beyond law, beyond causation? This glass is limited; it is not omnipresent, because the surrounding <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> forces it to take that form, does not allow it to expand. It is conditioned by everything around it, and is, therefore, limited. But that which is beyond law, where there is nothing to act upon it, how can that be limited? It must be omnipresent. You are everywhere in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. How is it then that I am born and I am going to die, and all that? That is the talk of ignorance, hallucination of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. You were neither born, nor will you die. You have had neither birth, nor will have rebirth, nor <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, nor incarnation, nor anything. What do you mean by coming and going! All shallow nonsense. You are everywhere. Then what is this coming and going? It is the hallucination produced by the change of this fine body which you call the mind. That is going on. Just a little speck of cloud passing before the sky. As it moves on and on, it may create the delusion that the sky moves. Sometimes you see a cloud moving before the moon, and you think that the moon is moving. When you are in a train you think the land is flying, or when you are in a boat, you think the water moves. In reality you are neither going nor coming, you are not being born, nor going to be reborn; you are infinite, ever-present, beyond all causation, and ever-free. Such a question is out of place, it is arrant nonsense. How could there be <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> when there was no birth?</p>
<p>One step more we will have to take to come to a logical conclusion. There is no half-way house. You are metaphysicians, and there is no crying quarter. If then we are beyond all law, we must be omniscient, ever-blessed; all <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> must be in us and all power and blessedness. Certainly. You are the omniscient, omnipresent being of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. But of such beings can there be many? Can there be a hundred thousand millions of omnipresent beings? Certainly not. Then what becomes of us all? You are only one; there is only one such Self, and that One Self is you. Standing behind this little <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> is what we call the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a>. There is only One Being, One Existence, the ever-blessed, the omnipresent, the omniscient, the birthiess, the deathless. "Through His control the sky expands, through His control the air breathes, through His control the sun shines, and through His control all live. He is the Reality in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, He is the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a> of your <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>, nay, more, you are He, you are one with Him." Wherever there are two, there is fear, there is danger, there is conflict, there is strife. When it is all One, who is there to hate, who is there to struggle with? When it is all He, with whom can you fight? This explains the true <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of life; this explains the true <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of being. This is perfection, and this is <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. As long as you see the many, you are under delusion. "In this world of many he who sees the One, in this ever-changing world he who sees Him who never changes, as the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a> of his own <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>, as his own Self, he is free, he is blessed, he has reached the goal." Therefore know that thou <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> He; thou <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> of this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, "Tat Tvam Asi" (That thou <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>). All these various ideas that I am a man or a woman, or sick or healthy, or strong or weak, or that I hate or I <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> or have a little power, are but hallucinations. Away with them! What makes you weak? What makes you fear? You are the One Being in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. What frightens you? Stand up then and be free. Know that every <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and word that weakens you in this world is the only evil that exists. Whatever makes men weak and fear is the only evil that should be shunned. What can frighten you? If the suns come down, and the moons crumble into dust, and <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s after <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are hurled into annihilation, what is that to you? Stand as a rock; you are indestructible. You are the Self, the <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Say--"I am Existence Absolute, Bliss Absolute, <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> Absolute, I am He," and like a lion breaking its cage, break your chain and be free for ever. What frightens you, what holds you down? Only ignorance and delusion; nothing else can bind you. You are the Pure One, the Ever-blessed.</p>
<p>Silly fools tell you that you are sinners, and you sit down in a corner and weep. It is foolishness, wickedness, downright rascality to say that you are sinners! You are all <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. See you not <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> and call Him man? Therefore, if you dare, stand on that--mould your whole <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on that. If a man cuts your throat, do not say no, for you are cutting your own throat. When you help a poor man do not feel the least pride. That is worship for you, and not the cause of pride. Is not the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> you? Where is there any one that is not you? You are the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a> of this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. You are the sun, moon, and stars, it is you that are shining everywhere. The whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is you. Whom are you going to hate or to fight? Know, then, that thou <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> He, and model your whole <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> accordingly; and he who knows this and models his <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> accordingly will no more grovel in darkness.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"What question has been asked a greater number of times, what idea has led men more to search the universe for an answer, what question is nearer and dearer to the human heart, what question is more inseparably connected with our existence, than this one, the immortality of the human soul?" 
<br>
<br>
Here's a good question: Will we ever be content?
<br>
I've heard the arguments about truth and investigation. Good. I believe we are in a terribly scary situation. Immortality could very well exist. So how will we be able to spend it?
<br>
Will we ever plop down upon infinity's comfy couch, or will we enter a hellish trap of eternal anguish? What will we recieve? Some twisted trap of time or an arbitrary gift? Perhaps concurrent eternities stocked with many infinities exist. Are these ideas just magnets for socially capable schizophrenics? To me they're very real. What should we--what can we--do? I'm rooting for everyone, and sicerely hope you all exist outside myself and don't forget me. 
<br>
<br>
P.S.
<br>
Don't resort to nihilism.</p></td>
