<div class="TeaserText">Rodney Brooks is trying to build robots with properties of living systems. These include self-reproducing and self-assembling robots and one inspired by Bill Joy that wanders around the corridors, finds electrical outlets, and plugs itself in. His students' edgy projects include real-time MRI imagery, virtual colonoscopies, programs that create DNA for E. coli molecules that act as computers, and eventually, self-organizing smart biomaterials that grow into objects, such as a table.</div>

              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory, is looking for something beyond 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that we don't understand and we can't describe 
              what's going on inside living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s using <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> only. When 
              we build <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al models of living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, such as a self-evolving 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> or an artificial immunology <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> -- they're not as robust

<p>"Maybe we're missing something," Brooks asks, "but 
              what could that something be?" He is puzzled that we've got 
              all these <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> metaphors that we're playing around with -- 
              artificial immunology <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, building robots that appear lifelike 
              -- but none of them come close to real <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s in robustness 
              and in performance. "What I'm worrying about," he says, 
              "is that perhaps in looking at <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s we're missing 
              something that's always in there. You might be tempted to call it 
              an essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, but I'm not talking about anything outside of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>."<br>

              ROD BROOKS: Every nine years or so I change what I'm doing scientifically. 
              Last year, 2001, I moved away from building <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> robots to worry 
              about what the difference is between living <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and non-living 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. You have an organization of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s over here and it's 
              a living cell; you have an organization of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s over here and 
              it's just <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. What is it that makes something alive? Humberto 
              Maturana was interested in this question, as was the late Francisco 
              Varela in his work on autopoesis. More recently, <a class="thought" href="entries/kauffman_entry.html">Stuart Kauffman</a> 
              has talked about what it is that makes something living, how it 
              is a self-perpetuating <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of interrelationships. </p>
<p>We have all become <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>-centric over the last few years. 
              We've tended to think that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> explains everything. When 
              I was a kid, I had a book which described the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> as a telephone-<a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. Earlier books described it as a hydrodynamic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> or 
              a steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>. Then in the '60s it became a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. In 
              the '80s it became a massively parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. I bet 
              there's now a kid's book out there somewhere which says that the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is just like the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> because of all of its associations. 
              We're always taking the best <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that we have and using that 
              as the metaphor for the most complex things -- the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and living 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. And we've done that with <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.</p>
<p>But maybe there's more to us than <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Maybe there's something 
              beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that we don't understand and we 
              can't describe what's going on inside living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s using <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
              only. When we build <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al models of living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s -- such 
              as a self-evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> or an artificial immunology <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> -- 
              they're not as robust or rich as real living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Maybe we're 
              missing something, but what could that something be?</p>
<p>You could hypothesize that what's missing might be some aspect 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> that we don't yet understand. David Chalmers has certainly 
              used that notion when he tries to explain <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/penrose_entry.html">Roger Penrose</a> 
              uses that notion to a certain extent when he says that it's got 
              to be the quantum effects in the microtubules. He's looking for 
              some <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> that we already understand but are just not describing 
              well enough.</p>
<p>If we look back at how people tried to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a> 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of Kepler and Copernicus, we notice that they had their 
              observations, <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>, and a. They could describe what was happening 
              in those terms, but it wasn't until they had <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> that they 
              were really able to make predictions and have a really good model 
              of what was happening. My working <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> is that in our understanding 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and of how lots of pieces interact we're stuck at 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/algebra_entry.html">algebra</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> stage. There's some other tool -- some organizational 
              principle -- that we need to understand in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to really describe 
              what's going on. </p>
<p>And maybe that tool doesn't have to be disruptive. If we look at 
              what happened in the late 19th century through the middle of the 
              20th, there were a couple of very disruptive things that happened 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>. The whole world changed. 
              But <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> also came along in that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> period -- around the 
              1930s -- and that wasn't disruptive. If you were to take a 19th 
              century mathematician and sit him down in front of a chalk board, 
              you could explain the ideas of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to him in a few days. 
              He wouldn't be saying, "My <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, that can't be true!" But 
              if we took a 19th century physicist (or for that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, an ordinary 
              person in the 21st century) and tried to explain <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> 
              to him, he would say, "That can't be true. It's too disruptive." 
              It's a completely different way of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Using <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to 
              look at physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is not disruptive to the extent that it 
              needs its own special <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>; it's just a way of looking 
              at organization.</p>
<p>So, my mid-<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> crisis has been to scale down looking 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> robots and to start looking at the very simple question 
              of what makes something alive, and what the organizing principles 
              are that go on inside living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. We're coming at it with two 
              and a half or three prongs. At one level we're trying to build robots 
              that have properties of living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that robots haven't had before. 
              We're trying to build robots that can repair themselves, that can 
              reproduce (although we're a long way from self-reproduction), that 
              have metabolism, and that have to go out and seek <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to maintain 
              themselves. We're trying to design robots that are not built out 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> steel, but out of materials that are not as rigid or 
              as regular as traditional materials -- that are more like what we're 
              built out of. Our theme phrase is that we're going to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> 
              out of Jello. We don't really mean we're actually going to use Jello, 
              but that's the image we have in our <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. We are trying to figure 
              out how we could build a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> out of "mushy" stuff and 
              still have it be a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that interacts in the world.</p>
<p>The second direction we're going is building large-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s. People might call them simulations, but since we're 
              not necessarily simulating anything real I prefer to call them <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s. 
              We're looking at a range of questions on living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. One student, 
              for example, is looking at how multi-cellular reproduction can arise 
              from single-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> reproduction. When you step back a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> you 
              can understand how single-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> reproduction works, but then how 
              did that turn into multi-cellular reproduction, which at one level 
              of organization looks very different from what's happening in the 
              single-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> reproduction. In single-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> reproduction one thing 
              gets bigger and then just breaks into two; in multicell reproduction 
              you're actually building different sorts of cells. This is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              in speculating about the pre-biotic emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a> 
              in the soup of chemicals that used to be <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. We're trying to 
              figure out how <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a> occured, and how it bootstraped 
              Darwinian <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, etc. out of that. The current dogma is 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> is central. But maybe <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> came along a lot later as a regulatory 
              mechanism. </p>
<p>In other <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s we're looking at very simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s and modeling their neural development. We're looking at 
              polyclad flatworms, which have a very primitive, but very adaptable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with a couple of thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. If you take a polyclad 
              flatworm and cut out its <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, it doesn't carry out all of its 
              usual behaviors but it can still survive. If you then get a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              from another one and you put it into this brainless flatworm, after 
              a few days it can carry out all of its behaviors pretty well. If 
              you take a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from another one and you turn it about 180 degrees 
              and put it in backwards, the flatworm will walk backwards a little 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> for the first few days, but after a few days it will be back 
              to normal with this <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> helping it out. Or you can take a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              and flip it over 180 degrees, and it adapts, and regrows. How is

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The idea that there may be something that can not be graspable using the general cognitive tools that define our current era is always refreshing. It implies a clear invitation to conceive of new ones, beyond our contemporary certainties. One of the characteristics of the "computational approach" that always struck me as reductionist was the emphasis that it puts on defining intelligence purely in terms of "problems solving". Of course, from an evolutionary point of view, intelligence has demostrated its essential problem solving qualities, but it is also interesting to point out that, as evolution has increased the complexity of primate brains, it has left the infants of each species less able to solve their most basic needs and to fend for themselves. While evolution allowed a more open, less fixated behavioural patterns to apes, it also made the learning years of each individual a more diffuse, playful period, with less rate of succes in each specific task than that of a turtle or a frog. Infant primates, to put it in clear terms, are less able to solve problems related to their survival than new born turtles. Their unability is inversely proportional to their learning potential, their tendency to freely asociate patterns and their restless need of play. I wonder if we shouldn't think of intelligent computers in the same terms: as primitive infants, not only ignoring how to solve their problems but also ignoring what those problems may be. A computer with the ability to asociate two apparently unrelated "memories", with no particular emphasis on solving any "problem" should maybe be considered much more intelligent that one that can learn to predict the behaviour of some vectors.</p></td>
