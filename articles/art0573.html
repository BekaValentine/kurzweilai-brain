<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>Barings Bank was founded in 1762. In its long <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> it helped 
              to finance the Louisiana Purchase (providing money Napoleon needed 
              to keep fighting his wars), and counted the Queen among its loyal 
              customers. In January of 1995 a twenty-eight-year-old trader for 
              Barings in Singapore, Nick Leeson, lost most of what eventually 
              proved to be $1.4 billion by trading <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s in the Japanese Nikkei 
              Index. That was twice the bank's available capital; by February 
              the bank had folded, and in March it was sold to the Dutch bank 
              ING for &#163;1.</p>
<p>In July of that same year, Toshihide Iguchi, a trader for Daiwa 
              Bank in New York, confessed to the bank that he had lost $1.1 billion 
              trading apparently harmless U.S. Treasury securities. By November 
              Daiwa was forced out of the United States for concealing the losses.</p>
<p>The next year Yasuo Hamanaka, a copper trader for Sumitomo, dwarfed 
              these scandals by admitting to having lost $2.6 billion in copper 
              trading. In the preceding years he had single-handedly kept the 
              copper market artificially inflated, leading to the digging of unnecessary 
              new mines and a subsequent glut of copper. After his manipulations 
              were revealed the price collapsed by 25 percent.</p>
<p>Losing large sums of money no longer requires even the specialized 
              skills of a rogue trader; Robert Citron, the duly elected treasurer 
              of Orange County, California, lost $1.7 billion by investing in 
              derivatives. This led to the largest municipal default in U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, 
              by one of its richest counties, no less than the birthplace of Richard 
              Nixon.</p>
<p>As quickly as enormous amounts of money are vanishing into economic 
              thin air they are reappearing elsewhere. Markets are valuing bits 
              far more than atoms. In 1997 U.S. Steel had twenty thousand employees, 
              sales of $6.8 billion, and assets of $6.7 billion. The total value 
              of U.S. Steel stock was $2.9 billion. Last year <a class="thought" href="entries/yahoo_entry.html">Yahoo</a>, the company 
              with the popular <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> index site, had just 155 employees, sales 
              of $67 million, and assets of $125 million. But the total value 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/yahoo_entry.html">Yahoo</a> stock was about the same as U.S. Steel, $2.8 billion. <a class="thought" href="entries/netscape_entry.html">Netscape</a> 
              already had kicked off the frenzy of public offerings of stock in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> companies, with a first day of trading that brought the 
              net worth of the company to $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>The market's conversion rate between atoms and bits has been running 
              at about ten to one. The stock market values Ford and GM&#8212;which 
              together have a million employees and assets of $500 billion&amp;#8212at 
              $100 billion. The stock for <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> and Intel, which jointly have 
              about a hundred thousand employees and assets of $50 billion, is 
              worth $300 billion.</p>
<p>The distribution of this new <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> is distinctly uneven. According 
              to the Census Bureau, in 1968 in the United States the top 5 percent 
              of households received 16.6 percent of the total household income; 
              by 1994 that had climbed to 21.2 percent. Similar redistributions 
              are happening globally: World Bank <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s show that poor- and medium-income 
              countries held 23 percent of the world's <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> in 1980, dropping 
              to 18 percent eight years later.</p>
<p>There's something happening here. The economy appears to be divorced 
              from the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, creating and eliminating great <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> 
              with little apparent connection to the material world. And that 
              is exactly the case: money is increasingly <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> 
              circulating in global <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> economy is weaving 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and physical worlds together faster than anything else. 
              The demand for more sophisticated ways to manipulate money is forcing 
              computing to go where money goes, whether in a trader's workstation, 
              a smart card in a wallet, or a <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> vending <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>Freeing money from its legacy as a tangible asset carries with 
              it great promise to make the economy more <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible to more people, 
              but we'll be in trouble if we continue to act as if money is worth 
              something. The bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> cash still retain a vestigial 
              reflection of their origin in the atoms of scarce resources.</p>
<p>Just after World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement fixed a conversion 
              rate between dollars and gold at $35 an ounce, and in turn <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> exchange 
              rates between the dollar and other currencies. The U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> 
              was obligated to convert dollars into gold upon request, using the 
              cache held at Fort Knox. In 1971, saddled with a dwindling gold 
              supply, a persistent recession, and an expensive war in Vietnam, 
              President Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard. Since then, 
              the value of currencies has been fixed solely by what the markets 
              think they are worth. We maintain a polite fiction that money stands 
              for a valuable commodity, but it now represents nothing more than 
              beliefs.</p>
<p>The implications of the end of the gold standard reach far beyond 
              the passionate debates of that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, because of an apparently unrelated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that was quietly happening in a handful of laboratories: in 
              1971 the ARPANET entered into regular service. This was a project 
              supported by the U.S. Defense Department Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects 
              Agency (<a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a>) to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> that had no central 
              control and multiple ways to route messages, just the thing to survive 
              a nuclear attack. In 1971 it had all of fifteen host <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Its 
              original <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> function was soon forgotten as the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> filled 
              with people sending e-mail, and connecting more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. With 
              millions of hosts on it by 1989, <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> gave up on trying to manage 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> was born.</p>
<p>At the end of the gold standard, computing was done by relatively 
              isolated <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s; <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were needed to record financial trends 
              but did not create them. With the arrival of instantaneous global 
              connectivity and <a class="thought" href="entries/distributed_computing_entry.html">distributed computing</a>, money can now travel at 
              the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, anywhere, anytime, changing its very <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. 
              The only physical difference between a million and a billion <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              dollars is the storage of ten extra bits to fit the zeros; money 
              has become one more kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>The apparent function of money is clear. It has a transferable 
              value; I can exchange a dollar bill for a carton of milk because 
              the grocer can then exchange the dollar for something else of comparable 
              value. An <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> representation alone does not change this. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> money has been around for years in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              funds transfers done by financial institutions, transactions that 
              differ in scale but not in kind from buying milk. They could in 
              principle be done equally well by moving around (very) large amounts 
              of physical currency. The spread of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> has now brought 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> commerce into the home. The grocer can send a <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> describing the milk to your Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>, and you can send 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> back to the grocer with your credit card <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>There's a popular misconception that it is dangerous to transmit 
              a credit card <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> over the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. This dates back to the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              when <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> traffic was not encrypted, so that a malicious or even 
              just curious person with the right <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> could connect to a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> 
              and read the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s sailing by. This was an eavesdropper's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, because the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> came to you instead of your having to go 
              to it. Although I've had taxi drivers lecture me on the dangers 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> now is that there are solid cryptographic 
              protocols that make this kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> sniffing impossible. In 
              a "public-key" cryptosystem you can openly advertise an ID much 
              like a phone <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> that lets people easily encode a message before 
              sending it to you, but that makes it impossible for anyone other 
              than you to decode it unless they know your secret key associated 
              with the public key. This can be done by using what are called secure 
              socket <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> protocols, built into most Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>s.</p>
<p>Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a> goes much further, splitting hairs that you 
              might not have realized you had. If you don't trust the grocer, 
              a "zero-<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> proof" lets you give the grocer enough <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              to be able to bill you without letting the grocer learn either who 
              you are (so you don't have to worry about getting junk mail) or 
              what your account is (so you don't have to worry about later unauthorized 
              charges). Conversely, by using a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> signature, the grocer can 
              prove that an advertisement came from the store and not someone 
              trying to spoof store business. <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> certificates permit a 
              third party whom you trust to remotely vouch for the grocer's reliability 
              before you sign a contract for milk delivery.</p>
<p>Smart cards build these cryptographic capabilities into your wallet 
              instead of your Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>. A smart card looks like a credit card 
              but acts like a dollar bill. A <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> in the card stores <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              money that can be spent directly, unlike the account <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> stored 
              in a credit card that needs <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a central <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to be used. 
              The first widespread use of smart cards came in pay phones in Europe, 
              where they eliminated the need to fumble through a Pocket-of-Babel's 
              worth of change to make a local phone call. They're now expanding 
              into retailing so that both buyers and sellers can stop carting 
              around currency.</p>
<p>After all, what could be more useless than a penny? They travel 
              between bowls on shop counters and jars on bureaus because it's 
              too much trouble to take them back to the bank. There's a solid 
              economic argument that the net cost of handling pennies exceeds 
              their worth, therefore they should be eliminated as the smallest 
              currency unit. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of the penny does not look bright.</p>
<p>Qualify that: the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of a <i>physical</i> penny does not look 
              bright. The value of <i><a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a></i> pennies is just beginning 
              to be appreciated. On the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> representing 
              financial exchanges are a drop in the bucket compared to high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> such as video. There's plenty of room to send much more of 
              them. The total amount of money in circulation can't go up, but 
              the size of a transaction can certainly go down. The overhead in 
              selling a product sets a floor on what people are willing to purchase. 
              Either you buy a CD, or you don't. If, however, the CD arrives as 
              bits on the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, you could pay for it a track at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Rather 
              than buying an expensive <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a> cartridge, you could be billed 
              for each level of the game as you play it. Your taxes that pay for 
              garbage collection, or highway maintenance, could be collected each 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you take out the trash or drive your car. The incentive for 
              a consumer to consider buying this way is to be able pay for just 
              what gets used rather than paying in advance for the expected lifetime 
              cost of something. The advantage for a merchant is the opening up 
              of new markets by decreasing initial purchase costs, the ongoing 
              revenue stream, and the detailed and continuous usage <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              that gets provided (if the buyer agrees to make that available).</p>
<p>As interesting as it is to introduce micropayments and <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a> 
              into commerce, these are just ways to repackage our old model of 
              money, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to your buying milk in lots of tiny containers, 
              or visiting the store with a paper bag over your head to protect 
              your <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> representations of old <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> start 
              out by emulating their functionality and then later generalize beyond 
              the hidden assumptions. For example, the first formats for <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              pictures stored an array of intensities to match each part of an 
              image, before people realized that a picture could be stored in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance so that transmitting a small amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> 
              provides enough <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to produce a small image that can be 
              refined as more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is received, or identifying <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> can 
              be hidden in the image to catch forgery, or the parts of a picture 
              can be encoded separately so that they can later be rearranged. 
              The familiar notion of a picture has grown to encompass many new 
              functions. Likewise, moving money as bits instead of atoms creates 
              an opportunity to expand its <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> far beyond the familiar forms 
              that it has taken in the long <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of commerce.</p>
<p>Each day, over a trillion dollars circulates in the global currency 
              market. That's a lot of money. The bulk of this activity has nothing 
              to do with getting francs for a trip to Paris; it is a massive hunt 
              for profit and security in the inefficiencies of the market. Now 
              this is very different from buying a gallon of milk. There is no 
              intention to use what is bought or sold; the real <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of a currency 
              trade is the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that motivates it. What's being exchanged 
              are opinions about whether the yen is overvalued, say, or whether 
              the Fed will lower interest rates. Financial speculation isn't a 
              new idea, but the size is. The sums need to be so vast because the 
              trades are exploiting minuscule differences in the value of currencies 
              that show up only on the scale of a national economy. And they can 
              be so big because the combination of an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> representation 
              of money with a global <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> makes taking a $100 million 
              foreign exchange position no more difficult than sending an e-mail 
              message.</p>
<p>The dollars used in a large financial trade have a very different 
              character from the dollars used to buy a gallon of milk, but we 
              continue to presume that they are identical. The dollars that you 
              use to purchase milk are useful in small quantities, and essentially 
              all of their value goes into paying for the milk (there's just a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of extra demographic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that the seller can collect 
              about where and when you bought the milk). The dollars that a trader 
              uses are useful only in big quantities because of the small margins 
              and the large minimum size of the trades, and there's no desire 
              to actually use what is being bought. This distinction can be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              of as <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-dollars and <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>-dollars.</p>
<p>People, and countries, that don't have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>-dollars are 
              increasingly being left behind, unable to compete in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly 
              accelerated economy. The corner grocer has to move a lifetime of 
              milk to match the resources committed by a few keystrokes on any 
              trader's keyboard. And people who can participate in the new economy 
              are seeing bigger and faster swings between spectacular riches and 
              ruin because normal economic fluctuations can be magnified almost 
              impossibly large.</p>
<p>Just as it was once <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that printed dollars needed to be backed 
              up by a gold standard, we now assume that <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>-dollars must be interchangeable 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-dollars. The end of the gold standard was an economic 
              leap of faith that remains controversial, but it arguably is what 
              enabled the rapid ensuing economic development in many parts of 
              the world. Now, given the spread of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representation 
              for money, the conversion between <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and tangible assets 
              can depend on the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of a transaction. It's possible to end 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> standard.</p>
<p>We already accept that the grocer cannot receive a dollar for a 
              carton of milk and then directly exchange it for a currency position, 
              because of the large minimums and rules for foreign exchange market 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>. The converse would be to have $1 million made in a currency 
              transaction buy something less than a million gallons of milk. This 
              could be <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed by making the value of a dollar depend on its 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. Its purchasing power could vary based on how many dollars 
              it was earned with and then how many dollars it is being spent with.</p>
<p>The $1 million earned in a trade could still buy a million-dollar 
              dairy, but for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> purchases at the corner market it would 
              be worth less than dollars that had been earned more slowly in smaller 
              quantities. Such a scaling is not a simple devaluation or transfer 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> from the rich to the poor; it's a recognition that the 
              money is being used in entirely different ways and it is not at 
              all obvious that the conversion factor should be one-to-one. Considering 
              such a change raises enormous economic, political, and social questions, 
              but now that it is technically possible to do it, choosing not to 
              is itself an even more significant decision.</p>
<p>There's a precedent for valuing something based on a rule that 
              depends on its <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>: that's what derivatives do, the new financial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s that are now so painfully familiar to Orange County. 
              A derivative sets a price based on the behavior over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of an 
              asset, rather than the worth of the underlying asset itself. For 
              example, an option could be designed that would pay off if the activity 
              in a given market increases, regardless of which way the market 
              moves. These <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s were developed because the markets are 
              so random that it is all but nonsensical to forecast the daily values 
              but quite <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able to forecast changes in <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s such as the 
              volume of trades. What's interesting about options is this introduction 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s to the price of something, so that value can be associated 
              with change.</p>
<p>Derivatives themselves are not dangerous. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that they 
              are associated with so many billion dollar boo-boos is that it's 
              not possible to assess their present worth, or your vulnerability 
              to changes in the market, simply by tallying up an account balance. 
              In a financial firm the traders are at the top of the pecking <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, 
              surrounded by the most advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> analysis techniques 
              to guide and make trades. Then there's a risk assessment group that 
              trails after them trying to determine the firm's exposure to risk. 
              The latter is generally a sleepy enterprise located far from the 
              trading floor, lacking the tools of the former. This imbalance is 
              a recipe for disaster, because committing resources to a position 
              is easy compared to evaluating the financial risk of a portfolio 
              of derivatives, which requires a detailed understanding of the state 
              of the markets and how they are likely to move. In this unequal 
              competition, the trading side almost always wins out over the risk 
              assessment side. Some firms effectively give up and ask the traders 
              to evaluate themselves. Tellingly, Leeson at Barings, and Iguchi 
              at Daiwa, both kept their own books because their managers from 
              an earlier generation did not feel capable of supervising them.</p>
<p>The solution is to recognize that the further that assets get divorced 
              from underlying resources, the more necessary it becomes to <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> 
              spending with monitoring. Each new <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> for valuing something 
              must be mated to a new <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> for assessing it. Back-end accounting 
              then moves to the front lines, drawing on the same <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> feeds and 
              mathematical models that are used for trading. Too many people still 
              think of smart money in dumb terms, assuming that like gold bars 
              it has an intrinsic worth that won't change very much if you look 
              away from it. Understanding the implications of a derivative outstrips 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, particularly as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, instead of people, increasingly 
              initiate trades. Since physicists have spent centuries trying with 
              limited success to understand the behavior of complex interacting 
              random <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, it's too much to expect one trader to be able to 
              do so (the physicists on Wall Street certainly haven't been able 
              to). The money must do a better job of supervising itself. This 
              is a cultural problem more than a technological one, requiring an 
              acceptance that the bits representing money should come packaged 
              with bits representing <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s for tracking their worth.</p>
<p>Stepping back to recognize that it is more natural to view <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              money as comprising the combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> describing quantity 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s specifying valuation, it then becomes possible to 
              create combinations that are useful for purposes far from high finance. 
              Think what could happen if e&#173;cash contained the means for ordinary 
              people to add rules. A child's allowance might be paid in dollars 
              that gain value based on the stability of the child's account balance, 
              to make the benefits of saving apparent in the short term instead 
              of just through the long-term accrual of interest. Or a store's 
              price guarantee could be <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed by pricing an item in dollars 
              that stay active after the transaction, and that have a value derived 
              from the market for that item. You don't need to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for the 
              lowest price; the money can. If a competing car dealer lowers the 
              price on a car the day after you bought one at another dealer across 
              town, that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can automatically initiate a transfer between 
              your dealer's bank account and yours to refund the difference. The 
              dealer gets your business if it thinks it can always beat the competition; 
              you get the <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> from worrying about finding the best deal.</p>
<p>If money can contain <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s then this kind of oversight could 
              be built into every transaction rather than being a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of fiscal 
              policy alone. Central banks have just a few coarse levers with which 
              to manage a nation's economy, primarily controlling the prime interest 
              rate that the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> charges banks. If it's low, new money gets 
              printed at less than its real worth, in effect making a loan from 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to the present. That may be a good idea in a depression, 
              but otherwise it saddles your children with your debt. If the rate 
              is high, then money costs too much and people are forced to sacrifice 
              now for the sake of saving for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. This one <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> applies 
              to everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p>Once money is manipulated by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, then it can be personalized 
              to reflect both national and local interests. Dollars could have 
              a latency period when they're not valid after transactions, to slow 
              down panic spending. In a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of economic turmoil this would mean 
              that you might have to wait a day after withdrawing your <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> savings 
              from a bank before you could put all the money into a get-rich-quick 
              scheme. To encourage regional economies, dollars could have a value 
              that decreases with distance from their origin. Boston dollars would 
              not go as far in Texas, and vice versa. Or, to reflect true environmental 
              costs, dollars might be worth less when purchasing nonrenewable 
              resources than renewable ones. These are not <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s to be settled 
              once for everyone everywhere; they are dynamic decisions to be made 
              by buyers and sellers on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Such goals are currently <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed by familiar mechanisms such 
              as tax policies and sales contracts, without needing something so 
              ambitious as a redefinition of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of money. But as the money, 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about how the money can be and is being spent, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s of economic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> running around <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, 
              the distinction between the money and the supporting <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              becomes less and less meaningful, until it becomes simpler to recognize 
              the financial <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a> as a new definition of money.</p>
<p>Just like any other <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, for this to succeed there must 
              be a vigorous community of money developers working with open standards. 
              If any economic or technological lesson has been learned over the 
              last few hundred years, it's that central planning cannot substitute 
              for the creative anarchy of relatively free markets. It would be 
              a shame if the dollar bill had to relearn all of the mistakes of 
              previous <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> standards, which have a nasty habit of rediscovering 
              old errors and not anticipating <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s started out using 16-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> addresses to identify 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> locations. This is enough to use 65,536 addresses, which 
              at one <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> seemed unlimited. As <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> both expanded 
              beyond this boundary, awkward patches were needed to use some of 
              the precious addresses to point to other blocks of addresses that 
              could be swapped in and out as needed. Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of address 
              bits was fixed by the <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>, this problem continued to 
              recur long after it was clear that sixteen bits wasn't adequate. 
              Similarly, most every <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> standard (including the IP protocol 
              that runs the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>) has run out of addresses and needs a redesign. 
              The solution to this problem of lack of foresight is not better 
              foresight, it is more humility. Since it's not possible to anticipate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, standards are increasingly designed to let independent 
              developers add new capabilities. One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> game 
              Doom has been so popular is that the authors released it with a 
              specification that lets other people add new worlds and new capabilities 
              to it. There's a lively little industry that has grown up around 
              the game, continually reinventing it in a way that one team of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers 
              alone could never do.</p>
<p>Opening up fiscal policy to the people who brought us Doom is admittedly 
              a terrifying prospect, but it's instructive to compare the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and Bitnet. In the dark ages of computing one didn't 
              send e-mail, one "sent a Bitnet." The Bitnet was an international 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s organized along the line of the Soviet economy 
              with central planning and management; the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> was (and still 
              is) a relatively anarchic collection of distributed <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es and 
              collectively supported evolving protocols. Guess which one survived? 
              Bitnet was shut down in 1996, a centralized monoculture that could 
              not keep up with the frenetic <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and distributed innovation 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. Even with the occasional glitches, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 
              is perhaps the largest and most reliable <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> ever constructed, 
              precisely because there is no central location to fail or mismanage 
              and so many people can contribute to its development.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of computing is littered with unsuccessful standards 
              that sought reliability through specification rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              When the car companies and other heavy industries wanted to install 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s in their factories they decided that what everyone 
              else was using was not reliable enough, so they came up with their 
              own standard that was supposed to be foolproof. They now use the 
              open standards for <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ing that everyone else does. They found 
              that reliability depends much more on having a diverse community 
              working on developing and deploying the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s than on trying 
              to control their design. As a result, <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is now distributed 
              throughout factories rather than being centralized in a few <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              or people.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many bad standards that have been very successful 
              because they came along at the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. If a standard gets specified 
              too soon, it reflects early ignorance rather than useful <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              If it comes too late, it's irrelevant no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how good it is. 
              In between is a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when a standard appears too soon to really 
              know how to write it well, but soon enough to be able to have an 
              impact. <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a>, the protocol for connecting <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, 
              is a good example of a bad standard (because it can't scale up to 
              handle installations larger than what was originally envisioned), 
              but it arrived at just the right moment to create a new industry. 
              You can hear the result in almost any popular <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> recording.</p>
<p>The economy is now ready for something similar. Just as technological 
              improvements in the tools to create sounds or send messages have 
              led to a transformation of our notion of what it means to make <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> 
              or interact with others, the increasing manipulation of money by 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s rather than people presents an opportunity to transform 
              the global economy to better reflect personal needs. It's not yet 
              clear exactly how to write an open standard for smart money that 
              merges value with behavior, but markets are already doing this imperfectly, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> provides strong guidance for how to go about creating 
              standards for reliable, scalable, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. These are increasingly 
              questions for <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers, not economists.</p>
<p>Commerce is where the physical world and the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world will 
              always meet. A purchase must become embodied to be usable. As <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> appears in more and more of those transactions, it is 
              essential that money be freed to complete its journey from a tangible 
              asset to a virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>. Buying and selling is increasingly mediated 
              by smart <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that still use dumb money. Abstracting money from 
              its legacy as a thing will make it easier for still smarter things 
              to manipulate it, helping them better act on our desires.</p>
