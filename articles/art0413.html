            thinks he won't. </i>
<p>Mitchell's essay provides a thorough and concise statement of the 
              classic arguments against the likelihood of Turing-level <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              in a several decade timeframe. Mitch ends with a nice compliment 
              comparing me to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, and I only wish that it were true. 
              I think of all the books and web sites I'd like to read, and of 
              all the people I'd like to dialog and interact with, and I realize 
              just how limited my current <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> and attention span is with 
              my mere hundred trillion connections.</p>
<p>I discussed several of Mitchell's insightful <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ions in my statement, 
              and augment these observations here:</p>
<p>"We are embodied creatures": True, but <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will 
              have bodies also, in both real and <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>.</p>
<p>"Emotion is as or more <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> than cognition": Yes, I 
              agree. As I discussed, our ability to perceive and respond appropriately 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> is the most complex thing that we do. Understanding our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will be the primary target of our reverse 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering efforts. There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that we cannot understand 
              our own <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s and the complex <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that gives rise 
              to them. We've already demonstrated the feasibility of understanding 
              regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> in great detail.</p>
<p>"We are conscious beings, capable of reflection and self-awareness." 
              I think we have to distinguish the performance aspects of what is 
              commonly called <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> (i.e., the ability to be reflective 
              and aware of ourselves) versus <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as the ultimate ontological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is a test of performance, it is the 
              performance aspects of what is commonly referred to as <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              that we are concerned with here. And in this regard, our ability 
              to build models of ourselves and our relation to others and the 
              environment is indeed a subtle and complex quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. 
              However there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> would 
              be restricted from similarly building comparable models in its <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>Mitchell cites the limitations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology 
              and I agree with this. A lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> criticism is really criticism 
              of this approach. The core strength of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is not 
              logical analysis of rules, but rather <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, which 
              requires a completely different <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. This pertains also to 
              Mitchell's <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion to the "metaphor" of "brain-as-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>." 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that I envision will not be like the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              of today, but will be <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired and will be emulating 
              the massively parallel, self-organizing, holographically organized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s that are used in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> certainly 
              won't be using <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> techniques. Rather, it will be a complex 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, each built with a different <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology, just 
              like, well, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>I will say that Mitchell is overlooking the hundreds of ways in 
              which "narrow AI" has infiltrated our contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">Expert system</a>s are not the best example of these, and I cited several 
              categories in my statement.</p>
<p>I agree with Mitchell that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does not represent the entirety 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process, but it does represent the bulk of it. In 
              particular, the endocrine <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is orders of magnitude simpler 
              and operates at very low <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> compared to neural processes 
              (which themselves utilize a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing 
              dramatically slower than contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s).</p>
<p>Mitchell expresses skepticism that "it's all about the bits 
              and just the bits." There is something going on in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and these processes are not hidden from us. I agree that 
              it's actually not exactly bits because what we've already learned 
              is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> uses <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. We know 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s can be emulated by <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s but there 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s to prefer <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> techniques because they 
              are more efficient by several orders of magnitude. However, the 
              work of Cal Tech Professor <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a> and others have shown that 
              we can use this approach in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Again, this is different 
              from today's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, but will be, I believe, an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              trend.</p>
<p>However, I think Mitchell's primary point here is not to distinguish 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, but to make reference to some 
              other kind of "stuff" that we inherently can't recreate 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. I believe, however, that the scale of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> nervous 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> (and, yes, the endocrine <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, although as I said this 
              adds little additional <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>) is sufficient to explain the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and subtlety of our behavior.</p>
<p>I think the most compelling argument that Mitchell offers is his 
              insight that most <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> is not book <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. I agree, but 
              point out that one of the primary purposes of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is to interact with us humans. So embodied <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s will have plenty 
              of opportunity to learn from direct interaction with their <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              progenitors, as well as to observe a massive quantity of other full 
              immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> interaction available over the web.</p>
<p>Now it's true that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s will have a different <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> from humans, 
              and that does represent an additional challenge to their passing 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. As I pointed out in my statement, it's harder (even 
              for humans) to successfully defend a fictional <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> than a real 
              one. So an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will actually need to surpass native <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to pass for a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> in a valid <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. And that's 
              what I'm betting on.</p>
<p>I can imagine Mitchell saying to himself as he reads this "But 
              does Ray really appreciate the extraordinary depth of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intellect 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>?" I believe that I do and think that Mitchell has 
              done an excellent job of articulating this perspective. I would 
              put the question back and ask whether Mitchell really appreciates 
              the extraordinary power and depth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that lies ahead, 
              which will be billions of times more powerful and complex than what 
              we have today?</p>
<p>On that note, I would end by emphasizing the accelerating pace 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in all of these <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies. The 
              power of these technologies is doubling every year, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              shift rate is doubling every decade, so the next thirty years will 
              be like 140 years at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. And the past 140 
              years was comparable to only about 30 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's 
              rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> because we've been accelerating up to this point. 
              If one really absorbs the implications of what I call the law of 
              accelerating returns, then it becomes apparent that over the next 
              three decades (well, 28 years to be exact when Mitchell and I sit 
              down to compare notes), we will see astonishing levels of technological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>In their debate over who will win the proposed Turing Test, Ray says: "I think the most compelling argument that Mitchell offers is his insight that most experience is not book learning. I agree, but point out that one of the primary purposes of nonbiological intelligence is to interact with us humans. So embodied AI's will have plenty of opportunity to learn from direct interaction with their human progenitors, as well as to observe a massive quantity of other full immersion human interaction available over the web."
<br>
<br>
I expect that a non-human entity will be able to pass the Turing Test well before 2029. I use the term non-human entity instead of computer because the being that passes the test will be much more than what we think of today as a computer. It will be an amalgam of artifical intelligence, robot, and distributed network. 
<br>
<br>
A key factor that Ray did not mention is that this embodied AI will learn not only from "direct interaction with" humans and "full immersion human interaction available over the web", but also from its own subjective experience of being in the world. It will have the ability to independently sense the difference between hot and cold, wet and dry, loud and soft, bright and dark, gentle and rough, polite and rude. 
<br>
<br>
In many ways these entities will be like human children discovering the world anew and with their own unique perspective. The act of cataloging such experiences and developing patterns of recognition, reaction, and response may in fact result in a kind of emotion. I look forward to getting to know some of these new creatures and becoming friends with them.

<br>
<br>
You _can_ reverse engineering the human playing. But you can also let the program to calculate deep in the position. Much deeper than any human can. And it will win, provided it has enough CPU power and RAM storage. Accumulating the old knowledge, what to play in certain circumstances, is the matter of experience. A lot of computing power can give you a billion of games played and analyzed every second.
<br>
<br>
For example, a simple program can always win with two bishops and the king against the king and two knights. No human can.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Raw computing power just means that it can churn through those algorithms fast enough 
<br>
<br>
Again - chess rules and enough computing power beats every Kasparov. The question is, if the entire computing power on the Earth today is enough for that - but sooner or later - it will be.
<br>
<br>
&gt; If I put a 100 terrahertz processor in my computer, it won't start beating chess masters all of a sudden.
<br>
<br>
Give him enough storage capacity and time to render out good moves for many position. You gave that to Kasparov and humanity.
<br>
<br>
&gt; If you add a few Gigahertz here or megahertz there, it won't do anything to improve the chess-playing ability
<br>
<br>
Of course it will! The program will scan deeper. It's ALL about that. ALL.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Again, if I upgrade my processor in my computer, it won't figure out how to manage memory more efficiently
<br>
<br>
To a certain level it will. Better caching. But RAM will be improved also.
<br>
<br>
&gt; it won't figure out how to stop itself from crashing, 
<br>
<br>
Don't count much on this. Newer OS crashes less often.
<br>
<br>
&gt; and it won't figure out that I hate the damn Clippy icon in Microsoft Word. 
<br>
<br>
Clippy may be stupid - I wouldn't know. But maybe your hate has nothing to do with that.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Only when the power of the CPU is harnessed, with better software, will improvements be made.
<br>
<br>
Not _only_. Sometimes additional CPU makes a big difference. 
<br>
<br>
&gt; How will the programs do that? 
<br>
<br>
So called genetic (evolutionary) algorithm can improve almost everything. It needs as much CPU as possible. And memory. And bandwidth. And nothing else.
<br>
<br>
&gt; We have to write the programs that "take the lead". 
<br>
<br>
Sometimes is better to wait for something to evolve inside computer. More and more often.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Until we have those programs, raw CPU power is meaningless from an AI standpoint.
<br>
<br>
We already have. John Koza ... and others.
<br>
<br>
&gt; if we look at the trends and say "computers will become intelligent on their own...look at those exponential curves!" we're kidding ourselves.
<br>
<br>
Of course. But from a certain point on ... it will happen. Puberty of our software is close.

<br>
<br>
*How*, exactly, does the computer learn how to calculate chess moves?  The CPU doesn't teach itself.  There are no chess "rules", that when followed, result in a win every time.  If you find that kind of rule set, let me know, we could make a lot of money.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, a simple program can always win with two bishops and the king against the king and two knights. No human can.
<br>
<br>
That is blatantly a false statement.  Any combination of moves a computer can carry out, a human can.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you add a few Gigahertz here or megahertz there, it won't do anything to improve the chess-playing ability 
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course it will! The program will scan deeper. It's ALL about that. ALL. 
<br>
<br>
OK, a faster computer will be able to scan more moves in the same amount of time.  But lets say we allow a slower computer to run for a longer amount to time, so that the total number of calculations evens out.  Both computers (slow and fast) will come up with the same moves.
<br>
<br>
Why can't we apply this to other types of artificial intelligence?  Why can't I have an incredibly slow conversation with my computer?  The answer is that we don't have any clue how to program computers to do that, and no amount of processing power will change that.  Processing power may be an "enabling technology", but we still need a breakthrough in software.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only when the power of the CPU is harnessed, with better software, will improvements be made. 
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Not _only_. Sometimes additional CPU makes a big difference. 
<br>
<br>
Stating your thesis over and over doesn't convince me of its validity.

&gt; *How*, exactly, does the computer learn how to calculate chess moves? 
<br>
<br>
One example: 
<br>
<br>
- program R0 picks a random (legal) move.
<br>
<br>
You can imagine, that two random - R0 - programs can play with each other. 
<br>
<br>
Program R1 CHECKS every next move only by how good is the potential move in a number of R0 - R0 games.
<br>
<br>
In another words: R1 will open (select one of possible 20 initial moves) by looking what move is usually the best in a hundredth R0 - R0 games from the initial move on.
<br>
<br>
Not only open - but calculate every move that way. We have R1 strategy now, which is better than R0.
<br>
<br>
R2 can be defined same way. After enough steps we have a powerful program RN, which pumps it's strength out of massive CPU calculation.
<br>
<br>
Do you understand this?

Try actually writing this program.  You will quickly find that the most difficult part will be this "checking" algorithm, that decides which move is "usually best".  *That* is where the intelligence of the program lies.  The CPU power may allow you to use more complex algorithms and heuristics for doing that, but it won't write those algorithms and heuristics for you.</p></td>

The principle is the same for a large variety of games. Including chess.

Not at all! It is very easy. You just have to calculate which moves (of about 30) has the best wining (nonloosing) record.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Actually, the previous poster is right, to a point! The evaluation function is still a matter of art and guesswork. However, if there is a computer built that will go 20 plys deep at any stage of the game, it will beat any human. Even if the evaluation function is simple. Better yet, program a typical opening book into a machine and put variable weighting on a list of criteria for good play: knight distance from the center, number of open ranks for rooks, diagonals for bishops, passed pawns, minimizing possible moves by opposing player, etc. Then feed in the thousands of Grandmaster games on record, and let the program finish the drawn games, adjusting the weighting all the while! The first chess programs were very bad, and people felt that chess was exclusively the domain of intelligent human experts. But programmers gradually extracted and emulated "mechanizable" components to chess play until there was very little art and judgment left over. Garry Kasparov made a minor but well known(to grandmasters) mistake and just resigned because he knew he didn't have enough art and judgment left over to overcome the brute force power of Deep Blue. I expect that *all* tasks requiring art and judgment will have a sufficient proportion of mechanizable elements to be capably performed by computers.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The Turing Test, while i do think it was a milestone in AI, is antiquated. The point of the Turing Test is to make a machine indistinguishable from a human. Not, as you propose, to make you confused as to which is which. To accomplish making a machine indistinguishable from a human will require that the machine emulate all the imperfections of a human. My question is why would we spend the time to create such a machine? It should suffice to better understand humans at that level without the need to emulate it in a machine.
<br>
<br>
Just as our understanding of the universe has evolved over time, so has our knowledge and understanding of the human mind and so has our knowledge and understanding of computing machines. As knowledge and understand progress, so does (or should) the criteria for how we define that which we, now, more understand. This has not happened with the Turing Test. I think it should.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You underestimate &lt;a href='<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613170200/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover's_algorithm'&gt;Grover's" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover's_algori  thm'&gt;Grover's</a> Algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.
<br>
<br>
It is a general algorithm for turning any "test all possibilities" problem into a 'search algorithm' and reducing the time to compute it to O(N^1/2) instead of the O(N) a normal computer would take.  For example, it solves any NP complete problem in O(N^1/2).
<br>
<br>
As a further example, assume that you have some fitness function that will return 1 for a set of arbitrary inputs that, for example, describe a self-replicating nano-assembler composed of iron, silicon &amp; oxygen, and 0 for any other set of arbitrary inputs.  Assume that you need 10^20 combinations to describe all the iron-silicon-oxygen structures that could produce this machine.  Further assume that it takes 10,000 operations to analyze one configuration for fitness.
<br>
<br>
An ordinary computer running at 1 gigahertz would require 10,000 * 10^20 / 10^9 = 10^15 seconds =~ 30,000,000 years to test all combinations.
<br>
<br>
A 1 megahertz quantum computer running Grover's Algorithm would require 10,000 * 10^10 / 10^6 = 10^8 seconds =~ 3 years to return a correct combination.
<br>
<br>
When you want to find the a satisfactory combination from a boatload of combinations, and you can't find another way to do it that's faster than O(N^1/2), Grover's Algorithm is the way to go.
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that this leads to some very interesting possibilities when the possibility space is very large (10^20 or bigger).</p></td>
