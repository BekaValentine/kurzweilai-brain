<p>Q: You've been involved in speech recognition from an early stage. What are some of the key factors that are making speech systems more widely available? &#160;A: <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> Applied Intelligent Systems was founded in 1982, with the goal of creating a voice-activated <a class="thought" href="entries/word_processor_entry.html">word processor</a>. The grail has been very large vocabulary, <a class="thought" href="entries/speaker_independence_entry.html">speaker independence</a>, and continuous speech. One thing that makes it possible today is <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a>. It's only been in the last six months that we've had PCs that can support the processing requirements of continuous speech. The next step now is to integrate natural-<a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> understanding with continuous speech dictation. People don't want to say "open file" and "close file." They want to say, "Get me the current letter to engineering." It's awkward to go back and forth between different modalities.</p>
<p>
<b>Q: How did you first get involved in speech-recognition </b><b>technology</b><b>?&#160;A:</b> I started with an interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, which was the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> project that I developed to win the Westinghouse <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Award as a high school student. From there, I moved into <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a>. That was a solution in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> of a problem. That's what led me into reading machines for the blind. It combined <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a> and a speech <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>, which took the text from a page that was scanned in and read it out loud in a synthesized voice.</p>
<p>At the time, I had a blind guy who was head of international sales. He traveled all over the world on business for us, but he was limited to reading documents in Braille. But doing print-to-speech opened up any printed document to him.</p>
