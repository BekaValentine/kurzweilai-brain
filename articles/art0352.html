<p>How close is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> to creating something that resembles a human?</p>
<p>There are broadly two levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>). The narrow level is about getting non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> systems to perform activities that require human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> when we perform them. <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">Strong AI</a> is about applying the full range, depth and subtlety of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>We have many examples of narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> today. Machines can diagnose blood cells, guide cruise missiles and play games likes chess better than any human. They can read books and they can understand human speech. In comparison to humans, their memories are more accurate, they are faster and they can share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> instantly by quick downloading. </p>
<p>There are two basic requirements for moving onto the next stage. One is just the brute force <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. Already, we are working on certain <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> technologies that will be a million times more powerful than the human brain, at least in terms of raw <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. But the more important issue is the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. In this regard, the most compelling project underway is one to reverse engineer the human brain, possibly by using billions of tiny high-resolution scanners or nanobots that can travel through capillaries and scan the brain from inside.My feeling is that by 2030, we'll be able to recreate how several hundred regions of the human brain work in non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mediums.</p>
<p>Would that non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> medium then be equivalent to a human?</p>
<p>We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> called a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>--an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> that can communicate wirelessly in two directions with <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> neurons. We also have examples of intelligent machines placed in human brains via neural implants. A treatment for Parkinson's <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a>, pioneered in France by Dr Alim-Louis Benabid replaces the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> cells destroyed in the first seven or eight years of the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. The doctor demonstrated this by controlling the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> from outside: when turned off, the patients remained in an advanced stage of Parkinson's--they were rigid like statues. He flicked a <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>, and it was as if they had suddenly come alive.By 2030, we will be able to send billions of nanobots inside the human brain to communicate wirelessly with billions of different points in the brain. They will give us the ability to combine our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. </p>
<p>Ultimately you will have entities that are completely non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, with copies of human brains derived from <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, and you will have <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humans that have billions or trillions of nanobots in their brains augmenting their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> or enabling them to exist in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. So we will no longer be able to say humans on the left, machines on the right. </p>
