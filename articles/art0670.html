<div class="TeaserText">Lego-style "nanoblocks" could prevent a molecular-assembly fabber from building an atom-precise nanofactory or devices that could help in any attempt to "bootstrap" production of an atom-precise nanofactory, reducing the risk of proliferation of atom-precise MM to "rogue nations" or terrorists.</div>

<p>Those responsible for the safety of a nation&#8212;leaders and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> 
              and police forces&#8212;might be hard pressed to deal with a world 
              in which any <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a> or dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> could be manufactured in 
              large quantities at the press of a button, at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that 
              economic and social norms are being overthrown by rapid change. 
            </p>
<p>We can expect that&amp;#8212by default&amp;#8212authorities will want molecular 
              manufacturing (MM) to be tightly restricted&#8212;kept out of private 
              hands, and limited to the few nations that initially have it. That 
              approach might provide some added security&#8212;or it might simply 
              create such incredible pent-up demand that any barriers and restrictions 
              are quickly overcome by black markets, <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> piracy, 
              rogue-nation <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s to duplicate MM, etc.</p>
<p>This essay attempts to chart a middle path for the early years 
              of MM availability&#8212;one that allows most of the benefits of 
              MM to be widely available to all <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s and nations, while 
              maintaining some control over key <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. I will not go into who 
              will hold that control, other than to suggest the obvious&#8212;that 
              those nations that hold the reins of world power are likely to exercise 
              it to retain power, by delegating it in a controlled fashion to 
              cooperative nations and subordinate authorities.</p>
<p>It is not the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive of this essay to look at radical social 
              changes that might arise due to molecular manufacturing, but rather 
              to see how well MM can fit with existing forms.</p>
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<p><i><a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">Atom</a> Precise</i> - each atom and bond between atoms in an object 
              is as planned in a design. Also used to describe the process or 
              capability of making atom precise objects.</p>
<p><i>Nanoblocks</i> - atom precise constructs with size on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              of 100 nanometers that can be mechanically connected to form larger 
              objects. Each nanoblock would have one or more functions&amp;#8212as 
              simple as providing physical strength and support, or as complex 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>.</p>
<p><i>Fabber</i> - a device that automatically assembles individual 
              products for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> use. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of this essay, it will refer 
              to a device that constructs products out of nanoblocks, specifically 
              excluding atom precise nanofactories - those that build products 
              directly atom-by-atom.</p>
<h4>Technical Advantages of Using Nanoblocks</h4>
<p>Nanoblock-based fabbers will have a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of technical advantages 
              over direct atom precise molecular manufacturing. Even their disadvantages 
              (less precision, lower strength in products) can be considered advantages 
              for purposes of security.</p>
<p>Standardization of nanoblocks&#8212;their modes of interconnection 
              and interaction, their functions, and so on&amp;#8212can greatly simplify 
              the process of designing atom precise products. Use of nanoblocks 
              raises the level of design above the point that requires deep understanding 
              of nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, to the point where anyone could 
              use automated <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> tools to design simple but useful products, 
              and expert engineers could <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably design extremely complex and 
              capable products. For example, there would be no need to re-design 
              a nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> out of individual atoms every time one wished 
              to incorporate <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing into a product, or to re-invent 
              means of digital communication throughout a product.</p>
<p>While the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> expended to form a single atom-to-atom 
              bond and the waste heat generated is tiny, the number of atoms and 
              bonds in a typical finished product for human use is so large that 
              energy and heat issues will be non-trivial when constructing human-scale 
              products. The energy used and heat released to build things out 
              of nanoblocks should be orders of magnitude smaller, as most of 
              the energy is consumed and heat released in the process of making 
              the nanoblocks. Energy supply and heat removal will be much easier 
              for nanoblock fabbers, allowing them to be more compact and operate 
              much faster&#8212;though, of course, they still will need a supply 
              of "raw materials"&amp;#8212a store of nanoblocks rather than 
              whatever atomic or molecular feedstock atom precise nanofactories 
              may use.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nanoblocks needed by a fabber could be made in advance. Energy 
              consumption and heat dissipation would be spread over time, with 
              nanoblocks being stored in the fabber for later quick construction 
              of finished products. Alternatively, nanoblocks could be produced 
              in bulk by centralized nanofactories near convenient energy supplies, 
              to be distributed and sold to owners of fabbers. The energy required 
              to ship a kilogram of nanoblocks, even halfway around the world, 
              should be a fraction of the energy required to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It should be possible to design nanoblocks to allow controlled 
              disassembly&amp;#8212i.e. recycling of products made out of reusable 
              nanoblocks. Each nanoblock could have an ID embedded that specifies 
              its type&amp;#8212reliably sorting nanoblocks would be far more efficient 
              than sorting atoms. This would mean that the energy that goes into 
              producing them would not be wasted when one no longer needs or wants 
              the product they compose. Instead, the unwanted object could be 
              taken apart, and the nanoblocks sorted for re-use in making new 
              objects. This would save energy and avoid the massive production 
              of junk that could result from large-scale use of inexpensive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A related &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Concept')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Concept')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212utility fog&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#8212would be a 
              programmable substance consisting of "foglets." Each &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Foglet')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Foglet')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;foglet&lt;/a&gt; 
              would be a tiny simple &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Robot')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Robot')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt;, able to interact with vast numbers 
              of other foglets to form nearly any shape imaginable, including 
              objects that are able to move and react to human beings. One might 
              be able to re-create the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Star Trek')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Star Trek')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt; "holodeck" using foglets&amp;#8212an 
              environment in which almost anything becomes possible. The flexibility 
              that makes this idea attractive also creates the risk that the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Utility')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Utility')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; 
              fog might be infected with an information &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Virus')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Virus')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; designed to take 
              it over for malicious purposes, harming or killing or simply trapping 
              a human in the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Utility Fog')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Utility Fog')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;utility fog&lt;/a&gt; environment. The fixed-function approach 
              of building things out of nanoblocks and recycling things when they 
              are no longer needed seems safer, at least for the early days of 
              molecular manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Fabber Safety and Security Issues&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The use of nanoblocks creates opportunities to make molecular manufacturing 
              safer.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With a careful selection of the types of nanoblocks made available, 
              a fabber should not be able to build an atom precise nanofactory 
              out of nanoblocks, nor devices that will be a significant help in 
              any attempt to "bootstrap" production of an atom precise 
              nanofactory, reducing the risk of proliferation of atom precise 
              MM to "rogue nations" or terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A nanoblock-only fabber (i.e. one which cannot produce its own 
              nanoblocks, and so requires a supply of nanoblocks as input) could 
              be distributed world-wide without releasing atom precise MM to everyone, 
              avoiding any risk that anyone could start using it to produce massive 
              quantities of dangerous products out of freely available atoms. 
              Yet it would allow construction of almost as wide a range of products 
              as an atom precise nanofactory, for not much more cost&amp;#8212reducing 
              demand for atom precise MM.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There would be products that could not be made out of nanoblocks, 
              of course&amp;#8212such as nanoblocks themselves. This fact could give 
              official security forces with &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Access')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Access')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;access&lt;/a&gt; to atom precise nanofactories 
              an advantage, as weapons and &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('System')" onMouseOver="playBrain('System')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;s made with atom precise nanofactories 
              will be somewhat more capable than any created using nanoblock fabbers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Products of &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Commercial')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Commercial')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; or security value that cannot be made out 
              of nanoblocks and require atom precise assembly could be made in 
              centralized plants where security measures could be taken. One simple 
              security measure would be to have such products made by dedicated 
              function nanofactories, with the design built in at the lowest level 
              and unable to be altered without destroying the nanofactory. These 
              dedicated function nanofactories would be produced using general-purpose 
              programmable nanofactories in a few extremely high security plants.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;The Risk of Exponential &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Self-Replication')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Self-Replication')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Self-Replication&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anyone familiar with the "grey goo" exponential self-replication 
              scenario might ask whether a device made of nanoblocks might disassemble 
              objects made of recyclable nanoblocks and re-use those nanoblocks 
              to produce copies of the device&amp;#8212a "lumpy goo" scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To prevent this, one solution would be to design nanoblocks to 
              require use of a key-like manipulator&amp;#8212too small to be made 
              of or emulated by nanoblocks&amp;#8212to lock blocks together in order 
              to fabricate objects. So long as the key-like manipulator is only 
              built into fabbers, and never made part of or attached to a commonly 
              available nanoblock, only fabbers will be able to build things from 
              those nanoblocks&amp;#8212eliminating much of the potential to build 
              a malicious self-replicator out of nanoblocks. The same key would 
              be required to disassemble objects for recycling&amp;#8212preventing 
              malicious disassembly of objects made of nanoblocks, outside of 
              dedicated recycling devices.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One could object that preventing the fabber from making copies 
              of itself would eliminate a potentially major advantage. A fabber 
              that can make copies of itself could be distributed very rapidly, 
              creating a huge market for nanoblocks and nanoblock-based designs 
              in a very short period of time. That should be a significant advantage 
              for a manufacturer willing to give up income from the fabber and 
              focus on selling nanoblocks. So long as the nanoblocks were non-reusable, 
              the risk of exponential self-replication would be minimized&amp;#8212and 
              the manufacturer could expect their fabber to become a universal 
              standard before competitors got to market, making their nanoblock 
              business quite profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;However, other companies would very quickly begin producing reverse-engineered 
              "clone" and improved nanoblocks, cutting into the original 
              manufacturer's revenues. It would likely not be long before someone 
              offered re-usable nanoblocks, opening the way to exponentially self-replicating 
              systems.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given the value of recyclable nanoblocks for energy and cost savings 
              and convenient disposal, and the security risks of self-copying 
              fabber &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Component')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Component')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;component&lt;/a&gt;s, it seems wisest to allow recyclable nanoblocks 
              but prohibit fabbers that can self-copy. Very likely the cost of 
              fabbers will fall rapidly in any case, since they would themselves 
              be made with atom precise MM.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The above assumes a relatively free market in fabber and nanoblock 
              designs. That may not be the case if the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Government')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Government')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; is involved 
              and sets a single standard that all manufacturers must follow. In 
              that case, one might see a "utility" model, where nanoblock 
              prices are controlled to allow manufacturers a "reasonable" 
              profit. This scenario would be likely to slow innovation&amp;#8212but, 
              of course, that might be exactly the effect desired by the government. 
              Non-self-copying fabbers with recyclable nanoblocks seem the most 
              likely choice in such a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Limiting Other Potential Abuses &lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fabbers will very likely be targeted with the equivalent of computer 
              viruses&amp;#8212malware designs that will attempt to infect fabbers 
              and transmit copies of themselves, and probably use the fabber to 
              produce something annoying or dangerous. The greatest danger would 
              be if fabbers were connected directly to the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Internet')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Internet')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, allowing 
              very rapid spread of such a virus without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One way to fight this would be to keep all fabbers "offline"&amp;#8212designed 
              to only allow loading new designs by manually transferring a design 
              on a physically separate storage medium. This should slow the spread 
              of malware down to human speeds, allowing humans a chance to become 
              aware of the problem and deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It may prove useful to establish a program that allows anyone with 
              an interest in "clever fabber hacks" or atom precise molecular 
              manufacturing to exercise their curiosity in a safe, controlled 
              environment. This would help reduce the incidence of '&lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Experiment')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Experiment')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;s' 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Analog')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Analog')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;analog&lt;/a&gt;ous to releasing computer viruses and worms into the wild, 
              by giving &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Hacker')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Hacker')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt;s an alternative and encouraging environment. Their 
              creative&amp;#8212or potentially destructive&amp;#8212ideas could benefit 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Society')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Society')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt; or help plan defenses against potential dangers. It also 
              provides an opportunity to catch the few who are going down the 
              wrong path and turn them around - or at least keep know who they 
              are if they seem inclined to persist in dangerous pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Malicious users could produce dangerous or otherwise undesirable 
              nanoblock-based products. For example, a murderer might create a 
              knife, kill someone, and disassemble the evidence. Or perhaps create 
              a household robot&amp;#8212but program it to wreak havoc. Defenses against 
              such abuses should be taken into consideration. There are several 
              approaches that might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since recyclable nanoblocks would have a readable type-ID built 
              in, it would be trivial to extend that to a unique ID, making it 
              possible to backtrack the source of an otherwise anonymous malicious 
              automated device, or obtain a clue from nanoblocks torn off a more 
              mundane object such as a knife. With users knowing this, fewer will 
              seriously contemplate engaging in malicious production.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Life')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Life')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; with Fabbers &lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The use of nanoblock-limited fabbers (i.e., those which cannot 
              make their own nanoblocks) has some likely implications for society. 
              Certainly costs of many material goods should fall, raising the 
              standard of living of many people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If instead, self-copying fabbers and non-recyclable nanoblocks 
              are available, benefits for less developed nations may arrive a 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Bit')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Bit')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; sooner, but the need to continually buy more nanoblocks will 
              limit their long-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some visions of life with atom precise MM have people going "off 
              the grid"&amp;#8212quitting their jobs, setting up independent 
              solar powered homesteads, and ending &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Capitalism')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Capitalism')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Economics')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Economics')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt; 
              as we know them. That scenario would be very unlikely with non-recyclable 
              nanoblocks, and limited with recyclable nanoblocks, as people would 
              still need to engage in productive economic activity in order to 
              have money to buy replacement nanoblocks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With most jobs in manufacturing and distribution eliminated, people 
              would largely find jobs in the service sector. Service jobs will 
              shift even more to specialization, due to increased competition. 
              Developed nations have already gone far in this direction, and other 
              nations will likely be forced to follow suit. This will be a difficult 
              transition for nations that have only recently begun developing 
              and have been heavily dependent upon manufacturing for &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Export')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Export')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;export&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212services 
              will be more difficult to export, and local consumers may not be 
              as used to consuming services.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another common vision of life after the arrival of atom precise 
              MM has a tension between free "open source" designs and 
              commercially available designs. The greater ease of designing with 
              nanoblocks instead of atoms would likely give the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Open Source')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Open Source')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; approach 
              extra impetus. Still, there will also be a fair number of things 
              that people will not trust to be made from nanoblocks, and conventional 
              commerce in those products will continue. Also, as always, there 
              will be elements of style and usage that will cause people to pay 
              for things even though free alternatives are available, just as 
              people today will pay more for a real Rolex&amp;#153; than a fake, or 
              pay for a commonly used &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Operating System (OS)')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Operating System (OS)')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; even though free operating 
              systems are available.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With so many choices, and so many people seeking employment in 
              services, it seems likely that many stores will focus on personal 
              service and product advice. Goods purchased in a shop will be priced 
              based on a combination of service and the prestige of certain designers, 
              with a very small component of the cost of the nanoblocks used in 
              product construction. There still will be "big chain" 
              stores with vast showrooms filled with goods, but even there, the 
              key will be the service of providing one place to go see and compare 
              a huge variety of goods. They may make some goods while you wait, 
              others they'll have available off the shelf, still others&amp;#8212especially 
              larger goods&amp;#8212they'll make and deliver to your home. Likely, 
              there also will be a way to buy "limited uses" designs 
              for home production.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Making nanoblock-limited fabbers available to everyone promises 
              to provide most of the easily imaginable benefits of unrestricted 
              atom precise MM, with significantly fewer risks. Fabbers can provide 
              useful advantages of speed, efficiency, and safety. Certainly, they 
              are not a cure-all, creating a perfect utopia&amp;#8212but the problems 
              remaining may be humanly manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perhaps fabbers would only be a transition phase before a shift 
              to a more liberal availability of atom precise MM, but given all 
              the risks and uncertainties raised by molecular manufacturing, this 
              more controlled introduction seems warranted. The most likely alternative 
              is not free release of atom precise MM, but even tighter restrictions. 
              Fabbers limited to constructing things out of nanoblocks seem like 
              a reasonable compromise approach, and one that government authorities 
              and others may consider acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like this model quite a bit, largely because it does not resort to easily-broken DRM schemes for its security. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I'd like to make a suggestion which would allow for safe recursive fabbing, though. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Have two "keys" for use by block manipulators: one key to assemble blocks, and another one to disassemble them. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If you then release nanoblocks with assembly keys, but restrict disassembly keys to dedicated recyclers (which are atom-precise products), you can allow people most of the power of recursive fab applications with a double-layer of protection against runaway replicators.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The first layer is already present in Craver's model as proposed; replicators can't build anything out of plain atoms - it will require nanoblocks. Since these will be relatively rare, runaway repliction will be limited. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If you additionally limit the accessbility of the disassembly keys, that further limits runaway replicators to //raw// nanoblocks, which can be stored in sealed hoppers to keep them relatively safe. Because a runaway replicator will need to disassemble already-assembled products before it can incorporate them into it's own design, and disassembly keys can't be part of its own design, this adds a second layer of protection that also further restricts fuel candidates for runaway replicators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="/images/blank.gif" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
