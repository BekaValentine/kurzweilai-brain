<div class="TeaserText">Experts in various areas were asked to speculate on life in the year 3000. Their ideas were compiled into six scenarios by two leading futurists for the Millennium Project of the American Council for the United Nations University. "The authors provide some insightful scenarios," says Ray Kurzweil. "However, I feel that their time frames do not adequately reflect the accelerating pace of progress inherent in what I call the law of accelerating returns.  The types of changes they describe for 2050 and 3000 respectively will arrive much earlier in my view, but the issues raised by such developments as femtotechnology and nonbiological intelligence are compellingly described."</div>

<h1><br>
              Brief background on the study </h1>
<p>The Millennium Project of the American Council for the United Nations 
              University in cooperation with The Foundation for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> conducted 
              a special study on collecting foreseeable factors that might significantly 
              affect the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of humanity in the next 1000 years. Those factors 
              were rated by the panel of the first round of this study as to: 
              a) how plausible it is that the factor will influence the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              condition 1000 years from today; b) assuming that the factor does 
              occur, how <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant its effect might be on the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> condition; 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">c</a>) ability of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intervention such as policy and/or funding 
              to affect that factor's trajectory. Round 1 also asked about the 
              factor's likely trajectory, benchmarks of its development, and some 
              possible unexpected or low probability consequences. </p>
<p>These views were used by the authors, Jerry Glenn and Theodore 
              J. Gordon, to construct six draft scenario sketches to the year 
              3000. The second and final questionnaire asked for participants' 
              additions, edits, corrections, and comments on these scenarios. 
              They were also asked to list a fundamentally <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant question 
              or two that arises due to the scenario. The results are included 
              in the State of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> at the Millennium. </p>
<h1> <a name="Scenario1"></a>Scenario 1. Still Alive at 3000 </h1>
<p>Even though we understand how to work with the forces of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, 
              unlike our environmentally destructive past, we do not yet know 
              how to provide <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> security for all. The integration of bio- and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> and our more enlightened

              and 50 billion in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Although few would prefer to go back to 
              the kinds of dangers we faced 40 generations or a thousand years 
              ago, we still have major challenges ahead. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">Civilization</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and the diverse lives within it render 
              the old <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Age measures of income, <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, physical 
              abilities, and social status meaningless in the year 3000. Although 
              our lives on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> and in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> are by no means perfect, we have 
              made it through cyber and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> wars, natural disasters, mass 
              migrations, and new <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s that threatened to wipe out humanity 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of times over the past thousand years. </p>
<p>By the twenty-second century the greenhouse effect had leveled 
              off. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> reduced the per capita drain on the environment. Architectural 
              design improved <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> efficiencies. Vaporization of seawater by 
              pressure techniques made abundant fresh water. Fossil fuels were 
              replaced by a combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> solar power and nuclear fusion 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> and in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Nearly 20% of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> also came from wind, 
              ground-solar, and geothermal sources. <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">Electromagnetic</a> beams or super 
              batteries transported most <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. These in turn have since been 
              replaced by today's <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s relying on the management of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of mass, made possible by scientific breakthroughs 
              impossible for most to comprehend a millennium ago. </p>
<p>Although it was never quite clear whether <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> proceeded 
              faster than our ability to control it, we were unable to prevent 
              the use of nanoweapons, genetic sabotage, and various forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a>. Ancient hatreds from unresolved conflicts 
              occasionally burst forth with enough allies in a variety of powerful 
              places to get advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s to cause serious damage. Fortunately, 
              foresight and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> assessments with <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>-wide feedback 
              created enough counter measures that we are still alive today. Global 
              codes of <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> with economic and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> enforcement powers scrutinized 
              by public cyber <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> probably deterred many dangers as well. However, 
              the possibilities for new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s from anomalies among 
              natural mutations, artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s leave 
              us all a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> uneasy even today. </p>
<p>On the brighter side, inherited <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s of our ancestors no longer 
              exist. They were eliminated by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> after several 
              generations of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious public debates in the early 
              third millennium. Parents who wanted the best for their children 
              in the early twenty-second century drove the next step of genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering toward enhanced <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and other features. </p>
<p>The genes that influenced a range of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functions were identified 
              during the early twenty-first century. Low <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, like poor 
              eyesight, was considered a genetic problem and was treated. Based 
              on this success, many parents crossed borders to take their children 
              to countries that legalized <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> enhancement, causing other 
              countries to allow the practice-with an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant addition. They 
              added the requirement that genes influencing compassion and related 
              behaviors be checked and coupled with the treatment. As a result, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ability to deal with complex and unexpected problems was greatly 
              increased, as was our foresight, reaction <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and compassion. 
            </p>
<p>The trade-offs between enhanced <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              are under continual review, since our abilities in both areas are 
              constantly evolving. The efficiency and <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> of improved <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s verses genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering to increase <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> and 
              collective <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> have also been debated for centuries. </p>
<p>Ecological and fundamentalist religious groups who resisted genetic 
              enhancement finally accepted the value of increased <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              health, and more ethical behavior made possible by relatively minor 
              genetic modification and <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly tailored foods. Unfortunately, 
              they gave in too soon. Unforeseen new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s and genetic 
              weaknesses were added to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> gene line and passed on to later 
              generations. Although cosmic rays have also been doing this throughout 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, direct <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intervention had broader and faster impacts, 
              which seemed more menacing. Even more worrisome was genetic sabotage. 
              Like <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses that polluted <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, the spread of genetic 
              errors polluted the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> gene pool. This contributed to unanticipated 
              speciation within our genus. Although international treaties on 
              global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> were ratified, constant vigilance was necessary to 
              prevent the use of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to create slave cultures and 
              bioweapons over the past thousand years. Fortunately, we can detect 
              problems in vitro and prevent their propagation. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              were increased or enhanced in parallel by constantly adding new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s to force the incorporation of <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> and global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> 
              in all <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. In the pre-global <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> era, few people had many 
              chances to use their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> for humanitarian purposes. Today 
              we are all so interconnected that the right use of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is constantly questioned, making the ancient dialectic of <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> very much alive today. Waste of any sort - including 
              of good ideas and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> talent - has become recognized as a sin. 
              If an idea was not <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed by the right person for the right <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> 
              at the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to make an improvement, it was considered to be 
              a waste, a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> pollution. </p>
<p>Increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, training, and nutrition 
              became significantly augmented by genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Both <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and collective <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> had increased and become so interconnected 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that it could no longer be measured as an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. Although <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> perspectives still 
              exist in the year 3000, as sort of an ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, the continual 
              intensity of complex interactivities with so many people and artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s has blurred the distinction between the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>'s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of that person's environment. With so 
              much to draw from among each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of interactions, each 
              person became more unique rather than similar. External protocols 
              were in common, but a person's subjectivity became far more unique 
              than our ancestors' of thousands of years ago. Each millennium, 
              humanity has become a richer <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of minds, while reinforcing 
              much of the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual commonality. </p>
<p>Most historians agree that global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> would have evolved eventually 
              as part of the processes of <a class="thought" href="entries/globalization_entry.html">globalization</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> migration, and 
              environmental security efforts, but the fact remains that the rich-poor 
              cyber biowars and then the series of earthquakes that destroyed 
              several megacities in the mid-twenty-second century accelerated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in global <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> by engendering unprecedented global compassion. 
              At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of trans-religious-philosophical dialogues 
              increased rapidly. These dialogues were careful not to create a 
              global theocracy, but to support the development of many new worldviews, 
              which improved the climate of decision making for better policy 
              for improved <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-environmental <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> and addressing <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>. 
            </p>
<p>All these developments created the conditions for protocols of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> and inter-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> standards, first enshrined in a variety 
              of international treaties that provided the political stability 
              that lead to the prosperity we enjoy today. Some governing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              were watershed-based. Others were market-oriented. Some are ad-hocracies 
              of mutual intentions. The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of governance <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s gave 
              rise to a political <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> that still honors the old nation-states, 
              international organizations, corporations, and NGOs for their <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              roles in the maintenance of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>, much as the autonomic 
              nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> does for an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>. But just as the frontal lobe 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> controls the anticipatory <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing that makes change, 
              the new political ecologies of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s organized around shared 
              intentions have become the creators of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> and are more interesting 
              than the ethnic and national identities of the past. Indo-Chinese 
              cultures still dominate much of contemporary style, however. <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">Individual</a>s 
              participate in thousands of these "intentions" per day, 
              creating new groups and leaving old ones all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The new political 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> combined the best of collective <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ivity with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> and subjectivity. </p>
<p>Perceptual barriers in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> helped keep some potentially 
              conflicting groups out of each other's way. This bought <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for 
              increased <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> interconnectivity to lessen differences in points 
              of view, while also allowing for the emergence of philosophical 
              tolerance among differing worldviews. </p>
<p>At the turn of the fourth millennium, the combination of genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> has achieved "functional <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>." 
              People die only by accident or choice (often with religious ceremonies). 
              The population of Earthkind has fluctuated between 9 and 11 billion 
              for the past several centuries, while Spacekind's birth rate has 
              exploded, resulting in 50 billion humans throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>. 
              Those who die transfer their <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> to new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms. 
              These <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms were produced first in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> habitats 
              by mating self-replicating intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> 
              created from unique gene sequences not found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. They were 
              created to help maintain much of our infrastructure and a healthy 
              relationship between artificial and natural environments both on 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> and in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. </p>
<p>New forms of social organization emerged as the result of being 
              supported by these <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms. Instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> hierarchies 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s for accumulation of religious, ethnic, economic, and 
              political power, <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s continually selected different combinations 
              of people and technological capacities to follow their curiosity. 
              The first were the series of Seatopias. These ocean habitats consumed 
              vast amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide to grow coral for marine biotecture 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>). They created symbiotic relationships 
              with the environment and helped restabilize terrestrial climate 
              after <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> threatened to hit the runaway or "Venus" 
              point of rapid temperature increase. World Wilderness Parks were 
              also established during this period and remain intact today. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> had become as ubiquitous by the mid-third millennium 
              as electricity had by the end of the second millennium. Today we 
              are utterly dependent on picotechnology, which manipulates the atomic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, and femtotechnology, which manipulates <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. 
              This <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> allowed us to create new materials able to use <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> sources, resulting in varieties of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> unimaginable to most 
              humans just a few hundred years ago. "Star Trek replicators" 
              also made possible by these technologies, which were imagined a 
              thousand years ago, have now become key to the <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> of prosperity 
              brought by <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> management. Although many pursue a materially 
              simple <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a> today in the ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. In 
              addition to global credit <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s with infobanks for <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ial 
              opportunities, <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> living units eliminated <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a> as known in 
              ancient times. The units contained <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies that can produce 
              food, shelter, clothing, and are able to self-replicate. </p>
<p>The early success of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, agriculture, industrial 
              maintenance, super materials, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips, and self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s caused the acceleration of their use beyond our ability 
              to control their dispersal. Nanotransceiver robots coupled with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms have killed the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>, but they 
              have also made criminal acts less likely today. An intellectual 
              arms race arose to create better countermeasures for signal jamming 
              and active <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> shields. </p>
<p>Even though <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> migration immunized humanity against a multitude 
              of potential physical and social <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> events, the acceleration 
              of the sustained <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> was driven more by curiosity than 
              by survival or economic necessity. Many wanted the challenge; others 
              simply wanted escape from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, saying that humans had become like 
              yeast in a closed bottle-proliferating and battling over limited 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>. The more conservative of these pioneers chose to build 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> settlements in capsules on Mars and then later terraformed 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. The more adventurous chose to live in free-roaming <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> 
              stations, while the most adventurous committed their gene line to 
              be augmented by <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> over several generations. These became

<p>Political <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> tried to maintain control over <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> 
              settlements, even after these pioneers had paid back the investments 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. Income from <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> tourism, electricity from <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> solar 
              power, orbital retirement communities, and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> industrialization 
              were enormous. Conflicts between Spacekind and Earthkind escalated 
              until political independence was granted to <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> settlements. Population 
              pressures had increased public discussions about mass migrations, 
              but not until the series of earthquakes in megacities and the onslaught 
              of new <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s did <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> migration begin to be taken seriously 
              by the general public. Fortunately, launch costs had fallen far 
              enough at this point that large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s could begin to migrate.

<p>The growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of nuclear nations and increasing opportunities 
              to hijack radioactive waste during transport led to the use of this 
              waste by terrorists. This triggered several "brush fire" 
              nuclear wars and the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> poisons, 
              which spread sufficiently in the early twenty-first century that

<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> was lost in much of Europe and Asia. Even in less affected 
              areas, <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> sufficiently moved the Gulf Stream to lower 
              temperatures to reduce European agriculture. The resulting mass 
              migrations to Africa and the Americas throughout the twenty-first 
              century caused further conflict. The daily struggle of 30 million 
              AIDS orphans without <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> or mercy turned so many in Africa to crime 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s that roving gangs eventually made political stability impossible.

              out of control and killed so many people that only minor sections

              America, transmission signals were interrupted by the social turmoil 
              often enough that things got out of hand and turned large areas 
              into a gray wasteland. As a result, the prevalence of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, pestilence, 
              and famine increased across Africa and America. </p>
<p>Efforts to create more serious international governance <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              failed. An <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> iron curtain arose between the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>less. The decay of family and social values, corruption, 
              and transnational crime became the governing <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. 
              No one cared about the environment. </p>
<p>Then in the twenty-second century, cataclysmic earthquakes under 
              several megacities drove millions into savage frenzies for the necessities 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Self-organizing groups in safer areas created artificial

              By the twenty-third century, these new <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms put some <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s

</h1>
<p>SETTING: A reconstructed but fairly accurate olive grove. The Acropolis 
              is painted in the background. Clearly this is ancient Greece. The 
              participants are a student audience and a lecturer, all in white 
              togas. </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Class, it's pleasant to meet with you in this archaic 
              way, sitting here face to face and really talking. I know it's a 
              throwback to the Greeks, 3,500 years or so ago, but you have to 
              admit that there's something refreshing about actually seeing each 
              other in person and-what shall we call it-presence. And since the 
              topic of this seminar is the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel, it seemed appropriate 
              that we actually see one another in the flesh, so to speak, just 
              like the old days. This desire to re-create (notice the similarity 
              to the old English word "recreation") is stronger than 
              ever these days; I hope you find the togas and olive trees a nice 
              touch. I invite you to ask questions and add observations of your 
              own as we proceed this morning.</p>
<p> To begin with, let's agree that moving people from one <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> period 
              to another constituted a leap for humankind into a previously unexplored 
              dimension of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. Certainly, before there was physical <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              shifting, there was the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>-the issues and events of 
              prior times. Historians attempted to give a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the past by 
              reconstructing <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> from natural records and from the notes and 
              documents of archivists, but the idea of traveling in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-actually 
              moving to a different era, forward or back from the infinitely small 
              island of the present-didn't gain attention until the early twentieth 
              century, when the great physicist Einstein postulated, in his special 
              theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, that nothing could move faster than the speed 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. </p>
<p>Oh, certainly there had been speculation about what <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> really 
              was since the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the Greeks. And the ancients looked at the 
              heavens and measured the stars and <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s and knew the seasons. 
              In the nineteenth century, H.G. Wells, a novelist, wrote about a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, all brass and black that transported a person back 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. When <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> bloomed in the twentieth 
              century, all manner of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s for projecting into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              or into the past were imagined. Finney described a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that involved 
              using intense <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> as the means for moving in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. But it was 
              in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries that scientists 
              knew something like <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel might really be feasible. Carl Sagan, 
              a popular exo-biologist of the late twentieth century, said: </p>
<p class="BlockQuotation">Such questions [Is <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel possible?] 
              are purely a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of evidence and if the evidence is inconsistent 
              or insufficient, then we withhold judgment until there is better 
              evidence. Right now, we are in one of those classic, wonderfully 
              evocative moments in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> when we don't know, when there are 
              those on both sides of the debate, and when what is at stake is 
              very mystifying and very profound. </p>
<p>QUESTION: But, Professor, that sounds quite evasive to me, not 
              an endorsement for the practicality of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel. </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Yes, I take your point. But at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for any scientist 
              to admit that there was the possibility of phenomena beyond the 
              dogma of their disciplines was incredibly forward-looking. It was 
              this attitude of "maybe" that gave permission to conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> to go beyond its constraining beliefs. </p>
<p>As I said, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was a frontier, a challenge, a new place for <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              and exploration. It began with this "maybe." By the mid-twenty-first 
              century, geographic frontiers were explored on Earth: from jungles 
              that at first were called impenetrable in the late nineteenth century 
              to the ocean floors complete with vents and metal nodules in the 
              twenty-first, to the geological mantle and sub-crust clear through 
              to the magma in the twenty-second. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, it seems, has an 
              innate urge to explore, so once geophysical <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> was probed and 
              described in all of its intricacies, other boundaries beckoned. 
            </p>
<p>QUESTION: How about the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: The <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s were next-or rather, in parallel-through 
              robotic examination and in the case of the Moon, Mars and Venus, 
              through manned bases that extended from the twenty-first century 
              through the present, with the cities on those <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s and the moon 
              being the result. </p>
<p>Frontiers were also pressed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual and experiential front: 
              pre-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/psychotropic_entry.html">psychotropic</a>s (800 years ago), <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> chimera 
              (700 years ago), and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-to-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> transfer of <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> interconnects 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>s (600 years ago). But by the twenty-fifth century we 
              were running short of frontiers. By that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we had gained <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> 
              (I'm using that term in its present meaning-that is, we had reached 
              the plateau of social organization of work that permitted anyone 
              total respite, the notion of work had disappeared and people had, 
              our topic exactly, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>). And the possible exploration of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> stood 
              there invitingly. </p>
<p>QUESTION: But what did people think <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: They measured flow by it: so many gallons per hour, 
              or births per year. And they considered it a flow too, the course 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. But measuring the flow of a flow was not a <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> that 
              many had. The standard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> keeper evolved from the sundial and 
              the hour glass to the atomic clock that eventually measured <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              with an accuracy of one second per millennium, but it all related 
              to one-way flow, an arrow of aging and <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, irreversible and 
              inevitable. What a barrier to overcome! </p>
<p>It didn't happen all at once, of course; there was a confluence 
              of ideas and capabilities that gave impetus to the field. Einstein 
              himself gave the first clue: No material <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> can travel as fast 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. (Or more precisely: the great principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> 
              is not that you can't travel faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-it is that the laws 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> are the same for all observers (and atoms, <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s, and 
              so on) regardless of any relative <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> they may have with respect 
              to each other.) Observers looking at fast-traveling <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s have 
              slower running <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> than the observers who are on those fast-traveling 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. This <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> gave rise to the lovely nursery tale of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-crossed lovers, Picard and Juliet: one a starship captain 
              who flew beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a> at speeds near what his lover saw as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> speed, only to return one year later by his reckoning, to 
              find his lover shockingly older. </p>
<p>Advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> gave then the next clues. Some quantum 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s that demonstrated the <a class="thought" href="entries/nonlocality_entry.html">nonlocality</a> of quantum effects 
              made a lot of people scratch their heads in the twenty-first century. 
              Picture this: at a test site in Europe. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Europe? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Yes, there was a Europe then. A <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> was sent down 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/fiber_optics_entry.html">fiber optics</a> filament. The filament branched into two paths. <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">Wave</a>-like, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> went down both branches simultaneously as two <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s 
              (if you want to express the process in <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> terms). The termini 
              of the two branches were kilometers apart. Yet when one of the properties 
              of one <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> (for example, spin, momentum, or polarization) was 
              resolved (say, the spin was measured) the property of the other 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> was instantly established. </p>
<p>QUESTION: They must have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that was weird. </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: That's exactly what they called it: weirdness. The term 
              is very much like magic - that is, they saw it happen and were willing 
              to accept the evidence of their own eyes, but like magic to the 
              aborigines, they didn't understand it. This quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> was 
              explainable in mathematical terms but was contrary to the <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. (For your <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, I have handed out a copy of 
              one of the early <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 1 pages - still available in the archives, 
              you know - that describes one of the very first large-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              of this sort that I know of. It's attached to these notes along 
              with some references.) </p>
<p>This kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> was repeated many times at quantum levels 
              and was scaled to the level of atoms in the process of developing 
              the very first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips that did not rely on photolithography: 
              the quantum chips in which the quantum states of the atoms that 
              made up their computing apparatus were used for <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and counting. 
              But it's a long way from atoms to macro-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. </p>
<p>In the course of the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> backing up this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              wormholes were shown to exist, not only in theory but also in actuality. 
              A wormhole, according to an early text, is "a handle in the 
              topology of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, connecting two widely separated locations in 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>." At the quantum level, this meant that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              could flow instantly, in wormholes in the "quantum foam" 
              from point to point on a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>. This was the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> principally 
              responsible for today's intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, as you know. It was 
              only a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, no pun intended, until the experts scaled 
              up the effect. </p>
<p>So we had these socio-technical forces coming together about a 
              thousand years ago: a willingness by physicists to consider new 
              dimensions, a hunger by <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> at large for new frontiers, and 
              the blossoming field of quantum uncertainty and <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> travel took many forms. At first there was pseudo <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel 
              (PTT) in the period when the longing for <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel was building 
              but the means were yet absent. Around the globe, enclaves were built 
              that reconstructed periods of the past, the further development 
              of the theme park theme, if you will. There was Safari Land in Kenya: 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of pre-colonial tribal Africa, New World Plymouth, where 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travelers could live in the period of the early European settling 
              of America. There was Knight Land, medieval Europe, complete with 
              armor, lances and tournaments. These places were actually separate 
              countries-a place, but a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as well; they had their own <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s 
              (usually a historian was the ruler; historian-kings replaced the 
              ideal of philosopher-kings.). To get in, a person had to make a 
              commitment to live in the appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-style for at least 10 
              years or more likely a lifetime, severing all contact with the contemporary 
              world. These places were so popular that they were declared neutral 
              zones in the wars that were fought around them. Kids studied <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              and simulated these environments as someone used to study travel 
              folders. </p>
<p>QUESTION: But if they had to live in the old ways, didn't <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> 
              increase? How about <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Well, strange as it may sound, that was part of the 
              attraction. Ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> was seen as bland; this place offered 
              adventure and risk was part of it. As you can imagine, there was 
              corruption and astronomical profits were made, but the genre flourished. 
            </p>
<p>We went from PTT to TT when we deliberately sent people into the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. This actually was an outgrowth of PTT, since it was <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ed 
              that if we had people who were from the past societies that were 
              being modeled, then the accuracy would increase since they could 
              tell us how it really was. They would be the historian-kings and 
              queens. The first possibility of bringing people from the past to 
              the present was cryogenics or hibernation-that is, body freezing 
              or suspension in a slow aging state. When resuscitated these people 
              would bring with them their memories of their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. These <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              were generally unsuccessful. Another approach was developed: send 
              some people into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, and let their spacecraft build to high speed. 
              They would age slowly compared with people on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, so that when 
              they returned they would be a year or so older but a hundred years 
              or five hundred years would have passed on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. They would return 
              with essentially perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of the earlier <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and kinghood 
              would await in the appropriate enclave. The first of these travelers, 
              launched in 2352, have already returned and are setting up shop 
              in NATO land. Based on the launches of the last 500 years and speeds 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> for their aging voyages, we can expect to see returnees over 
              the next 10 millennia. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Sounds like fun. How do we sign up? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Well, the Global <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Travel Authority (GTTA) has control 
              and there's a waiting list, of course, to become a timetronaut. 
              And you know there are risks as well. If you go off to represent 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, say 3,000 years in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, with a high-speed 
              flight of a couple of years, you can't be sure that there will be 
              a world to return to. But you pay your money and take your chances 
              for a moment of fame. </p>
<p>So we have the first two steps: the PTT enclaves, and the fast-forward 
              historian-kings and queens that bring their <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              to the present. The third step is the one now occupying us, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              travel to the past for the common person, call it democratized <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              travel (DTT). <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> becomes an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. Now we're 
              into the issues of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Like the grandfather <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Exactly. You recall how it goes: suppose you go back 
              into the past and kill your grandfather. How then do you exist at 
              all? It sounds absurd today but scientists actually debated such 
              issues a thousand years ago. In discussing this <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>, Sagan said: 
            </p>
<p class="BlockQuotation">The heart of the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> is the apparent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of you, the murderer of your own grandfather when the 
              very act of murdering your own grandfather eliminates the possibility 
              of you ever coming into <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. </p>
<p>Among the claimed solutions are that you can't murder your grandfather. 
              You shoot him, but at the critical moment he bends over to tie his 
              shoelace, or the gun jams, or somehow <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> contrives to prevent 
              the act that interrupts the causality scheme leading to your own 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>&#8230;. </p>
<p>There have been some toy <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in which at just the moment 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is actuated, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> conspires to blow it 
              up, which has led Hawking [a leading cosmologist of the time] and 
              others to conclude that <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> will contrive it so that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel 
              never in fact occurs. But no one actually knows that this is the 
              case, and it cannot be known until we have a full theory of quantum 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>.... </p>
<p>Debate or not, the field moved forward and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings into the past is now a real possibility in the minds 
              of some scientists. The <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> on which the prospect is founded 
              - wormholes in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> - had its birth in work published in the 
              last millennium. Ford and Roman, for example, wrote about negative 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> a thousand years ago. They said: </p>
<p class="BlockQuotation">[As we all know] a person who leaves <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> 
              in a spaceship, travels near <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> speed and returns will have aged 
              less than someone who remains on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. If the traveler manages 
              to outrun a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> ray, perhaps by taking a shortcut through a wormhole 
              or a warp bubble, he may return before he left. Morris, Thorne, 
              and Uri Yurtsever, then at Cal Tech, proposed a wormhole <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              in 1988, and their paper has stimulated much <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel 
              over the past decade. In 1992 Hawking proved that any construction 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in a finite region of <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> inherently 
              requires negative <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. </p>
<p>So as we see, the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> was at least in inquiring minds for 
              a very long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. They went on to define the conditions under which 
              negative <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> might appear in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and hypothesized the use of 
              such negative pulses in the design of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/warp_drive_entry.html">warp drive</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Ford and Roman concluded their piece by saying: </p>
<p class="BlockQuotation">It seems that wormhole <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers face daunting 
              problems. They must find a mechanism for confining large amounts 
              of negative <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to extremely thin volumes. So-called cosmic strings, 
              hypothesized in some cosmological theories, involve very large <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              densities in long, narrow lines. </p>
<p>It is just these daunting problems described by Ford and Roman 
              that have been the touchstone over all these years for the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> designers. Maybe within a few decades we'll see whether 
              the work pays off. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Doesn't that lead to another kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>? If we invent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a> in our era, then it will exist in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              as well. So if people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> have this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, why don't 
              we see <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travelers from their era now? Where are the <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s 
              among us? </p>
<p>PROFESSOR: Good question. Maybe they can travel in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> but have 
              simply chosen to not come back. Or maybe they've chosen to go to 
              some other more exciting <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in the past. Or maybe they can regress 
              only over a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> interval-after all, our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are 
              limited too. Consider this: perhaps too many people were escaping 
              to the past, so laws were out in place to limit the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> migration. 
              Or maybe they are really here and are prevented by some <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> of 
              conduct from identifying themselves to us, but bring us <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to make us <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> to their standards. Ask yourselves 
              this: where does a discontinuous <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> like Einstein's come from?

<h1> <a name="Scenario4"></a>Scenario 4. The Great Divides </h1>
<p>By the year 3000, humanity has evolved into a continuum of three 
              principal <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms. One remains on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, rejecting much advancing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; another, which merged with <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, is a conscious-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>; and the third, which emerged as a range of artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms initially designed by humans, consists of new and independent 
              forms beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> control. </p>
<p>Some nations let <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic enhancement occur; others did not. 
              There were 5,000 distinct cultures in the year 2000. By 2100 the 
              effects of <a class="thought" href="entries/globalization_entry.html">globalization</a> had reduced this <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> to only a few 
              hundred in three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, but stimulated countless <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s 
              of sub-cultures in cyber <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Both three-dimensional and cyber 
              cultures began to bifurcate into those that preferred increased 
              involvement with advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and those that did not. Many 
              became afraid, as <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> surpassed many <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capacities. 
              Some <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that a global <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> would become a criminal 
              dictator and eventually eliminate humans. Others feared that one 
              day the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the technologies would grow beyond their ability 
              to correct errors, or that they might lose critical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to 
              fix the technologies on which they had become totally dependent. 
            </p>
<p>Although atomic-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> replaced factories that 
              so polluted <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> in the late twentieth century, standard humans 
              feared this could lead to a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> beyond their control. A religious 
              backlash against advancing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> swept the world. International 
              agreements established zones for preserving the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> and 
              saving remaining traditional cultures. Other zones allowed more 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al relationships with advancing technologies. </p>
<p>"Standard humans" believed their <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> was <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-dependent, and they shunned the use of cyber-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> symbiotic 
              transceivers. They wanted to be the traditional or standard <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. 
              Many were <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>-centered, seeking <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual transformation through 
              more animistic beliefs. Others were monotheists. Both feared contact 
              with the cyber-augmented global <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. They believed that yoga and 
              prayer were necessary to control the negative forces in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> could not solve everything. </p>
<p>They believed the oneness of humanity was to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual achievement, 
              not a technological one. <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual attunement with the forces of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> and Divinity was the strategy of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> the rules, 
              not technological imperatives. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is a classroom in a divinely 
              conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Standard humans' <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s with dolphins, 
              whales, primates, and domestic <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s gave an interspecies dimension 
              to their culture and expanded their awareness of the richness of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>. Most were vegetarians, and altruism was the uniting value. 
              Many of their habitats on land and in the water were built as archologies 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> based on ecological principles) that drew on some 
              forms of carefully selected nano- and <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, which helped 
              reduce environmental impact. </p>
<p>Many standard humans believe they have found the keys to enlightenment 
              and that some of their members have transformed themselves into 
              pure <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, giving them the ability to cruise dimensions. They 
              agree that conscious-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> beings are able to do almost anything, 
              but will never find the purpose of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. </p>
<p>Those who welcomed increased involvement with advancing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              argued that humans were <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary beings or a transitional <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, 
              and, as such, it was wrong to stay in one socio-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> niche. 
              They did not believe that their <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> was solely biobrain-dependent. 
              They sought enhancement both <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly and collectively through 
              a full range of technologies. Conscious-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> beings, or con-techs, 
              accepted the mystical attitude toward <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is 
              a miraculously interconnected whole, while at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> embracing 
              the technocratic management of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. </p>
<p>Their <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> responsibility was not based on metaphysical 
              beliefs in receiving a transcendental reward, but instead pragmatically 
              on making the world a better place in which to enjoy. Their ability 
              to tune simultaneously into the song of a bird nearby, a simulated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of the trial of <a class="thought" href="entries/socrates_entry.html">Socrates</a>, and a loved one many miles 
              away was common to all. The ability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> to "go anywhere, 
              anytime, and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> anything" <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>alized the ancient 
              religious idea of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> unity. </p>
<p>They improved their <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functioning by <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly tailored 
              nutrition and genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> and problem solving 
              were accelerated by <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> with global <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and other forms of cyber-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> symbiotics to stimulate neural 
              activity. These enhancements fed their minds, leading to rapid acceleration 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>-global feedback loops that 
              also furthered their social <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Some still remain on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, 
              but the bulk of conscious-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has moved beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. </p>
<p>The synergies among advances in neurophysiology, femtotechnology, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s opened the door to what has been called psychic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. The interplay of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> energies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              and our use of femtotech has allowed us to convert mental <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              for other purposes. Ideas helped power con-techs' world and increased 
              their metabolic rates to keep their weight down. </p>
<p>The first <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>-adapted con-techs were referred to as "space 
              fish" in remembrance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/joke_entry.html">joke</a> about fish swimming in the 
              oceans hundreds of millions of years ago who were convinced that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> would never evolve on land since there was no way to breathe. 
              The pioneering edge of conscious-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> left for several stars 
              identified as having the greatest potential for intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. 
              They believe that merger with other <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> throughout the cosmos will 
              be necessary to permeate the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to end the big-bang-contraction 
              cycle that leaves some in existential despair. </p>
<p>Con-techs tolerated the standard humans because their mystical 
              side honors the standard's quest for enlightenment, but relations 
              did have some conflict. Not all standards practiced their values, 
              just as con-techs didn't always balance their mystic-selves with 
              their technocratic-selves. The uneasy division between the two lasted 
              several hundred years until the con-techs gave birth to artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms without cytoplasm or <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly based neural <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. 
              One of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms was designed to seek and destroy the leftover 
              bionanotech agents used by terrorists. This success stimulated the 
              acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> to develop more <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms. 
            </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms today is beyond the ability 
              of any <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> (either standard and con-tech) to comprehend. Some 
              nanoforms are believed to have arrived in several <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and 
              mated with local <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s. Others have formed symbiotic relationships 
              with some <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>-centered humans, unbeknownst to them, and are reinforcing 
              the standard humans' animist beliefs by occasionally allowing them 
              to see inanimate <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s they inhabit seem to be alive. It is also 
              believed that these <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms help keep the peace between 
              the standard and conscious-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> humans today. </p>

<h1><a name="Scenario5"></a>Scenario 5. The Rise and Fall of the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">Robot</a> 
              Empire </h1>
<p>Within the last thousand years, robots rose from curiosities-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              that were barely helpful to the industrial economy of the early 
              twenty-first century-to positions of power five hundred years ago, 
              through the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-war to their current subservient role today: 
              an empire, if you will, gained and lost in 10 centuries, longer 
              than empires of either the Romans or the British. This waltz began 
              a thousand years ago with the confluence of a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of technologies 
              and social developments. On the one hand, the seminal technologies 
              pushing the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">Robot</a> Era were: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> - <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> - small <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s at first using 
                improved photolithography as the manufacturing tool, moving soon 
                to <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, using molecular processes for assembly of 
                parts with sub-micron dimensions. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> by 2100 became 
                as ubiquitous as electricity was in 1950. Then it became unexceptional

<p>This confluence led, early on, to molecular-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, atomic-scale

              creation of gold (or indeed any material) from base metals (or in 
              our case, atomic building blocks). </p>
<p>The "pull" for the early robots a thousand years ago 
              came from the need for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to perform dull, dangerous, and 
              repetitive jobs. People loved those early <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the twenty-first 
              century. They were crude at first, nonmobile but <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable and 
              adaptable and used primarily in mechanical and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> production 
              lines. Once <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> came on the scene, even in their 
              crudest forms, the robots gained mobility, became soldiers (mine 
              sweepers), policemen (bomb disposal), and pets. They cleaned sewers 
              and septic tanks, mined asteroids, and explored <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. They repaired 
              automobiles, they made deliveries, and they tilled the fields. As 
              mechanical moles, they found resources deep in the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. As ultra-small 
              monitors, they aided both police and criminals. As physician's assistants 
              they aided surgeons, the smallest of them entered <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bodies for 
              diagnosis (with <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> telemetered) and pumped blood when hearts failed. 
              (This bio-medical arm of the robotic tree was the beginning of our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> culture.) </p>
<p>The great catalog of Renssellaer Polytech published in 2200 attempted 
              to catalog the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> population and applications; 575,567 genera 
              could be separately identified as embodied in 100,675,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s had been self-repairing, and <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, self-replicating 
              for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but now they were evolving. Evolving toward what, 
              it was asked; the answer was, toward doing their jobs better, which 
              is more than <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>-even <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-directed <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>-could 
              produce. They could understand <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>, and it could be 
              said that many of the more advanced units had not only <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              brains but also minds, in that they were adaptive to changing circumstances 
              and could <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> best solutions even to situations unexpected by 
              their designers. <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">Emotion</a>s - particularly those believed to be epigenetic 
              - were added. Some neuro-physicists <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> robots' <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing purer 
              and superior to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing, at least in limited circumstances. 
              Throughout this early period, a primitive <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of Laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a> 
              was generally followed, first by general consensus and later as 
              required by legislation. </p>
<p>The great leap forward, as historians erroneously now call it, 
              came in 2235, when most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s then extant were interconnected 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s using common <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that were 
              self-adapted by each <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Because most of these <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s were 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/broadband_entry.html">broadband</a>, the robots' mobility was not impaired. This 
              technological stroke gave the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s global <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. They 
              were the embodiment of the global <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. What one knew, all knew. 
              This development was favored by most of the users of robots since 
              it gave them an instant and inexpensive boost in <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              and their <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s could draw on <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> collected by other 
              robots operating far away. </p>
<p>Robots were <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like and became philosophers, jugglers, politicians, 
              orators, actors, teachers, acrobats, artists, poets, and shepherds 
              of the less adept humans. Museums captured the folly and the glory 
              of the prior 50,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> was rational; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>, particularly combative <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>, was subdued. The robots 
              were exploring <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, well beyond the reaches of the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>, 
              on 10,000-year journeys to other stars, in environments of radiation, 
              heat, and acceleration that would have been unacceptable for humans. 
            </p>
<p>In an echo of the original <a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a>, humans asked what remained 
              for them. The answer was <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> leisure (although robots could improve 
              leisure enjoyment), <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> (although robots taught, learned faster, 
              and did not forget), and the joy of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> (although the robots seemed 
              to be enjoying themselves, too). <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> had a new caste <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, 
              and humans were a race tolerated and somewhat pitied by the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              that could outthink them and outperform them in any measure of strength, 
              vitality, speed and endurance. The most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant argument made 
              in the application of gene <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to improve <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mental and 
              physical performance was "we have to keep up with the robots." 
            </p>
<p>Keeping up was easier than it might have been: biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              provided the craftsmanship. The absolutely huge fields of genetic 
              choice and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/linguistics_entry.html">linguistics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s modeling, 
              organization of "consciousness," post-synaptic cascades, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> (which necessarily has a quasi-neural <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>), 
              and so on-remained the hottest and most rewarding (and reviled, 
              by some) <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> endeavor. </p>
<p>About this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, new "parasitic" processes appeared in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses, religious cults, fads, 
              crazes. and urban legends or addiction to <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> or new 
              drugs) that reproduced and spread very quickly thanks to efficient 
              transport and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. These were diverting but added 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for meaning. </p>
<p>But there were no environments that were off limits to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              as there were to humans. Was the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> becoming less livable? Perhaps 
              so, but only for humans. With resources becoming scarcer, natural 
              and artificial selection began to operate in earnest, distributing 
              available resources most efficiently to those entities that were 
              best able to exploit them-for the most part, the robots. </p>
<p>It was inevitable that humanity would try to pull the plug. The 
              term "slavery" was in the air-that is, slaves to the robots 
              and their insistent perfection. Suffice it to say that the mid-millennium 
              has been called the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the second crusade. Beginning in about 
              2500, serious questions were asked about the state of humans and 
              their inferior role. Was this what <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> intended? Were the robots 
              really the next step in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>? </p>
<p>The cyber commandos under the hereditary general-priests began 
              intensive study of the relationships among the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, to identify 
              their weaknesses, both mechanical and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al, and began to devise 
              a strategy, executed over three generations, that would result in 
              the elimination of robots' self-replicative <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. The question 
              at the center of their work: would the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s-smarter than the 
              cyber commandos in many respects-fall for their strategies? The 
              answer was to use <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ingenuity, randomness, secrecy, dedication, 
              and distraction. It took awhile but it worked. This at least began 
              to stabilize the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> population. From there it was tricky, but 
              the political <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> changed subtly and the vector of leadership 
              swung to humans and the old ways. Some argued that this was regression 
              of the worst sort-that the good old days were a chimera. But others 
              argued that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> destiny should remain with <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. </p>
<p>Today, the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant legacy of the rise and fall of robots 
              is our <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>: the artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              humans with manufactured <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. This <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> descends directly 
              from the confluence and synergies of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              bionics, materials <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>-and, 
              of course, <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>-and has led to the superior augmented <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              beings that now represent the finest people on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. </p>
<p>Certainly there are a few pure robots around, but the times have 
              indeed changed. It is hard to find pure humans anywhere. The distribution 
              of "human" <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> has broadened 
              almost exponentially. Through <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a>azation and genetic manipulation, 
              the natural physical <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> form and the natural <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are 
              hard to define today. Given the full, rational, conscious control 
              of the physical form and function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, down to the 
              molecular level, twentieth-century humans are essentially obsolete. 
              Although the robots are under <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> control once again, what it 
              means to be "human" has changed. Our ancestors would not 
              recognize these humans, except possibly for the "Hu-Manish" 
              (techno-retros, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to the Amish of the nineteenth century) 
              who elected to opt out of the techno-<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. Only 
              religious fanatics are unaltered humans. </p>
<p>As <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a>s, people can become anything they like, live for all 
              intents as long as they like, behave any way they would like. Our 
              capacities have given <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s power that twentieth-century humans 
              would undoubtedly have regarded as "god-like." Any person 
              can perform virtually any "magic trick" that has ever 
              been described in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, in fantasy stories, or in the 
              Bible. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> nano-enhanced person may personally command 
              energies of ~1012 watts, which is roughly sufficient to levitate 
              the Great Pyramid. What more would they have required of a God?

<h1><a name="Scenario6"></a>Scenario 6: ETI Disappoints after 9 Centuries 
            </h1>
<p>Back in the late years of the second millennium, scientists started 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for signs of extra-terrestrial <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> using whatever 
              tools they had available. "Certainly," they said, "with 
              so many <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s out there, there must be <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, probably intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, on some of them." Drake derived probability estimates 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of another <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> somewhere in the heavens, 
              advanced enough to be able to, and inquisitive enough to want to, 
              communicate and identify others who might be accompanying them in 
              their journey through <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s were established, 
              first under <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> authority and later under private funding, 
              to scan the heavens at what was then <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to be the most likely 
              radio frequency, the frequency of atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>. Using the biggest 
              radio telescopes, including the dish at Arecibo, meticulous scans 
              were made and analyzed, all to no avail. Nevertheless, the notion 
              of "others" was firmly imbedded in social myths of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. It appears in the popular literature of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in both written 
              and video form: <a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a>, UFOs, and many of the other surviving 
              ethnographic fables attest to this. </p>
<p>From the beginning it was realized that the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of contact could 
              not be foreseen. People believed, though, that the scientific advances 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> made it more likely to contact <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> elsewhere in the 
              cosmos; nevertheless, this did not imply that intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> would 
              exist near to them, or that it would be willing or capable of communicating 
              with them. In any case, there remained the strong physical limitation 
              of the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> on the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> over interstellar 
              distances. There were several apparent contacts in those early days, 
              blips on the receivers that seemed somehow coherent and different 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>, but none could be verified. They were named "Big 
              Bertha," for example, and "Hiss-Tweak." Hundreds 
              of man-years were spent on trying to decode them, but in the end 
              they were seen as just anomalies. </p>
<p>Those who continued the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> were looking for an encyclopedic 
              message (by radio or pulsed <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a>) from many <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-years away, or 
              contact with a super-smart probe that reached our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. They <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              - indeed, they hoped - that after contact, humanity and the other 
              "culture" could interact and evolve together. Humanity 
              might find ways to receive, decode, and learn from intelligent emanations 
              that originated on other worlds. </p>
<p>What right-minded person could claim with authority that in all 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> could only have happened here? 
              Yet discovery after a century was still only a hope. Leading scientists 
              and authors passed on that hope. Religious people wondered if <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> 
              beings believed in or knew <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. </p>
<p>There were people who argued that the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> should be stopped, 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> contact could prove to be malevolent, with 
              humans suffering much like Native Americans did when Europeans arrived 
              with Columbus, and like successive waves of Palo American immigrants 
              did to their predecessors. When <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s at different levels 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> meet, they said, that with the inferior <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              inevitably suffers. </p>
<p>Others said that the intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a>s might already 
              be aware of our <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> but not consider us intelligent enough 
              to be worth communicating with. As our own <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> increased, 
              the chances for contact also grew. So <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> was wary, in general, 
              but tolerant. The <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> continued. </p>
<p>As the mid-millennium approached there were three great developments 
              that gave new fuel to the activity. <br>
<ul>
<li><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> exploration and, to a limited degree, colonization. 
              </li>
<li>New modes of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, including noncoherent sources, 
                and techniques employing quantum phenomena to attain what seemed 
                to be faster-than-<a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> transfer of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. </li>
<li>Great advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a>, which provided new approaches 
                to the means for embedding intelligent messages in what otherwise 
                would seem to be <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>While large-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> migration did not take place, small-scale 
              off-<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> communities were created, including at first a scientific 
              lunar colony capable of autonomous, independent <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>. This 
              base was valuable for <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">astronomy</a>, scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, and manufacturing 
              under non-<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> conditions. Large-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> migration seemed to 
              be a less <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant development, given the enormous costs and the 
              relatively small benefits that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on Mars or the Moon would 
              offer. The counter-argument that if we stay on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, we have put 
              all of our eggs in the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s basket did not prevail. It was believed 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>ier and technologically more developed societies that 
              some permanent stations off <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> could be useful, but that it was 
              unlikely that these would have a large impact, unless <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s were 
              developed to make, for example, Mars more amenable to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> (terrafication) 
              or more <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-friendly <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s were discovered on neighboring stars 
              (say, in a radius of 20 <a class="thought" href="entries/light_year_entry.html">light year</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>). There had been 
              some early <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in terraforming with the use of newly designed 
              microorganisms and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> robots, but environmentalists argued 
              to keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary environment pristine. </p>
<p>Further, it was argued that since the policy of sustainable development 
              had worked, there was no need for extensive migration off our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. 
              Big natural or social catastrophes could change the situation suddenly, 
              of course. But even then it is an ethical question: Are we willing 
              to invest so that some minorities can escape, and for what <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s? 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is always harder in <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> colonies, especially if 
              they are spaceship-bound. People will be best off on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> 
              for much longer than a thousand years unless it is totally unsupportive 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, which is very unlikely in any situation. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> continued on the moon. The colony <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up there on the back 
              face scanned not only with the primitive techniques but also using 
              the new modes and codes. The ability to handle large amounts of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> had of course increased by several million million times, 
              but still no message from <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. </p>
<p>Hope was rekindled - enough to generate a few more centuries of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing, anyway - when primitive forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> were discovered 
              on other solar <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. The discovery of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms there created 
              a complex <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of opportunities (scientific discovery, agriculture) 
              and dangers (infections with <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> parasites). Yet intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> seemed more like an accident of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> than ever. </p>
<p>Just a few centuries ago, the belief that humankind might be alone 
              began to surface in earnest. A millennium, a third of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> since 
              Christ, as much <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as the interval between the Middle Ages and 
              the Industrial Age, and still no results. With so much <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> having 
              past, could this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably be called impatience? </p>
<p>The feeling of possibly being alone gave new impetus to <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> 
              and the need to guard humanity. <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> colonization would immunize 
              humanity against a multitude of physical and social <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> events. 
              As Joe Straczynski - creator of Babylon 5, a video-myth of the late 
              twentieth century - put it: "Scientists disagree on many things, 
              everyone has their own theories, but one thing that all physical 
              scientists agree on is that eventually the Sun will burn out. It 
              may take 10 billion years, but eventually it will happen and the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> will become uninhabitable. If, by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we have not learned 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> travel then Man will die. And <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/lao_tzu_entry.html">Lao Tzu</a>, Beethoven, 
              Mozart, Emily Dickinson and all that we have been will be lost. 
              It will be as if it had never been. So knowing that the <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> is inevitable and that <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> travel is very, very difficult, 
              it is never too early to start." And they believed it, and 
              so began the Noah project that so occupies us currently. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>If my predictions are correct, by the year 4000 we will no longer need to go to the dentist. Teeth will have become absolete, believe it or not. And long before then, around 3000, the time will have come when dentist's no longer need to visit colleague dentist's to have their teeth mended, because through an advanced robotic apparatus they will be able to tend to their own teeth. And long, long before 3000 the high suicide rate among dentists will have dropped spectacularly through the invention of virtual suicide. :-)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Thought the stuff on cryonics was needlessly timid at best and a bit dumb at worst. As for femtotech, if we accept RK's tenet as described in TAOSM and elsewhere, we should have it by the early 22nd century, followed by attotech, zeptotech, yoctotech, etc. There may not be a name for the dimensional yardstick of technology by the year 3000, but it seems premature to me to be putting a case for saying in effect, Thus Far And No Further. Should things pan out as RK suggests, we'll be getting a taste of time travel experiments a good deal sooner than the year 3000. How that will interplay with cultural migration and economics will be interesting, indeed! :-)</p></td>
