<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>A group from a major <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> company once came to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab 
              to learn about our current <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. The day started with their 
              explaining that they wanted to see <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Agents are 
              a fashionable kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> designed to learn users' 
              preferences and help anticipate and act on their needs. Throughout 
              the day the visitors saw many relevant things, including <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              to assist with collaboration among groups of people, environments 
              for describing how <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s can adapt, and mathematical techniques 
              for finding <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s in user <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. I almost fell out of my chair 
              at the wrap-up at the end of the day when they asked when they were 
              going to see <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. They had clearly been tasked to acquire 
              some agents, but wouldn't recognize one if it <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> them.</p>
<p>I spent a day consulting with a firm that spends billions of dollars 
              a year on <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>. After working with them for most 
              of the day on <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s for analyzing and visualizing large <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> sets 
              to find hidden <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, a senior executive asked if we could change 
              subjects and talk about "<a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">data mining</a>." He had heard about this great 
              new technique that separates the nuggets of insight from the chaff 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that most companies have. Unfortunately, he had no idea 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">data mining</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> analysis had anything to do with each 
              other, and that in fact that was what we had been doing all day 
              long.</p>
<p>At an industry lunch I found myself seated next to an editor for 
              a major <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> magazine. She was writing an article about exciting 
              recent breakthroughs in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, and asked me if 
              I used "neural net <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>." When I told her that I did use nonlinear 
              layered models to approximate functions with many variables, she 
              looked concerned but gave me a second chance and asked if I used 
              "<a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>." After I answered that I did include probabilities 
              in my models to let me account for advance beliefs and subsequent 
              observations, she rolled her eyes and made clear what a burden it 
              was to talk to someone who was so technologically unhip. She was 
              particularly disappointed to see such old-fashioned <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab.</p>
<p>Any <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> catalog is full of examples of perfectly unremarkable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s with remarkable descriptions. You can get ordinary games, 
              or games that take advantage of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; regular 
              image compression <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, or special ones that use <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; 
              plain <a class="thought" href="entries/word_processor_entry.html">word processor</a>s, or new and improved ones with artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The mysterious thing is that, other than 
              the descriptions, the capabilities of these new <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s are surprisingly 
              similar to those of the old-fashioned ones.</p>
<p>These unfortunate examples share a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly enhanced semiotic 
              confusion. I'm always suspicious when the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>" is injudiciously 
              attached to perfectly good <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s that don't need it. Adding "<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>" 
              confers the authority of, say, a great Victorian steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> on 
              what might otherwise be a perfectly unremarkable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.</p>
<p>If you're offered a better mousetrap, you can inspect it and evaluate 
              its design improvements. But if you're offered a better <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, it is difficult to peer inside and judge how it works. 
              Consequently, the words that are used to describe <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> can have 
              more influence and less meaning than those used to describe a mousetrap. 
              Because so many people are so unclear about where <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> leaves 
              off and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> begins, <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able people accept unreasonable claims 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. A market persists for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that purports 
              to speed up the processor in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, or add <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, 
              even though those <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s are clearly questions of physical resources. 
              It doesn't require an advanced testing laboratory to recognize that 
              such things can't (and don't) work.</p>
<p>These problems are not just a consequence of malicious marketing&amp;#8212even 
              the developers can be misled by their own labels. When I was a graduate 
              student at Cornell doing <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in the basement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> 
              building, there was a clear sign when someone's thesis <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              was in trouble: they made overly nice cases for their <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. 
              Creating and understanding new capabilities was difficult; creating 
              fancy packages for old capabilities was labor-intensive but guaranteed 
              to succeed. Making an elaborate housing provided the illusion of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> without the risk of failure because nothing new was actually 
              being done. Something similar is happening with bad <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s wrapped 
              in elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s and descriptions.</p>
<p>There are a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of words that I've found to be good indicators 
              of such suspect efforts because they are used so routinely in ways 
              that are innocently or intentionally misleading. Lurking behind 
              terms such as "multimedia," "<a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>," "<a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">chaos theory</a>," "agents," 
              "<a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s," and "<a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a>" are powerful ideas with fascinating 
              histories and remarkable implications, but their typical use is 
              something less than remarkable. Realization of their promise requires 
              much more than the casual application of a label.</p>
<p>When Yo-Yo was playing our cello you could correctly call what 
              he was doing "interactive multimedia" because a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> was making 
              sounds in response to his inputs, and you might even call it a kind 
              of "<a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>" because he was using physical sensors to manipulate 
              a virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>. But you probably wouldn't do either because 
              there was a much more compelling <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>: Yo-Yo Ma playing the cello. 
              This is another clue that one should worry about the use of these 
              kinds of technological buzz phrases. A marketing description of 
              the feature list of a Stradivarius could not distinguish it from 
              a lesser <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, or even from a multimedia <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> running a cello 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>. In fact, the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> would come out much better in a list 
              of standard features and available options and upgrades. The Strad, 
              after all, can only make <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. The words we usually use to describe 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have a hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> capturing the profound difference between 
              things that work, and things that work very well. A Strad differs 
              from a training violin in lots of apparently inconsequential details 
              that when taken together make all of the difference in the world.</p>
<p>People are often surprised to find that there's no one in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> 
              Lab who would say that they're working on multimedia. When the lab 
              started fifteen years ago, suggesting that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s should be able 
              to speak and listen and see was a radical thing to do, so much so 
              that it was almost grounds for being thrown off campus for not being 
              serious. Now not only are there conferences and journals on multimedia, 
              the best work being done has graduated from academic labs and can 
              be found at your local <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> store. It was a battle for the last 
              decade to argue that a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representation lets <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s be 
              equally adept at handling text, audio, or video. That's been won; 
              what <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s now is what is done with these capabilities.</p>
<p>Studying multimedia in a place like the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab makes as much 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> as studying typewriters in a writers' colony, or electricity 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer Science</a> department. Identifying with the tools deflects 
              attention away from the applications that should motivate and justify 
              them, and from the underlying skills that are needed to create them. 
              The causal ease of invoking "multimedia" to justify any effort that 
              involves sounds or images and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s is one of the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that 
              there has been so much bad done in the name of multimedia.</p>
<p>When I fly I've found a new <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to look for airsickness bags: 
              the in-flight videos touting new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. These hyperactive <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s 
              manage to simulate turbulence without even needing to leave the 
              ground. They are the video descendents of early desktop publishing. 
              When it became possible to put ten fonts on a page, people did, 
              making so much visual <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. Good designers spend years <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              about how to convey visual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in ways that guide and satisfy 
              the eye, that make it easy to find desired <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              from a big picture to details. It requires no skill to fill a page 
              with typography; it requires great discipline to put just enough 
              of the right kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the right place to communicate 
              the desired message rather than a <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> demo. In the same way, 
              adding audio and video together is easy when you have the right 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, but to be done well requires the <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> of 
              a film director, editor, cinematographer, and composer combined. 
              Jump cuts look just as bad done with bits or atoms.</p>
<p>Overuse of the possibilities afforded by improving <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has 
              come full circle in a style of visual design that miraculously manages 
              to capture in print the essence of bad multimedia. It hides the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> behind a layout of such <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>-boggling <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that, after 
              I admire the designer's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the features of their graphics 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, I put the magazine down and pick up a nice book. Such 
              cluttered design is certainly not conducive to distinguishing between 
              what exists and what does not, between what is possible and what 
              is not. And so here again in this kind of writing the labels attached 
              to things take on more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance than they should.</p>
<p>After <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> became multi, <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> became virtual. Displays were 
              put into goggles and sensor gloves were strapped onto hands, allowing 
              the wearer to move through <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-generated worlds. The problem 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> is that it is usually taken to mean a place 
              entirely disconnected from our world. Either you are in a physical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, or a virtual one. When most people first actually encounter 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they're disappointed because it's not that unlike 
              familiar <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a>s. Although in part this is a consequence of 
              describing simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s with fancy terms, the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> with video 
              games goes deeper. In a virtual world there is an environment that 
              responds to your <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s, and the same is true of a <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> is no more or less than <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with good sensors 
              and displays running models that can react in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. That kind 
              of capability is becoming so routine that it doesn't require a special 
              name.</p>
<p>One of the defining features of early <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> was that 
              it was completely immersive; the goal was to make video and audio 
              displays that completely plugged your senses. That's become less 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant, because bad <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> has reminded people of all 
              of the good features of the world of atoms. Instead of a sharp distinction 
              between the virtual and the physical world, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers are beginning 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> the best <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s of both by embedding the displays into 
              glasses or walls. Discussions about <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> lead to awkward 
              constructions like "real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>" to describe that which is not 
              virtual; it's much more natural to simply think about <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> as 
              something that is presented to you by <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in your environment, 
              both logical and physical.</p>
<p>"<a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">Chaos theory</a>" is a leading contender for a new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to describe 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of that physical environment and bring it into the 
              precise world of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. I read a recent newspaper article that 
              described the significance of ". . . <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">chaos theory</a>, which studies 
              the disorder of formless <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>." Wow. One can't 
              ask for much more than that. What makes "<a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">chaos theory</a>" particularly 
              stand out is that it is generally considered to be a theory only 
              by those who don't work on it.</p>
<p>The modern study of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> arguably grew out of Ed Lorenz's striking 
              discovery at MIT in the 1960s of equations that have solutions that 
              appear to be random. He was using the newly available <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              with graphical displays to study the weather. The equations that 
              govern it are much too complex to be solved exactly, so he had the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> find an approximate solution to a simplified model of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the atmosphere. When he plotted the results he <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              that he had made a mistake, because the graphs looked like random 
              scribbling. He didn't believe that his equations could be responsible 
              for such disorder. But, hard as he tried, he couldn't make the results 
              go away. He eventually concluded that the solution was correct; 
              the problem was with his expectations. He had found that apparently 
              innocuous equations can contain solutions of unimaginable <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. 
              This raised the striking possibility that weather forecasts are 
              so bad because it's fundamentally not possible to predict the weather, 
              rather than because the forecasters are not clever enough.</p>
<p>Like all good scientific discoveries, the seeds of Lorenz's observation 
              can be found much earlier. Around 1600 Johannes Kepler (a devout 
              Lutheran) was trying to explain the observations of the orbits of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. His first attempt, inspired by Copernicus, matched 
              them to the diameters of nested regular polyhedra (a pyramid inside 
              a cube . . . ). He published this analysis in the <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, 
              an elegant and entirely incorrect little book. While he got the 
              explanation wrong, this book did have all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of modern 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> practice, including a serious comparison between theoretical 
              predictions and <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al observations, and a discussion of the 
              measurement errors. Armed with this <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> plus better <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> 
              he got it right a few years later, publishing a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of three laws 
              that could correctly predict the orbits of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. The great 
              triumph of Newton's theory of gravitation around 1680 was to derive 
              these laws as consequences of a gravitational force acting between 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s and the sun. Newton tried to extend the solution to 
              three bodies (such as the combined <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>-moon-sun <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>), but failed 
              and concluded that the problem might be too hard to solve. This 
              was a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of more than passing curiosity because it was not known 
              if the solution of the three-body problem was stable, and hence 
              if there was a chance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> spiraling into the sun.</p>
<p>Little <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> was made on the problem for many years, until around 
              1890 the French mathematician Henri Poincar' was able to prove that 
              Newton's hunch was right. Poincar' showed that it was not possible 
              to write down a simple solution to the three-body problem. Lacking 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, he could only suspect what Lorenz was later able to see: 
              the solutions could not be written down because their behavior over 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was so complex. He also realized that this <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> would 
              cause the solutions to depend sensitively on any small changes. 
              A tiny nudge to one <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> would cause all of the trajectories to 
              completely change.</p>
<p>This behavior is familiar in an unstable <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, such as a pencil 
              that is balanced on its point and could fall in any direction. The 
              converse is a stable <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, such as the position of the pendulum 
              in a grandfather clock that hangs vertically if the clock is not 
              wound. Poincar' encountered, and Lorenz developed, the insight that 
              both behaviors could effectively occur at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The atmosphere 
              is not in danger of falling over like a pencil, but the flutter 
              of the smallest butterfly can get magnified to eventually change 
              the weather <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. This balance between divergence and convergence 
              we now call <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>.</p>
<p>Ordinary mathematical techniques fail on chaotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, which 
              appear to be random but are governed by simple rules. The discovery 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> held out the promise that simple explanations might be 
              lurking behind <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>'s apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. Otherwise eminent scientists 
              relaxed their usual critical faculties to embrace the idea. The 
              lure of this possibility led to the development of new <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s to 
              recognize and analyze <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. The most remarkable of these could 
              take almost any measured signal, such as the sound of a faucet dripping, 
              and reveal the behavior of the unseen parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> producing 
              the signal. When applied to a dripping faucet this technique did 
              in fact provide a beautiful explanation for the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s in what 
              had seemed to be just an annoying consequence of leaky washers. 
              After this result, the hunt was on to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, people found it everywhere. It was in the stars, 
              in the weather, in the oceans, in the body, in the markets. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s were used to test for <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> by counting how many variables 
              were needed to describe the observations; a complex signal that 
              could be explained by a small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of variables was the hallmark 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. Unfortunately, this <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> had one annoying feature. When 
              applied to a <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> that was too small or too noisy it could erroneously 
              conclude that anything was chaotic. This led to excesses such as 
              the <i>Economist</i> magazine reporting that "Mr. Peters thinks 
              that the S&amp;P 500 index has 2.33 <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> dimensions." This means 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> values of the stock market could be predicted given 
              just three previous values, a recipe for instant <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> if it wasn't 
              so obviously impossible. Such nonsensical conclusions were accepted 
              on the basis of the apparent authority of these <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">Chaos</a> has come to be associated with the study of anything complex, 
              but in fact the mathematical techniques are directly applicable 
              only to simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that appear to be complex. There has proved 
              to be a thin layer between <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that appear to be simple and 
              really are, and those that appear to be complex and really are. 
              The people who work on <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> are separating into two groups, one 
              that studies the exquisite <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> in the narrow class of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              where it does apply, and another that looks to use the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s developed 
              from the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> to help understand everything else. This 
              leaves behind the frequently noisy believers in "<a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">chaos theory</a>," 
              inspired but misled by the exciting labels.</p>
<p>They're matched in enthusiasm by the "agents" camp, proponents 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that learn user preferences and with some <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> 
              act on their behalf. The comforting images associated with an <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> 
              are a traditional English butler, or a favorite pet dog. Both learn 
              to respond to their master's wishes, even if the master is not aware 
              of expressing them. Nothing would be more satisfying than a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              butler that could fetch. Unfortunately, good help is as hard to 
              find in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world as it is in the physical one.</p>
<p>Agents must have a good <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a>. The widespread coverage of them 
              has done a great job of articulating the vision of what an <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a>
<i>should</i> be able to do, but it's been less good at covering 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of what agents <i>can</i> do. Whatever you call it, 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> is still a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. To write a good <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              you need to have <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able solutions to the interpretation of written 
              or spoken <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and perhaps video recognition so that it can 
              understand its instructions, routines for <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing through large 
              amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to find the relevant pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, cryptographic 
              schemes to manage <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to personal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, protocols that 
              allow commerce among agents and the traditional economy, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              graphics techniques to help make the results intelligible. These 
              are hard problems. Wanting to solve them is admirable, but naming 
              the solution is not the same as obtaining it.</p>
<p>Unlike what my confused industrial visitors <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, an <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> is 
              very much part of this world of <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming rather 
              than a superhuman visitor from a new world. The most successful 
              agents to date have bypassed many of these issues by leveraging 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to mediate interactions that would not happen 
              otherwise. Relatively simple <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s can look for people who express 
              similar preferences in some areas such as books or recordings, and 
              then make recommendations based on their previous choices. That's 
              a great thing to do, helping realize the promise of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 
              to build communities and connections among people instead of isolating 
              them, but then it becomes as much a question of sociology as <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              to understand how, where, and why people respond to each other's 
              choices.</p>
<p>If an <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> is ever to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> of a good butler, 
              it's natural to look to the butler's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> for insight into how 
              to do this. Compared to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is made out of slow, 
              imperfect <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, yet it is remarkably powerful, reliable, and 
              efficient. Unlike a conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, it can use continuous 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> values, and it takes advantage of an enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of simple 
              processing <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s working in parallel, the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. These are 
              "<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med" by varying the strength of the synaptic connections 
              among them. "<a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">Neural network</a>s" are mathematical models inspired by 
              the success of this <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1940s mathematical descriptions were developed for <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s 
              and their connections, suggesting that it might be possible to go 
              further to understand how <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s function. This agenda 
              encountered an apparently insurmountable obstacle in 1969 when Marvin 
              Minsky and <a class="thought" href="entries/papert_entry.html">Seymour Papert</a> proved that a layer of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s can <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> 
              only the simplest of functions between their inputs and outputs. 
              The strength of their result effectively halted <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> until the 
              1980s when a loophole was found by introducing <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s that are 
              connected only to other <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, not inputs or outputs. With such 
              a hidden layer it was shown that a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s could represent 
              any function.</p>
<p>Mathematical models traditionally have been based on finding the 
              values of adjustable <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s to most closely match a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of observations. 
              If a hidden layer is used in a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>, this is no longer 
              possible. It can be shown that there's no feasible way to choose 
              the best values for the connection strengths. This is <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous 
              to the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, where the very <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that makes the 
              equations impossible to solve makes them valuable to use. The behavior 
              of chaotic equations can be understood and applied even if it can't 
              be exactly predicted. Similarly, it turned out that hidden layers 
              can be used by <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able weights without trying to 
              find the best ones. Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s are so flexible, even a 
              less-than-ideal solution can be far more useful than the exact solution 
              of a less-capable model. As a consequence of this property, neural 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s using surprisingly simple <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> strategies were surprisingly 
              capable.</p>
<p>The combination of some early successes and <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that suggests 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s work the same way the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does led to the 
              misleading impression that the problem of making <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s think 
              had been solved. People still have to think to use a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>. 
              The power, and problems, of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s were amply demonstrated 
              in a study that I ran at the <a class="thought" href="entries/santa_fe_institute_entry.html">Santa Fe Institute</a>. It started with 
              a workshop that I attended there, exploring new mathematical techniques 
              for modeling complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. The meeting was distressingly anecdotal, 
              full of sweeping claims for new <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s but containing little in 
              the way of insight into how they fail or how they are related to 
              what is already known. In exasperation I made a <a class="thought" href="entries/joke_entry.html">joke</a> and suggested 
              that we should have a <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> analysis contest. No one laughed, and 
              in short <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/santa_fe_institute_entry.html">Santa Fe Institute</a> and NATO had agreed to support 
              it.</p>
<p>My colleague Andreas Weigend and I selected interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> sets 
              from many disciplines, giving the changes over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in a currency 
              exchange rate, the brightness of a <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>, the rhythm of a heartbeat, 
              and so forth. For extra credit we threw in the end of <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">Art</a> 
              of the Fugue</i>, the incomplete piece that Bach was writing when 
              he died. These <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> were distributed around the world through the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers were given quantitative questions appropriate 
              to each <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>, such as forecasting <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> values of the series. 
              These provided a way to make comparisons across disciplines independent 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> used to describe any particular technique.</p>
<p>From the responses I learned as much about the sociology of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              as I did about the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>. Some people told us that our study was 
              a mistake because <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is already too competitive and it's a 
              bad influence to try to make these comparisons; others told us that 
              our study was doomed because it's impossible to make these kinds 
              of comparisons. Both were saying that their work was not falsifiable. 
              Still others said that our study was the best thing that had happened 
              to the field, because they wanted to end the ambiguity of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> analysis 
              and find out which technique was the winner.</p>
<p>One of the problems presented <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> that was erratically 
              fluctuating on and off; the task was to predict how this <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              would continue after the end of the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>. Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> 
              was chaotic, traditional forecasting <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s would not do much better 
              than guessing randomly. Some of the entires that we received were 
              astoundingly good. One of the best used a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> to forecast 
              the series, and it was convincingly able to predict all of the new 
              behavior that it had not seen in the training <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. Here was a compelling 
              demonstration of the power of a neural net.</p>
<p>For comparison, one entry was done by eye, simply guessing what 
              would come next. Not surprisingly, this one did much worse than 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>. What was a surprise was that it beat some of 
              other entries by just as large a margin. One team spent hours of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> developing another <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> model; it performed 
              significantly worse than the visual inspection that took just a 
              few moments. The best and the worse <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s had similar 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s. Nothing about their descriptions would indicate the 
              enormous difference in their performance; that was a consequence 
              of the insight with which the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s were applied.</p>
<p>It should not be too unexpected that apparently similar neural 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s can behave so differently&#8212;the same is true of real 
              brains. As remarkable as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognition can be, some people are 
              more insightful than others. Starting with the same <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, they 
              differ in how they use it. Using a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> gives <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              the same opportunity to make mistakes that people have always enjoyed.</p>
<p>Many experts in <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s don't even study <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s 
              anymore. Neural nets provided the early lessons that started them 
              down the path of using flexible models that learn, but overcoming 
              the liabilities of neural nets has led them to leave behind any 
              presumption of modeling the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and focus directly on understanding 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. The essence of this lies in finding 
              better ways to manage the tension between <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> and beliefs.</p>
<p>One new technique on offer to do that is "<a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a>." It is sold 
              as an entirely new kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing that replaces the sharp <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a> 
              decisions forced by our Western style of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> with a more Eastern 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of shades of meaning that can better handle the ambiguity 
              of the real world. In defense of the West, we've known for a few 
              centuries how to use probability theory to represent uncertainty. 
              If you force a <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a>ian to write down the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s they 
              use, instead of telling you the words they attach to them, it turns 
              out that the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s are familiar ones with new names for the 
              terms. That itself is not so bad, but what is bad is that such naming 
              deflects attention away from the much better developed study of 
              probability theory.</p>
<p>This danger was on display at a conference I attended on the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> 
              of inference. A battle was raging there between the <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a> 
              camp and the old-fashioned probabilists. After repeatedly pushing 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a>ians to show anything at all that they could do that 
              could not be done with regular probability theory, the fuzzy side 
              pulled out their trump card and told the story of a Japanese helicopter 
              controller that didn't work until <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a> was used. Everyone 
              went home feeling that they had won the argument. Of course a demonstration 
              that something does work is far from proof that it works better 
              than, or even differently than, anything else. What's unfortunate 
              about this example is that perfectly intelligent people were swayed 
              by the label attached to the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> used in the helicopter rather 
              than doing the homework needed to understand how it works and how 
              it relates to what is already known. If they had done so, they might 
              have discovered that the nonfuzzy world has gone on <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> ever 
              more interesting and useful things about uncertainty.</p>
<p>Connecting all of these examples is a belief in magic <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              bullets, bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> that can solve the hard problems that had 
              stumped the experts who didn't know about <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s, or <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, 
              or agents. It's all too easy to defer <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> to a seductive <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. This happens on the biggest scales. At still one more conference 
              on mathematical modeling I sat through a long presentation by someone 
              from the Defense Department on how they are spending billions of 
              dollars a year on developing mathematical models to help them fight 
              wars. He described an elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/taxonomy_entry.html">taxonomy</a> of models of models of 
              models. Puzzled, at the end of it I hazarded to put up my hand and 
              ask a question that I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> would show everyone in the room that 
              I had slept through part of the talk (which I had). I wondered whether 
              he had any idea whether his billion-dollar models worked, since 
              it's not convenient to fight world wars to test them. His answer, 
              roughly translated, was to shrug and say that that's such a hard 
              question they don't worry about it. Meanwhile, the mathematicians 
              in the former Soviet Union labored with limited <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              and had no recourse but to think. As a result a surprising fraction 
              of modern mathematical theory came from the Soviet Union, far out 
              of proportion to its other technical contributions.</p>
<p>Where once we saw farther by standing on the shoulders of our predecessors, 
              in far too many cases we now see less by standing on our predecessors' 
              toes. You can't be interdisciplinary without the disciplines, and 
              without discipline. Each of the problematical terms I've discussed 
              is associated with a very good idea. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle of an idea, 
              there is a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to tenderly nurse the underlying spark of new insight, 
              and a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for it to grow up and face hard questions about how it 
              relates to what is already known, how it generalizes, and how it 
              can be used. Even if there aren't good answers, these ideas can 
              still be valuable for how they influence people to work on problems 
              that do lead to answers. The <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Age is now of an age that 
              deserves the same kind of healthy skepticism applied to the world 
              of bits that we routinely expect in the world of atoms.</p>
