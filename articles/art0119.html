<br><blockquote>The long habit of living indisposeth us for dying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sir THOMAS BROWNE</blockquote>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">CELL</a> REPAIR <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">MACHINE</a>S raise questions involving the value of extending <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. These are not the questions of today's medical <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>, which commonly involve dilemmas posed by scarce, costly, and half-effective treatments. They are instead questions involving the value of long, healthy lives achieved by inexpensive means.</p>
<p>&#160;For people who value <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and enjoy living, such questions may need no answer. But after a decade marked by concern about population <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, pollution, and resource depletion, many people may question the desirability of extending life; such concerns have fostered the spread of pro-<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> memes. These memes must be examined afresh, because many have roots in an obsolete worldview. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will change far more than just <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> lifespan.</p>
<p>&#160;We will gain the means not only to heal ourselves, but to heal <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> of the wounds we have inflicted. Since saving lives will increase the number of the living, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> raises questions about the effect of more people. Our ability to heal the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> will lessen one cause for controversy. &#160;</p>
<p>Still, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s themselves will surely stir controversy. They disturb traditional assumptions about our bodies and our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s: this makes doubt soothing. They will require several major breakthroughs: this makes doubt easy. Since the possibility or impossibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s raises important issues, it makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to consider what objections might be raised.</p><h1>Why <i>Not</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> Repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s?</h1><p>What sort of argument could suggest that <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are impossible? A successful argument must manage some strange contortions. It must somehow hold that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s cannot build and repair cells, while granting that the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in our bodies actually <i>do</i> build and repair cells every day. A cruel problem for the committed skeptic! True, artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s must do what natural <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s fail to do, but they need not do anything <i>qualitatively</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>. Both natural and artificial repair <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s must reach, identify, and rebuild molecular structures. We will be able to improve on existing <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> repair enzymes simply by comparing several <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> strands at once, so <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> obviously hasn't found all the tricks. Since this example explodes any general argument that repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s cannot improve on <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, a good case against <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s seems difficult to make. &#160;</p>
<p>Still, two general questions deserve direct answers. First, why should we expect to achieve long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the coming decades, when people have tried and failed for millennia? Second, if we can indeed use <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to extend lives, then why hasn't <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> (which has been repairing cells for billions of years) already perfected them?</p>
<p>&#160;People have tried and failed.</p>
<p>&#160;For centuries, people have longed to escape their short <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans. Every so often, a Ponce de Leon or a quack doctor has promised a potion, but it has never worked. These statistics of failure have persuaded some people that, since all attempts have failed, all always will fail. They say "Aging is natural," and to them that seems <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> enough. Medical advances may have shaken their views, but advances have chiefly reduced early <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, not extended maximum <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-span.</p>
<p>&#160;But now biochemists have gone to work examining the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that build, repair, and control cells. They have learned to assemble viruses and reprogram <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. For the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, people are examining their <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and unraveling the molecular secrets of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. It seems that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will eventually combine improved biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> with improved molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to repair damaged tissue structures and so rejuvenate them. This is nothing strange - it would be strange, rather, if such powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and abilities did <i>not</i> bring dramatic results. The massive statistics of past failure are simply irrelevant, because we have never before tried to build <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Nature has tried and failed.</p>
<p>&#160;Nature <i>has</i> been building <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> has tinkered with multicelled <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s for hundreds of millions of years, yet advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s all age and die, because <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>'s nanomachines repair cells imperfectly. Why should improvements be possible?</p>
<p>&#160;Rats mature in months, and then age and die in about two years - yet <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings have evolved to live over thirty times longer. If longer lives were the chief goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, then rats would live longer too. But durability has costs: to repair cells requires an investment in <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, materials, and repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Rat genes direct rat bodies to invest in swift <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and reproduction, not in meticulous self-repair. A rat that dallied in reaching breeding size would run a greater risk of becoming a <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> snack first. Rat genes have prospered by treating rat bodies as cheap throwaways. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> genes likewise discard <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, though after a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> a few dozen times longer than a rat's.</p>
<p>&#160;But shoddy repairs are not the only cause of aging. Genes turn egg cells into adults through a pattern of development which rolls forward at fairly steady speed. This pattern is fairly consistent because <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> seldom changes a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> design. Just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> pattern of the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> froze several billions of years ago, so the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> pattern of chemical signals and tissue responses that guides <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian development jelled many millions of years ago. That process apparently has a clock, <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to run at different speeds in different <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that runs out.</p>
<p>&#160;Whatever the causes of aging, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has had little <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to eliminate them. If genes built individuals able to stay healthy for millennia, they would gain little advantage in their "effort" to replicate. Most individuals would still die young from starvation, predation, accident, or disease. As Sir Peter Medawar points out, a gene that helps the young (who are many) but harms the old (who are few) will replicate well and so spread through the population. If enough such genes accumulate, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s become <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to die. &#160;</p>
<p>Experiments by Dr. Leonard Hayflick suggest that cells contain "clocks" that count <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> divisions and stop the division process when the count gets too high. A mechanism of this sort can help young <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s: if <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>-like changes make a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> divide too rapidly, but fail to destroy its clock, then it will grow to a tumor of limited size. The clock would thus prevent the unlimited <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of a true <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>. Such clocks could harm older <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s by stopping the division of normal cells, ending tissue renewal, The <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> thus would benefit from reduced <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> rates when young, yet have cause to complain if it lives to grow old. But its genes won't listen - they will have jumped ship earlier, as copies passed to the next generation. With <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s we will be able to reset such clocks. Nothing suggests that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has perfected our bodies even by the brute standard of survival and reproduction. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers don't wire <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with slow, <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a>-like fibers or build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s out of soft <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, and for good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. Genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> (unlike memetic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>) has been unable to leap to new materials or new <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, but has instead refined and extended the old ones. &#160;</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s fall far short of the limits of the possible - they don't even have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to direct them. The lack of nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in cells, of course, shows only that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s couldn't (or simply <i>didn't</i>) evolve gradually from other molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> has failed to build the best possible <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but there have been ample <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s.</p><h1>Healing And Protecting The <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a></h1><p>The failure of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to adapt to the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a> is also easy to understand. From deforestation to dioxin, we have caused damage faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> can respond. As we have sought more food, goods, and services, our use of bulk <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has forced us to continue such damage. With <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, though, we will be able to do more good for ourselves, yet do less harm to the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. In addition, we will be able to build <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>-mending <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to correct damage already done. Cells are not all we will want to repair.</p>
<p>&#160;Consider the toxic waste problem. Whether in our air, soil, or water, wastes concern us because they can harm living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. But any materials that come in contact with the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> can themselves be reached by other forms of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. This means that we will be able to design cleaning <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to remove these poisons wherever they could harm <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Some wastes, such as dioxin, consist of dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s made of innocuous atoms. Cleaning <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will render them harmless by rearranging their atoms. Other wastes, such as lead and radioactive isotopes, contain dangerous atoms. Cleaning <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will collect these for disposal in any one of several ways. Lead comes from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s rocks; <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s could build it into rocks in the mines from which it came. Radioactive isotopes could also be isolated from living things, either by building them into stable rock or by more drastic means. Using cheap, reliable <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> transportation <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, we could bury them in the dead, dry rock of the Moon. Using nanomachines, we could seal them in self-repairing, self-sealing containers the size of hills and powered by desert sunlight. These would be more secure than any passive rock or cask.</p>
<p>&#160;With replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, we will even be able to remove the billions of tons of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide that our fuel-burning <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> has dumped into the atmosphere. Climatologists project that climbing <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide levels, by trapping solar <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, will partially melt the polar caps, raising sea levels and flooding coasts sometime in the middle of the next century. Replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, though, will make solar power cheap enough to eliminate the need for fossil fuels. Like trees, solar-powered nanomachines will be able to extract <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide from the air and split off the <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>. Unlike trees, they will be able to grow deep storage roots and place <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> back in the coal seams and oil fields from which it came.</p>
<p>&#160;Future <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>-healing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will also help us mend torn landscapes and restore damaged ecosystems. Mining has scraped and pitted the Earth; carelessness has littered it. Fighting forest fires has let undergrowth thrive, replacing the cathedral-like openness of ancient forests with scrub <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> that feeds more dangerous fires. We will use inexpensive, sophisticated robots to reverse these effects and others. Able to move rock and soil, they will re-contour torn lands. Able to weed and digest, they will simulate the clearing effects of natural forest fires without danger or devastation. Able to lift and move trees, they will thin thick stands and reforest bare hills. We will make squirrel-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with a taste for old trash. We will make treelike <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with roots that spread deep and cleanse the soil of pesticides and excess acid. We will make <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>-sized lichen cleaners and spray-paint nibblers. We will make whatever <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s we need to clean up the mess left by twentieth-century <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;After the cleanup, we will recycle most of these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, keeping only those we still need to protect the environment from a cleaner <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> based on molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. These more lasting <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will supplement natural ecosystems wherever needed, to balance and heal the effects of humanity. To make them effective, harmless, and hidden will be a craft requiring not just automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, but <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> and a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;With <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we will even be able to return some <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> from apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>. The African quagga - a zebra-like <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> - became extinct over a century ago, but a salt-preserved quagga pelt survived in a German museum. Alan Wilson of the University of California at Berkeley and his co-workers have used enzymes to extract <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> fragments from muscle tissue attached to this pelt. They cloned the fragments in <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, compared them to zebra <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, and found (as expected) that the genes showed a close <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary relationship. They have also succeeded in extracting and replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from a century-old bison pelt and from millennia-old mammoths preserved in the arctic permafrost. This success is a far cry from cloning a whole <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> or organism - cloning one gene leaves about 100,000 uncloned, and cloning every gene still doesn't repair a single <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> - but it does show that the hereditary material of these <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> still survives.</p>
<p>&#160;As I described in the last chapter, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that compare several damaged copies of a <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> will be able to reconstruct an undamaged original - and the billions of cells in a dried skin contain <i>billions</i> of copies. From these, we will be able to reconstruct undamaged <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, and around the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> we will be able to construct undamaged cells of whatever type we desire. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> pass through winter as egg cells, to be revived by the warmth of spring. These "extinct" <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> will pass through the twentieth century as skin and muscle cells, to be converted into fertile eggs and revived by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Dr. Barbara Durrant, a reproductive physiologist at the San Diego Zoo, is preserving tissue samples from endangered <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in a cryogenic freezer. The payoff may be greater than most people now expect. Preserving just tissue samples doesn't preserve the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> or an ecosystem, but it does preserve the genetic heritage of the sampled <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. We would be reckless if we failed to take out this insurance policy against the permanent loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. The prospect of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s thus affects our choices today.</p>
<p>&#160;Extinction is not a new problem. About 65 million years ago, most then-existing <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> vanished, including all <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of dinosaur. In <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s book of stone, the story of the dinosaurs ends on a page consisting of a thin layer of clay. The clay is rich in iridium, an <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> common in asteroids and comets. The best current theory indicates that a blast from the sky smashed <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s biosphere. With the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> of a hundred million megatons of TNT, it spread dust and an "asteroidal winter" <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>-wide. &#160;</p>
<p>In the eons since living cells first banded together to form worms, <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> has suffered five great <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>s. Only 34 million years ago - some 30 million years after the dinosaurs died - a layer of glassy beads settled to the sea floor. Above that layer the fossils of many <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> vanish. These beads froze from the molten splash of an impact. &#160;</p>
<p>Meteor Crater, in Arizona, bears witness to a smaller, more recent blast equaling that of a four-megaton bomb. As recently as June 30, 1908, a ball of fire split the Siberian sky and blasted the forest flat across an area a hundred kilometers wide. &#160;</p>
<p>As people have long suspected, the dinosaurs died because they were stupid. Not that they were too stupid to feed, walk, or guard their eggs - they did survive for 140 million years - they were merely too stupid to build telescopes able to detect asteroids and spacecraft able to deflect them from collision with <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> has more rocks to throw at us, but we are showing signs of adequate <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to deal with them. When <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering give us a more capable <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we will find it easy to track and deflect asteroids; in fact, we could do it with <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> available today. We can both heal <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> and protect it.</p><h1>Long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> and Population Pressure</h1><p>People commonly seek long, healthy lives, yet the prospect of a dramatic success is unsettling. Might greater longevity harm the quality of life? How will the prospect of long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> affect our immediate problems? Though most effects cannot be foreseen, some can.</p>
<p>&#160;For example, as <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s extend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, they will increase population. If all else were equal, more people would mean greater crowding, pollution, and scarcity - but all else will <i>not</i> be equal: the very advances in automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> that will bring <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will also help us heal the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, protect it, and live more lightly upon it. We will be able to produce our necessities and luxuries without polluting our air, land, or water. We will be able to get resources and make things without scarring the landscape with mines or cluttering it with factories. With efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s making durable products, we will produce things of greater value with less waste. More people will be able to live on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, yet do less harm to it - or to one another, if we somehow manage to use our new abilities for good ends.</p>
<p>&#160;If one were to see the night sky as a black wall and expect the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race to screech to a polite halt, then it would be natural to fear that long-lived people would be a burden on the "poor, crowded world of our children." This fear stems from the illusion that <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is a zero-sum game, that having more people always means slicing a small pie thinner. But when we become able to repair cells, we will also be able to build replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and excellent spacecraft. Our "poor" descendants will share a world the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>, with <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, and potential living <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> dwarfing our entire <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;This will open room enough for an era of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and prosperity far beyond any precedent. Yet the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a> itself is finite, and the stars are distant. On <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, even the cleanest <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>-based industries will produce waste heat. Concern about population and resources will remain important because the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of replicators (such as people) can eventually overrun any finite resource base.</p>
<p>&#160;But does this mean that we should sacrifice lives to delay the crunch? A few people may volunteer themselves, but they will do little good. In truth, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> will have little effect on the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> problem: <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> will remain exponential whether people die young or live indefinitely. A martyr, by dying early, could delay the crisis by a fraction of a second - but a halfway dedicated person could help more by joining a movement of long-lived people working to solve this long-range problem. After all, many people have ignored the limits to <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. Who but the long-lived will prepare for the firmer but more distant limits to <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in the world beyond Earth? Those concerned with long-term limits will serve humanity best by staying alive, to keep their concern alive.</p>
<p>&#160;Long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> also raises the threat of cultural stagnation. If this were an inevitable problem of long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, it is unclear what one could do about it - <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-gun the old for holding firm opinions, perhaps? Fortunately, two factors will reduce the problem somewhat. First, in a world with an open frontier the young will be able to move out, build new worlds, test new ideas, and then either persuade their elders to change or leave them behind. Second, people old in years will be young in body and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Aging slows both <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, as it slows other physical processes; rejuvenation will speed them again. Since youthful muscles and sinews make young bodies more flexible, perhaps youthful <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> tissues will keep minds somewhat more flexible, even when steeped in long years of <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>.</p><h1>The Effects of Anticipation</h1><p>Long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> will not be the greatest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>'s problems. It might even help solve them. &#160;</p>
<p>Consider its effect on people's willingness to start wars. Aging and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> have made slaughter in combat more acceptable: As Homer had Sarpedon, hero of Troy, say, "O my friend, if we, leaving this war, could escape from age and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, I should not here be fighting in the van; but now, since many are the modes of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> impending over us which no man can hope to shun, let us press on and give renown to other men, or win it for ourselves." &#160;</p>
<p>Yet if the hope of escaping age and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> turns people from battle, will this be good? It might discourage small wars that could grow into a nuclear holocaust. But equally, it might weaken our resolve to defend ourselves from lifelong oppression - if we take no account of how much more <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> we have to defend. The reluctance of others to die for their ruler's power will help.</p>
<p>&#160;Expectations always shape <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. Our institutions and personal plans both reflect our expectation that all adults now living will die in mere decades. Consider how this belief inflames the urge to acquire, to ignore the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> in pursuit of a fleeting pleasure. Consider how it blinds us to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, and obscures the long-term benefits of cooperation. Erich Fromm writes: "If the individual lived five hundred or one thousand years, this clash (between his interests and those of society) might not exist or at least might be considerably reduced. He then might live and harvest with joy what he sowed in sorrow; the suffering of one historical period which will bear fruit in the next one could bear fruit for him too." Whether or not most people will still live for the present is beside the point: the question is, might there be a <i>significant</i> change for the better?</p>
<p>&#160;The expectation of living a long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in a better <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> may well make some political diseases less deadly. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> conflicts are far too deep and strong to be uprooted by any simple change, yet the prospect of vast wealth tomorrow may at least <i>lessen</i> the urge to fight over crumbs today. The problem of conflict is great, and we need all the help we can get. &#160;</p>
<p>The prospect of personal deterioration and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> has always made <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> less pleasant. Visions of pollution, poverty, and nuclear annihilation have recently made <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> almost too gruesome to bear. Yet with at least a hope of a better <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to enjoy it, we may look forward more willingly. Looking forward, we will see more. Having a personal stake, we will care more. Greater hope and foresight will benefit both the present and posterity; they will even better our odds of survival. &#160;</p>
<p>Lengthened lives will mean more people, but without greatly worsening tomorrow's population problem. The expectation of longer lives in a better world will bring real benefits, by encouraging people to give more <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Overall, long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and its anticipation seem good for society, just as shortening <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans to thirty would be bad. Many people want long, healthy lives for themselves. What are the prospects for the present generation?</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">Life Extension</a></h1><p>Hear Gilgamesh, King of Uruk:</p>
<blockquote>"I have looked over the wall and I see the bodies floating on the river, and that will be my lot also. Indeed I know it is so, for whoever is tallest among men cannot reach the heavens, and the greatest cannot encompass the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>."</blockquote>
<p>Four millennia have passed since Sumerian scribes marked clay tablets to record <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, and times have changed. Men no taller than average have now reached the heavens and circled the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. We of the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Age, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a> Age, the Age of Breakthroughs - need we still despair before the barrier of years? Or will we learn the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> soon enough to save ourselves and those we <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> from dissolution?</p>
<p>&#160;The pace of biomedical advance holds tantalizing promise. The major diseases of age - heart disease, stroke, and <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> - have begun to yield to treatment. Studies of aging mechanisms have begun to bear fruit, and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have extended <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s' <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans. As <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> builds on <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and tools lead to new tools, advances seem sure to accelerate. Even without <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, we have <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to expect major <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward slowing and partially reversing aging.</p>
<p>&#160;Although people of all ages will benefit from these advances, the young will benefit more. Those surviving long enough will reach a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when aging becomes fully reversible: at the latest, the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Then, if not sooner, people will grow healthier as they grow older, improving like wine instead of spoiling like milk. They will, if they choose, regain excellent health and live a long, long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;In that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, with its replicators and cheap spaceflight, people will have both long lives and room and resources enough to enjoy them. A question that may roll bitterly off the tongue is: "When?... Which will be the last generation to age and die, and which the first to win through?" Many people now share the quiet expectation that aging will someday be conquered. But are those now alive doomed by a fluke of premature birth? The answer will prove both clear and startling. &#160;</p>
<p>The obvious path to long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> involves living long enough to be rejuvenated by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Advances in biochemistry and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will extend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and in the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> won they will extend it yet more. At first we will use drugs, diet, and exercise to extend healthy <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Within several decades, advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will likely bring early <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s - and with the aid of automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, early <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s may promptly be followed by advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Dates must remain mere guesses, but a guess will serve better than a simple question mark.</p>
<p>&#160;Imagine someone who is now thirty years old. In another thirty years, <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> will have advanced greatly, yet that thirty-year-old will be only sixty. Statistical tables which assume <i>no</i> advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> say that a thirty-year-old U.S. citizen can now expect to live almost <i>fifty</i> more years - that is, well into the 2030s. Fairly routine advances (of sorts demonstrated in <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s) seem likely to add years, perhaps decades, to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> by 2030. The mere beginnings of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> might extend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> by several decades. In short, the <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> of 2010, 2020, and 2030 seems likely to extend our thirty-year-old's <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> into the 2040s and 2050s. By then, if not before, medical advances may permit actual rejuvenation. Thus, those under thirty (and perhaps those substantially older) can look forward - at least tentatively - to <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>'s overtaking their aging process and delivering them safely to an era of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair, vigor, and indefinite <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-span. &#160;</p>
<p>If this were the whole story, then the division between the last on the road to early <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> and the first on the road to long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> would be perhaps the ultimate gap between generations. What is more, a gnawing uncertainty about one's own <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> would give <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to push the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> into the subconscious dungeon of disturbing speculations.</p>
<p>&#160;But is this really our situation? There seems to be another way to save lives, one based on <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, yet applicable today. As the last chapter described, repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to heal tissue so long as its essential structure is preserved. A tissues ability to metabolize and to repair itself becomes unimportant; the discussion of <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> illustrated this. <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">Biostasis</a>, as described, will use molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to stop function and preserve structure by cross-linking the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to one another. Nanomachines will reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> by repairing molecular damage, removing cross-links, and helping cells (and hence tissues, organs, and the whole body) return to normal function.</p>
<p>&#160;Reaching an era with advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> repair <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s seems the key to long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and health, because almost all physical problems will then be curable. One might manage to arrive in that era by remaining alive and active through all the years between now and then - but this is merely the most obvious way, the way that requires a minimum of foresight. Patients today often suffer a collapse of heart function while the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> structures that embody <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and personality remain intact. In such cases, might not <i>today's</i> medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> be able to stop <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes in a way that <i>tomorrow's</i> medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be able to reverse? If so, then most deaths are now prematurely diagnosed, and needless.</p>
