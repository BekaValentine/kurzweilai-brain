<div class="TeaserText">The criminal potentials inherent in molecular manufacturing include powerful new illegal drugs, mass murder via compromised assembly codes, and a "killer virus" crossing out of cyberspace into the physical realm. A criminal-justice futurist examines the possibilities. 
</div>
<br>
<br> On top of my physical desk sits 
            a copy of <i>Pandaemonium: The Coming of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> as Seen by Contemporary 
            Observers, 1660-1886</i>, Humphrey Jennings&#8217; &#8220;imaginative 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>.&#8221; On my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> desktop 
            are essays by the authors of this volume (and the previous one<sup>1</sup>), 
            the possible precursors of <i>Pan-nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/daemon_entry.html">daemon</a>ium: The Coming of the 
            Micro-Machine</i>. 
            <p>In one of those essays, &#8220;The Need for Limits,&#8221; Chris 
              Phoenix speaks of <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a> in terms of a <a class="thought" href="entries/synergy_entry.html">synergy</a>: enhanced 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> with machines, partially supporting a philosophical 
              examination of the human condition. Though certainly that, the Enlightenment 
              also was a watershed period when the economic foundations of the 
              European economy changed, and the authority of Revealed Truth was 
              forced to contend with the authority of Rational <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a> and its 
              practical cousin, Scientific Inquiry. The shifts in the economy 
              created a massive transformation of social <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, from <a class="thought" href="entries/agrarian_entry.html">agrarian</a> to 
              urban. The current era has parallels to all of these forces, movements 
              already in play but not yet complete...and in some cases not fully 
              articulated.</p>
<p>As a peripheral member of a <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s group<sup>2</sup> in my professional 
              field (policing, and more broadly, criminal justice), I have noticed 
              that futurists tend to be concerned with the end results of trends, 
              the state of things ten, twenty, or fifty years from now. By contrast, 
              I am more concerned with the collateral damage we may sustain in 
              the process of getting to those <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> states from where we are 
              now.</p>
<p>This essay approaches that interstitial state in four sections. 
              The first section looks at the control of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; the second, 
              for the criminal potentials inherent in it. Using the template of 
              the Enlightenment, the third section looks at the darker channels 
              of social transformation, particularly the impact on work and social 
              worth. The fourth section draws an admittedly leap-of-faith parallel 
              between the Enlightenment&#8217;s impact on religious authority, 
              and technology&#8217;s impact upon the authority of economic capital 
              and law.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> holds remarkable potential to change the world, 
              but like most recent technologies, it emerges within a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              of laws, codes of conduct, and social expectations developed for 
              previous capacities. Those mechanisms will shape its emerging uses, 
              possibly retarding or constraining the applications of the technology 
              in undesirable ways. At issue is whether micro-level processing 
              will be merely one more tool (and thus alter our lives incrementally), 
              or a Promethean breakthrough that will alter human <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> in 
              profound ways. My interest, as one who stands outside the Halls 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> looking in, tends to center on the possibilities that 
              I can understand from a layman&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>Trying to grasp in layman&#8217;s terms the implications of a new 
              and only marginally understood technology leads to a <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ies, framing the new in terms of the familiar (for good or 
              ill).</p>
<h4>Control</h4>
<p>As a non-scientist, the most <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> question for me is, &#8220;When 
              do I get to play with the new toy?&#8221; Given the general limits 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> use of nanotechnology, the first new toy that will 
              become available to me most likely will be the desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>, 
              or personal nanofactory (PN).</p>
<p>The most <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able members of CRN&#8217;s Global Task Force<sup>3</sup> 
              have engaged in a lengthy discussion about desktop manufacturing 
              and its social consequences, and as of this writing, there seems 
              to be a lack of consensus about the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, and thus the full 
              impact, of PNs. If we accept the position of the optimists, and 
              expect fully-capable <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to be available in the not-too-distant 
              future, secondary questions arise: Will the devices be provided 
              in fully-capable form (probably transformative), or will their functionality 
              be curtailed in defense of the corporate profits to be derived from 
              them? If the latter, how will control be maintained? Some answers 
              are perhaps to be found in current trends, since the courts often 
              look to historical analogs in dealing with new issues.</p>
<p>If we posit that desktop manufacturing becomes widely available, 
              as seems inevitable, the dominant forces of the economy have two 
              avenues of recourse to maintain control over the new technology 
              for monetary benefit. The first will be the control of raw materials 
              for molecular assembly, which appears to share the delivery profile 
              of heating fuels in contemporary life. More <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant is the second 
              area, already suggested by Phoenix: <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a>s.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>The development of nanotechnology is taking place within a corporate 
              nest of ideas and resources (much like licensed computer <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              development), with some independent <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers and consortia operating 
              on a freeware basis. Molecular assembly at any sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> level will require <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s to guide assembly, and 
              these are likely to be controlled by patents. The majority of patents 
              are almost certain to be controlled by corporate interests. Renewable 
              user site licenses, comparable to commercial software packages, 
              are the most likely form of retaining economic benefit for a corporate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>. One of the possible ways of maintaining economic control 
              over site licenses would be some form of cyber-degradable <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              that self-destructs after a finite period, and must be renewed. 
              For example, a user could <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> (or purchase on a one-use or 
              renewable-use <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>) the <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> that would allow the manufacture 
              of only a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of rolls of toilet paper by a personal 
              nanofactory.</p>
<p>Patents and the fundamental premises of <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> are 
              already under challenge, but the challenges have been met with an 
              equally strong legal response anchored in precedent. The courts 
              have handed the reins of control over <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> recordings of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>-making machinery behind the popular songs through conservative 
              interpretation of intellectual property statutes. The huge profits 
              to be made from licensing technological advancements for industry 
              virtually assures that the field of nanotechnology will be similarly 
              bound.</p>
<p>The most recent Promethean technology, file-sharing, theoretically 
              stood to liberate music from the chains of capital. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/napster_entry.html">Napster</a>, 
              Kaaza, Grokster, and their lesser clones have lost the legal battles, 
              and the technology has been co-opted by industry giants into new 
              distribution-for-profit mechanisms. Corporations and universities 
              alike write eminent <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> over patents and patentable discoveries 
              into their employment contracts, and genetic patterns and discoveries 
              are subject to copyright. Unknown garage bands and the metaphorical 
              garage workshops of independent researchers still can be found beyond 
              the current reach of over-grasping capital, but only until they 
              become good or useful enough to attract attention.</p>
<p>As new genetic &#8220;building block&#8221; discoveries and other 
              chemical compounds are placed under patent, the copyright has become 
              the new castle moat or the new dog in the manger (depending upon 
              one&#8217;s perspective), intended to keep easily-duplicated &#8220;properties&#8221; 
              under the control of their owners. <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">Paradox</a>ically, only those products 
              deemed legitimate are defended by patents and lawsuits so vigorously; 
              illegal products and contraband are not. Corporate interests have 
              far deeper pockets and a true metric for measuring loss and injury. 
              There is greater <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> in the illicit trades, where control of 
              trafficked, harmful <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s rests with hugely inefficient, underfunded, 
              and understaffed public enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The exponential explosion of child <a class="thought" href="entries/pornography_entry.html">pornography</a> (and its hate- and 
              racial supremacy-based counterparts) over the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is a cautionary 
              tale in its own right. Like the illicit drug trade in the physical 
              world, neither child porn nor hate-mongering is impervious to law 
              enforcement efforts, but the occasional victories of enforcement 
              seem to have little long-term effect on the larger industry or movement. 
              The underground distribution of molecular patterns for assembly 
              might easily be accomplished by the same mechanisms, like the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> codes that any script-kiddie can download, tinker with, and 
              release back into the wild.</p>
<p>While the first generation of personal nanofactories probably will 
              come with a fixed number of pre-programmed patterns, market forces 
              will demand versatility. Units will need a capacity to acquire new 
              assembly patterns as they are developed, and there seem to be few 
              options beyond what is now available for computer <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. Patterns 
              may be downloaded over hardwired or Wi-Fi <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, or be manually 
              transferred by whatever media replace the current disk drives and 
              <a class="thought" href="#">flash</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> sticks. Each format would spawn a black market of unknown 
              proportions, and with the black markets come the accompanying risks 
              of epidemic and pandemic consequences of criminal use.</p>
<h4>Criminal Potentials</h4>
<p>We should anticipate that a new drug industry will piggyback on 
              the basic molecular assembly <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>, and the potential implications 
              for the social fabric are enormous. One of the most desirable benefits 
              of nanotechnology is that of precise targeting of therapeutic drugs; 
              however, the same technology will have associated benefits for illegal 
              pharmacopoeia. While the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the patterns most likely 
              will delay this until a second or third-level level of PN development, 
              once the basic patterns for <a class="thought" href="entries/psychotropic_entry.html">psychotropic</a> drugs are understood and 
              the assembly technology sufficiently enabled, individual drug manufacture 
              is almost certain to become a social tsunami. There are strong analogies 
              to the current methamphetamine epidemic: less than two decades ago, 
              the manufacture of crystal methamphetamine required a well-equipped 
              clandestine lab, a chemist, a criminal organization for protection 
              and distribution. Today, meth is the new bathtub gin, easily made 
              in any number of Rube Goldberg processes in basements, trailers, 
              campers, garages, or pickup trucks. </p>
<p>Unlike methamphetamine, a micro-assembly drug manufacture process 
              would need only the basic molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, not the more elaborate 
              precursor chemicals (like pseudoephedrine) whose control is now 
              part of our anti-drug strategy. That suggests a much greater availability, 
              with corollary hazards of greater social <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation and conceivably 
              even poly-drug experimentation. The toxic byproducts of meth labs 
              are threats to law enforcement agencies, the families of meth addicts, 
              and neighborhoods. We do not yet know the degree to which micro-manufacture 
              byproducts will be toxic, if at all. </p>
<p>Illicit micro-manufacture may be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, 
              effectively eliminating organized crime from the market may lessen 
              the toxic effects of the war on drugs: the corruption involved with 
              importation of drugs, and the violence of competing drug markets. 
              At least potentially, even the criminogenic <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of drug dependency 
              may be lessened: since the base materials would likely be the same 
              as for legitimate micro-manufacture, it is less likely that a specialized, 
              higher-priced supply chain would be necessary. The <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> of that 
              supply chain create additional crimes: violence among criminal enterprises 
              competing for turf high, and both personal and property crime committed 
              by addicts desperate to meet the dealer&#8217;s price. Absent the 
              supply market, the cost of personally manufactured drugs would be 
              cheaper, and the risks of their creation considerably lower in terms 
              of legal discovery and interdiction. However, the potential free 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to addictive and <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>-altering substances will almost certainly 
              exacerbate the social problems associated with the addictions and 
              dependencies that result. The same delivery <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> could surreptitiously 
              create markets for new designer drugs, addictive and involuntarily 
              piggybacked on legitimately disseminated nanoproduct codes. The 
              number of &#8220;what ifs&#8221; that need to be resolved before either 
              scenario happens leave the possibilities within the realm of fiction 
              for now, but if the analogies to the Internet hold true, they must 
              be anticipated as a contingency.</p>
<p>Should we ever develop a drug-based cure for the addictions, of 
              course, it might be to our collective advantage to attempt to disseminate 
              it via whatever outlaw networks and mechanisms develop, the angelic 
              counterpart to the demonic assault-by-micro-drugs of the original 
              scenario. Therapeutic nano-rehab, even at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of a medical 
              crisis, may not be sufficient to stem the drug crisis, however. 
              Involuntary detoxification has a poor history of neutralizing the 
              psychological dependencies that drive post-sobriety returns to addictive 
              substances. The &#8220;evil twin&#8221; of involuntary detoxification 
              is involuntary addiction.</p>
<p>Lurking beyond therapeutic use is the possibility of totalitarian 
              control using the same methods. The Promethean paradox that attends 
              all new technologies is even more pronounced for those that escape 
              Newtonian-level detection. Medical research is racing ahead in its 
              understanding of neural processes, including the sites in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              responsible for certain behaviors. As <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> develops capacities 
              for intervening in psychological dependencies or other maladies, 
              it also develops the capacity for inducing mind control or other 
              forms of incapacitation.</p>
<p>Downstream, there is also the potential for mass murder via compromised 
              assembly codes. In the physical world, tainting a <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> with 
              poison can only be done efficiently at the factory source, and even 
              then must bypass or defeat stringent quality control measures. Any 
              other corruption can take place only on a relatively small scale. 
              The introduction of a virulent and unsuspected corruption of a drug 
              assembly code is not so limited. It shares more in common with the 
              computer virus than the Tylenol poisoner. Since black market codes 
              originate and enter the data stream outside the domain of legitimate 
              quality control measures, and the drug-using community is unlikely 
              to give designer drug codes great scrutiny (at least in the initial 
              rounds), &#8220;massassination&#8221; (mass assassination or &#8220;pharmaceutical 
              cleansing&#8221;) via bogus codes is a distinct possibility in a 
              networked distribution system. It would challenge both medical institutions 
              and law enforcement agents. It is admittedly an outside possibility, 
              requiring a rare combination of technological savvy and social alienation, 
              but the world since September 2001 has been dealing with more and 
              more &#8220;one in a bazillion&#8221; scenarios. Nothing should be 
              taken off the table in terms of exploring, and preparing for, unpleasant 
              misappropriation of technology.</p>
<p>To a certain degree, the massassination scenario depends upon the 
              nature of the dissemination of manufacture codes. The most logical 
              assumption is that distribution of product blueprints for desktop 
              manufacturing will be done via the Internet or its successor entity. 
              The current attempts to defeat music and film pirate copies would 
              have serious analogs in any new process that challenged traditional 
              sources of corporate and investment income, especially unrestricted 
              use of molecular assembly technology. The Spy vs. Spy battle between 
              corporate interests and hacktivism will doubtless continue in the 
              nano- and micro-arenas as in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>. Even if controls evolve 
              another way, such as physical distribution of codes on one-use portable 
              media like the flash memory stick, markets for stolen and counterfeit 
              products will emerge, just as the current computer viruses and malware 
              are piggybacked on the legitimate use of the Internet. Beating security 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a>s to transform a one-use code into a version capable of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> dissemination will be an instant challenge for the criminal 
              and black-hat hacking communities.</p>
<p>There are some differences, though. While the viruses and Trojan 
              horses that hector cyberspace have consequences ranging from irritating 
              (the Blue Screen of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a>) to life-changing (severe financial crises 
              resulting from <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> theft), it is only at the most extreme range 
              that they could be considered life-threatening. Identity theft that 
              labels an innocent citizen as a dangerous criminal has some potential 
              for creating life-threatening situations, but most of the jeopardy 
              is financial or social. Viruses and worms may take down a network 
              or three, or transform the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> into the World Wide Wait 
              with deleterious consequences for commerce, but they do not directly 
              assault the networks&#8217; users. A corrupted, mislabeled, or maliciously 
              designed micro-manufacture code could &#8220;break the fourth wall,&#8221; 
              crossing out of cyberspace into the physical realm.</p>
<p>The closest parallel in the physical world, the batch of bad heroin 
              that kills users in clusters, does not really provide an accurate 
              analog for a malicious assembly code incident. Relatively few seek 
              heroin under any circumstances, and no one but the most desperate 
              heroin addict would seek out bad heroin (as has happened in some 
              isolated cases). The first &#8220;killer virus&#8221; loose in whatever 
              network provides product codes for PNs will affect hundreds and 
              perhaps thousands of innocents, whether it comes as a terrorist 
              strike or an unintended consequence of a hacking adventure. No one 
              will have to seek it: once in the wild, it will arrive unbidden 
              in the In Box.</p>
<p>Defenses to such a scenario potentially exist, but security measures 
              are one of the most attractive fruits of the Tree of Knowledge. 
              Like contemporary Internet defenses, and the laws passed to outlaw 
              new designer drugs, defensive maneuvers almost always stimulate 
              new offensive attacks. Any combination of zeros and ones, in any 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a> medium, can be hijacked and compromised: the track 
              record of Internet security does not bode well for the free and 
              easy commercial transfer of assembly codes for the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s-up 
              creation of products.</p>
<h4>Social</h4>
<p>During the Industrial Revolution in England, improved agricultural 
              efficiencies accelerated the process of enclosure, dislocating the 
              rural population no longer needed for raising and harvesting crops. 
              Simultaneous improvements in the production of iron and steel, in 
              weaving, and other areas began to transform cottage industries into 
              factory-based industries, and urbanization rapidly changed the face 
              of the country. The nature of trade shifted from one-off mercantile 
              ventures and royal charters to stable capital for long-term ventures. 
              Factory industries supplanted cottage industries, local artisans, 
              and craft guilds, but the concentration of work in brick-and-mortar 
              containers still left some out of work: the notorious &#8220;surplus 
              labor&#8221; that kept wages low. The expansion of the new manufacturing 
              base managed to absorb surplus labor for some time, until the advent 
              of widespread <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> in the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>A robust generation of personal nanofactories may very well bifurcate 
              commerce into those items that can be manufactured at home and those 
              which still must be purchased through the familiar retail supply 
              chains. While a certain amount of jobs will be created around the 
              transportation of raw materials for PNs, they will be paltry in 
              comparison to the jobs the devices displace in manufacture, transport, 
              and sales. <a class="thought" href="entries/globalization_entry.html">Globalization</a> has already imposed a certain amount of 
              social dislocation in the manufacturing sectors; a maturing nanotechnology 
              could very well trigger a long-term social dislocation not seen 
              since the English migration from the newly-enclosed farmlands to 
              the new factories of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>The need for human labor seems to be diminishing at an accelerated 
              rate inverse to <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>&#8217;s description<sup>5</sup> of the advance 
              of technology. The shift from human muscle to <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> muscle took 
              millennia; from animal to human-guided mechanical, centuries; from 
              human-guided to robotic, decades; and the emergence of computer-directed 
              manufacture seems measured in years if not months. Human <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, 
              however, still is anchored in a near-medieval <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> where social 
              worth is measured by the type and extent of work one engages in. 
              The pecking <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of work starts at the menial and dirty level, 
              maids and animal rendering and manual labor (the province of illegal 
              immigrants and paroled convicts) comparable to carrying the hod. 
              The next step up is the marginally cleaner and less taxing &#8220;service 
              economy&#8221; of McJobs, which jousts with the decline of blue-collar 
              union-affiliated manufacturing jobs for the next higher rung (salaries 
              and benefits alone give the advantage to unionized jobs, regardless 
              of the decades-long decline in union membership, though the recent 
              perturbations in the airline and automobile industries in particular, 
              and corporate pension plans generally, leave even that in doubt). 
              Above that are the traditional white-collar jobs, but the new aristocracy&#8212;sharply 
              defined by the accelerating concentration of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> in at least 
              American society&#8212;is comprised of those who &#8220;let their 
              money work for them,&#8221; the investing class, the owners of the 
              means of production.</p>
<p>Work is devalued in other ways: in the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic change of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> 
              in which employees are now called &#8220;associates,&#8221; with a 
              presumed stake in the corporate success that is not mirrored anywhere 
              in the reward system; in the stock market rewarding corporate <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s 
              that trim the workforce; and in the precipitous erosion of industry-sponsored 
              pensions. Human labor has been, or is in the process of being, effectively 
              decoupled from the part of the economy that is valued. The long-term 
              consequences of this are by no means clear, but the advent of a 
              personal &#8211;nanofactories will not necessarily create a widespread 
              leisure class.</p>
<p>Another of the volumes on my physical desktop is William Julius 
              Wilson&#8217;s <i>When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban 
              Poor</i>. It deals with the &#8220;left behind&#8221; problem of those 
              under a double burden of low social status and of being dependent 
              upon jobs in industries that have moved elsewhere (to Alabama, to 
              Mexico, or to China). While the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> to a nanotechnology shift 
              need not be exact, Wilson&#8217;s depictions and analyses offer a 
              powerful warning we may need to confront within a generation: what 
              are the social consequences when there are no alternative employment 
              outlets for surplus labor? American history of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
              century holds small hope that our social attitudes will change rapidly: 
              the unemployed, underemployed, and &#8220;idle&#8221; always have 
              been despised for not somehow rising above the crushing weight of 
              social and economic forces beyond their control. Revolution traditionally 
              has been pointless or counterproductive, and Cite Soliel endures 
              in its multiple forms around the globe despite the potential and 
              promises of globalization, the Green Revolution, and countless other 
              advances.</p>
<p>It is tempting to suggest that nano-communes, with internal self-sufficiency 
              that leaven the worst effects of industrial-era unemployment, will 
              free the human <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> for more cerebral endeavors. Futures are almost 
              never equally distributed when they arrive, and <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">Utopian</a> dreams of 
              that kind have a history of being measured in months rather than 
              decades or eras. It is difficult to envision the rise of a labor 
              movement comparable to those of nineteenth-century Britain and the 
              United States; it is almost easier to predict the widespread distribution 
              of limited-capacity PNs as a form of social welfare (and social 
              placation of the underclass).</p>
<p>Larger questions arise out of this potential for increased social 
              marginality. The income gap between rich and poor has been widening 
              for more than two decades. Globalization has transformed the American 
              economy, and the household economy has suffered as a result. The 
              degree to which nanotechnology, the Internet, and other technologies 
              accelerate or buffer the social decoupling of work and status is 
              still an undiscovered country. If the cumulative effect is acceleration, 
              we need to anticipate the range of human adaptations that will follow. 
              If one no longer is attached in any meaningful way to an economy 
              and the political ideology that supports it, how long can that authority 
              hold one&#8217;s allegiance? And what are the alternatives if the 
              allegiance cannot otherwise be reinforced?</p>
<h4>Authority</h4>
<p>Although it is a commonplace to think of religious worship as timeless, 
              it actually undergoes periodic major shifts, often triggered by 
              secular events. In the first century of the Common Era, the nature 
              of revelation itself was transformed from the direct presence of 
              a transcendent deity to the interpretation of a written Scripture. 
              For Jews, the destruction of the Holy of Holies in the Second Temple 
              ended the traditional direct contact of the High Priests. For Christians, 
              the sudden absence of their Messiah from the streets of Jerusalem 
              transformed the Judaic <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of messianic return into an entirely 
              new understanding the relationship between human beings and their 
              Creator. </p>
<p>The struggle for primacy between the Catholic Church and secular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s began soon after Christianity was adopted as the official 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> of the Roman Empire. It continued through the Investiture 
              Controversy of the Middle Ages, and was the decisive factor in the 
              success of the Reformation. However, the waning of the dominance 
              of religion was a process begun centuries earlier by resistance 
              (&#8220;heresy&#8221;) within the Church itself, beginning with the 
              Great Schism of the Eastern Orthodox traditions. The purification 
              movements that created monastic orders within the Church presaged 
              the later coming of the Reformation, which relocated purifying reform 
              outside the Church and ended the sole authority of Rome to arbitrate 
              Christian salvation. The secular challenges arising from the Enlightenment 
              remain at play in the contemporary questions of Church and State, 
              Science and Belief, and authority to define human relations. Increasing 
              secularity jousts with the rise of fundamentalism and of sects, 
              undermining traditional &#8220;mainstream&#8221; churches.</p>
<p>Whether the maturing of nanotechnology will impact the continuing 
              struggle of religious authority is unclear. The potential is there, 
              certainly, as the manipulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> at the molecular level 
              comes perilously close to &#8220;playing <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>,&#8221; especially where 
              it might affect what it means to be human. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a>, 
              genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and cybernetic enhancements pose imminent challenges 
              to the religious understandings of &#8220;human,&#8221; and nanotechnology 
              bids to play a major role within each of those technologies. Public 
              discourse in areas where the definitions of &#8220;life&#8221; are 
              most contended are fueled as much by symbolism and metaphor as by 
              science; misapprehensions and misunderstandings about nanotechnology 
              may well be fuel for new battlefronts in what has been dubbed &#8220;the 
              culture wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the Reformation, the monolithic authority of the Church 
              of Rome was transformed into a limited number of Protestant denominations. 
              The existence of each one allowed anyone to resist the Authority 
              of the Catholic Church, and beyond that, the authority of any other 
              church. (The earliest attempt to incorporate a denial of secular 
              authority, under the banner of &#8220;No Bishops, No Barons,&#8221; 
              was ruthlessly suppressed by secular forces, whose worldly enforcement 
              had more immediate clout than the afterlife of religion.) The transformation 
              of monolithic Authority into micro-authority created a market for 
              allegiances. The old concept of rules defined and enforced by a 
              monopolistic Church&amp;#8212enforced by excommunication, the denial 
              of sacraments, and the resulting condemnation to an infernal afterlife&#8212;gave 
              way to a free market of ideas and selection of, rather than submission 
              to, authority that continues to this day. Catholic priests who wish 
              to marry may find refuge in the Anglican communion. Protestant churches 
              may fracture over rules of control and worship, and denominations 
              may enter schism over ecclesiastical matters, as witness the current 
              strain in the Anglican communion over the issue of gay bishops and 
              clergy, and the social acceptance of homosexuality. Other issues 
              less anchored in scriptural interpretation, like finances, may also 
              trigger the sundering of ways for a congregation.</p>
<p>Using this as an analogy for secular considerations, it is an interesting 
              exercise in speculation to consider whether nanotechnology generally, 
              and desktop manufacturing in particular, will lead to nano-communes 
              that eventually decouple individuals from the larger economy and 
              the political system so closely tied to it. Such communities would 
              be the natural descendants of the self-sufficient medieval monastic 
              orders, the utopian communities of the mid-1800s, and the communes 
              of the 1960s and beyond. Unlike their predecessors, they could be 
              &#8220;off the grid&#8221; in important ways, but not necessarily 
              withdrawn from the larger society.</p>
<p>In other realms, there is some additional promise in the potential 
              for using nanotechnology as a recycling outlet. Molecular disassembly 
              as a precursor to molecular assembly may be a completely different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of technological difficulties, and raises a series of questions 
              about disposal of nonessential <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. The Newtonian-world vision 
              of a methane burnoff is impractical at the molecular level, and 
              the state of byproduct disposal is unclear at this point. If unwanted 
              matter can be converted to <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, and stored for use, nanotechnology 
              could change the nature of both recycling and of power. If each 
              household ran on a &#8220;green power&#8221; combination of solar 
              energy and molecular conversions, entire industries might be transformed. 
              It stretches the <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> to think that factories could 
              be powered with wind, solar, and nano power, so the traditional 
              power industries might not disappear, but important sectors might 
              achieve relative independence from them.</p>
<p>At the same time, the intellectual property forces would still 
              work to bind nano&#173;based anything to the existing corporate world. 
              If nano goes &#8220;into the wild,&#8221; via bootleg or Robin Hood 
              dissemination, it could weaken the corporate hold, inspire a widespread 
              law enforcement crackdown on piracy, or dissolve society into above-ground 
              and Morlock-like subcultures that coexist because they have little 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to compete. In any of these scenarios, nanotechnology by 
              itself is not an actor: it is a tool of other interests, and its 
              impacts are dampened or enhanced by the decisions of social engineering 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a>. But if the end result is the alienation of large masses 
              of citizens from the engines of the economy and the icons of government, 
              the costs and secondary developments will be far ranging.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology has its own limits. A host of major decisions in 
              the social realm will not be changed to any great degree by nanotechnology. 
              It will not protect the Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge (indeed, 
              if natural gas is the first and basic fuel for desktop manufacturing, 
              it may exacerbate the pressures on the ANWR), nor will it stop the 
              denuding of the Amazon rain forest. It will not eliminate prejudice, 
              nor resolve the multiple questions of authority and Authority that 
              attend the modern estate of humankind. We can predict safely that 
              when this particular future of mature nanotechnology arrives, it 
              will not be equally distributed, and may easily be a <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a> of social 
              dominance rather than the delivery vehicle of social equity. Even 
              the utopian visions of Gene Roddenberry included a period of troubled 
              dystopia, which Alvin Toffler captured in <i>Future Shock</i>: &#8220;the 
              premature arrival of the future... the imposition of a new culture 
              on an old one&#8221; that results in &#8220;human beings.... increasingly 
              disoriented, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ively incompetent to deal with their environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which leaves me almost where I began: What do I make of this nanotechnology 
              thing? I suspect it will be very much like its predecessors, a potentially 
              transformative technology that will be bound on the bed of Procrustes 
              of the older social and economic systems that midwifed it. Because 
              of that, it has considerable potential to be more Pandora&#8217;s 
              Box than <a class="thought" href="entries/holy_grail_entry.html">Holy Grail</a> in the early going. Assuming that its byproducts 
              do not poison the groundwater or become an airborne <a class="thought" href="entries/grey_goo_entry.html">grey goo</a>, it 
              will almost have to achieve an outlaw status (or its more egalitarian 
              potential championed by those who will be deemed outlaws) before 
              it reaches a socially transformative cusp. In the near term, whether 
              I buy it in a store or make it with my nanofactory, I will still 
              have to pay for toilet paper.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The recent sci-fi blockbuster "The Matrix" began with Keanu Reeves accessing a subculture where there was such a thing as "private property".  He was accessing the black market, and trading freely within it, for things of great value that were forbidden to him by a vast and unjust federal authority (an apt charicature of US federal enforcement agencies).
<br>
<br>
Right now, the FDA kills well over 100,000 Americans per year, as it has done for decades by denying them the unseen and unimagined benefits of new treatements, both discovered and undiscovered (discouraged by the threat of force).  The DEA and ATF kick down thousands of people's doors every year, and sometimes murder them (in one case burning a church building full of innocent people to death on national TV, over a warrant issued for nonpayment of a federal $200 tax on otherwise legally owned rifles). This is in spite of the fact that everything the victims of these government agencies are accused of doing is legal under the 4th amendment to our constitution --the highest law of the land-- (although  blithering idiot law-enforcement will tell you that the constitution doesn't mean what it says in plain English, and if you're also a blithering idiot conformist graduate of the mandatory government youth propaganda camps --like 98%+ of US voters-- you'll believe them).  The IRS was created by an illegal and immoral alteration of the US constitution which created a "direct tax" on labor --violating the basic idea of a free country, as well as Article 1, section 9 of the now unrecognized US Constitution.  Every other government agency violates individual rights in at least 2 ways, unless it is the police, court system, or military.
<br>
<br>
Justice is now licensed (via mandatory membership to a "BAR Association"), with judges (lawyers in black robes) having the power to strip even those who begged for a license (and paid for 4 years of law school) of their ability to defend the innocent.  On joining a BAR Association, lawyers make themselves complicit in the incumbent system, and agree to enforce that system's injustices.  This is why Lysander Spooner was opposed to the licensing of lawyers via a BAR Association.  Spooner was an advocate of jury nullification of law for the same reason (judges may now silence those who pursue jury nullification arguments in court, thus denying them their first and sixth amendments in the one place where they matter most).
<br>
<br>
Every where you look in every major article in every major newspaper, there are stories about how a majority of idiots has willingly elected idiots similar to themselves to positions of government power.  These idiots then use force against their fellow man to solve perceived "problems" that are all insignificant compared to the misapplication of government force.
<br>
<br>
As such, this is my view:  Ending unjust law enforcement crackdowns on innocent people will be a primary benefit of the singularity.  As will the corollary of such actions: holding government agents accountable for the violation of individual rights.
<br>
<br>
There is no problem with western civilization, as created in word by James Madison et. al. and expanded in detail by Ayn Rand et. al.  -except that it doesn't come close to existing anymore.  (And, in case you're thinking you're going to confuse the issue by comparing "utopian capitalism" with "utopian communism" and saying that neither can possibly exist  ---Bullshit!  The US came vastly closer to capitalism than did Soviet Russia and Pol Pot's Cambodia or does Castro's Cuba. All of the solvable political problems with the US are tied to areas where the majority of US voters have turned our backs on the idea of individual freedom.  Such is evident upon the understanding of simple logic and history, but I don't have the space here to teach a full course in either of those two areas.)
<br>
<br>
In short, there can be no problem with voluntary and consensual behaviors in a post-singularity society, because that society will either be a totalitarian slave-owning dictatorship (centralized power), or a libertarian society (decentralized power).  There can be no such thing as "illegal drugs" in a post-singularity society, unless power is centralized.
<br>
<br>
If post singularity powers are decentralized, who would permit themselves the abuse that is heaped on the current user of illegal drugs?  What about the current gun owner?  Who would refuse to defend themselves?
<br>
<br>
Not one scientist in a thousand seems to be politically involved with the defense of individual freedom via electoral politics.  Very few people on this board seem to understand what individual freedom is, much less desire it.  Ironically, without individual freedom, the chances for a constructive singularity are vastly diminished.
<br>
<br>
For instance, who is wrong in this scenario?: "Police are gathered outside of a house that is full of people who are dealing and using illegal drugs, and hosting a web server that sells pornography including some that is illegal (but involving only voluntary adult actors/actresses) with no intention of paying one single cent of their money.  The police knock the door down in an attempt to arrest the people inside the house, and the people inside the house all retaliate with robotic machinery that is connected to their nervous systems, and kill all of the police." (Perhaps like future true libertarian-republicans like Kevin Warwick might do when their right to stimulate their nervous systems with electrical pulses is more greatly challenged by the nanny state.)
<br>
<br>
Well, although the people inside the house were breaking laws, they were breaking unjust laws that had no right ever to exist in the first place.  Noone's rights were violated, and noone's property was destroyed until the police broke down the door.  In such a case, they would be 100% in the right to defend themselves with lethal force (just as are the main characters in the more detailed novels regarding the philosophy of self-defense: "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand, and "Unintended Consequences" by John Ross).
<br>
<br>
The one single lesson that "The Matrix" attempted to teach pre-singularity scientists such as Ray Kurzweil is that there is a world full of busybodies who think that it is OK to murder innocent people so long as they do it without taking responsibility for their actions, by a secret ballot.
<br>
<br>
In Anchorage Alaska, the city assembly is trying to violate the rights of 80 bar owners by banning smoking in bars, simply because they are a minority whose rights can seemingly be safely violated (all supposedly for the public good).  These 80 bar owners own smoking establishments (in relation to the 240 bars that disallow smoke).  They cater to a group of people who have voluntarily chosen a seemingly unhealthy personal lifestyle choice.  Should these bar owners be free to so cater, and thus free to generate personal wealth (which incidentally is vastly healthier than living in a fascist State with no property rights)?  Or should the state be able to take away our freedom to control our own lives?  Should the state be responsible for removing risk (and its possible reward) from our lives?
<br>
<br>
Should we be able to defend ourselves, or should the state control the means of self-defense?  What happens when one of those bar owners kills a cop who's attempting to write him a ticket that violates his property rights?  Does that mean that guns are unsafe and must also be banned "for the public good"?
<br>
<br>
Pre-singularity, in areas where private property (including private gun ownership) is allowed, MOST people are not subjects of an absolute tyranny.  Post singularity, the task of decentralizing power will be controlled by Drexler's "leading force".
<br>
<br>
If the US government developed a molecular assembler tomorrow, and did not decentralize its use they would proceed on a rampage of mass murder of their own citizens/subjects that would dwarf the 55 million innocent people murdered by Josef Stalin.  The "drug war" and the war on gun owners has proven beyond all doubt that the US government has nothing but contempt for individual freedom, and that they are willing to murder their own citizens in cold blood, without just cause, in the name of "the public good".  The same reason was given by Stalin for his murdering.
<br>
<br>
For statistics on mass murder by government during peacetime, please visit <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011120618/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills" target="_blank">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills</a> and note that the US drug war and the ATF war on gunowners are not well documented on the site, as of the last time I checked it.  For better nonfiction information on those subjects, please read the new book "The New Prohibition" anthology edited by Bill Masters, as well as researching the nonfiction portions of "Unintended Consequences" by John Ross.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps then, if you are nearing completion of a working molecular assembler, it will not be used to slaughter innocent people.
<br>
<br>
Since I don't like to bitch without offering my $.02 about a feasible solution, here it is: 
<br>
<br>
If you decide I'm correct in my fears, I strongly urge you to get involved with the 1) Alaska Libertarian Party, or failing the desire to move to Alaska or to contribute financially to such a remote state, the 2) Wyoming Libertarian Party, since those two states have pro-freedom political climates on the individual level, as well as having a mathematical chance of electing a libertarian.  In Alaska, any donation would largely be worthless until 2008 or later, since the 2006 election is already a foregone conclusion.  If you move to Alaska with the desire to run for office as an electable suit-wearing candidate who knows how to talk to people, please contact me about what district could best use your abilities.  Keep in mind that Alaska law prohibits you from running for office prior to having lived in your district for 2 years.  This means that you need to organize prior to moving here.
<br>
<br>
There isn't much time left for us to make Alaska a bright shining beacon of freedom, on the level that Hong Kong previously was.  (Upon HK's return to the Chinese, it became illegal to assemble in public without permission from the local police department. See: "Freedom's Fall in Hong Kong" by Alvin Rabushka)
<br>
<br>
Emails welcome.  Hate mails also welcome, because they waste the time of the composer, and give me a chuckle.  I will respond to all constructive emails.
