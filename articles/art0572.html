<h2>&#160;</h2>
<p>Telemarketing. Thirteen unlucky letters that can inflame the most 
              ill-tempered rage in otherwise well-behaved people. The modern bane 
              of dinnertime: "click . . . uhh . . . Hello . . . Mr. Gersdenfull, 
              how are you today?" Much worse than I was a few minutes ago. The 
              most private times and places are invaded by calls flogging goods 
              that have an unblemished record of being irrelevant, useless, or 
              suspicious. Answering these calls is a pointless interruption, listening 
              to the answering <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> pick them up is almost as bad, and shutting 
              off the phone eliminates the calls that I do care about.</p>
<p>Who's responsible for this unhappy state of affairs? I don't blame 
              the poor person at the other end of the line who is stuck trying 
              to make a living by being subjected to other people's ire. And I 
              don't really fault their bosses, who are doing what they are supposed 
              to do in a free market, taking advantage of a perceived <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
              opportunity. I blame the telephone, and Pope Leo X.</p>
<p>If modern <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> dates from Gutenberg's development 
              of movable metal type in the 1450s, then Martin Luther was the first 
              master of the new medium, and Leo X the first opponent of its personalization. 
              At the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in Europe the Church had a monopoly on divine <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, 
              which had to use its format of a Latin Bible, available only through 
              the word of priests who were its authorized trained representatives. 
              Popes Julius II and then Leo X took advantage of the monopoly to 
              fund an ambitious building <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for St. Peter's Cathedral by 
              selling indulgences. These handy letters offered the remission of 
              sins, and a shorter period in purgatory along the way to guaranteed 
              eternal salvation. Johann Tetzel, the monk whose territory for selling 
              indulgences included Luther's community, was particularly creative 
              in marketing them. On his convenient price list murder cost eight 
              ducats; witchcraft was a bargain at two ducats. He even offered 
              indulgences to help save family and friends who had already passed 
              away. Such a deal.</p>
<p>Luther's disgust at this venal corruption of the principles of 
              the Church drove him in 1517 to post a complaint on the local BBS 
              of the day, the door of the castle church in Wittenberg. His Ninety-five 
              Theses (Luther 95?) argued that salvation must come from personal 
              faith and deeds, not purchase of papal authority. His story might 
              have ended there, but for a difference in responding to the affordances 
              of a new medium. Luther recognized that the printing press enabled 
              one-to-many <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. Before movable metal type, hand-copied 
              books had been so expensive that only the <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y or the Church 
              had direct <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to them; by 1500 there were millions of printed 
              books in circulation. Within weeks of its original posting, Luther's 
              Theses had been copied and spread throughout Europe. Leo in turn 
              understood the threat that widespread printing posed to the authority 
              of the Church. He tried to restore central control by issuing a 
              papal bull to require certification from the Church before book 
              publication, and in 1521 excommunicated Luther, forbidding the printing, 
              selling, reading, or quoting of his writings. After Luther responded 
              by burning the bull of excommunication, Leo had him summoned for 
              judgment to the tastefully named Diet of Worms, where he was exiled.</p>
<p>Luther won. His brief exile gave him a chance to translate the 
              New Testament into German, and his excommunication gave his book 
              sales a great boost, bending the Church's propaganda apparatus into 
              creating PR for him. The Reformation sprang from Luther's Theses. 
              He and his fellow authors understood that they were writing for 
              the printing press and hence produced short tracts that were easily 
              duplicated&#8212;the first sound bites. The authors of the Counter-Reformation 
              didn't appreciate this change, writing hefty tomes in the old style 
              that were hard to distribute.</p>
<p>The Reformation message fell on the fertile soil of a laity fed 
              up with a clergy that forced divine interactions through their preferred 
              means, demanded meaningless ritual observances, and introduced self-serving 
              modifications into the liturgy. The availability of vernacular (non-Latin) 
              Bibles let ordinary people evaluate and then question the claim 
              of privileged papal authority. From here grew the modern <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> 
              of personal <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>s distinct from communal responsibility.</p>
<p>Fast-forward now a few centuries. I had just received a new laptop, 
              one of the most powerful models of its generation. I wanted to use 
              it to make a presentation, but for the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of me I couldn't find 
              any way to turn on the external video connection. Resorting to the 
              ignominy of reading the manual, I found this gem of technical writing 
              explaining how to get into the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s setup <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> 
              the video output:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">1. Make sure that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              is turned off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">2. Remove any diskette 
              from the diskette drive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">3. Turn on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">4.&#160;Watch closely the flashing 
              cursor in the top-left corner of the screen. When the cursor jumps 
              to the top-right corner of the screen, press and hold <b>Ctrl+Alt</b>, 
              then press <b>Insert</b>. <i>You must do this while the cursor is 
              at the top -right of the screen</i>. Release the keys.</font></p>
<p>Performing this feat requires three fingers and split-second timing. 
              Even the Roman Catholic Church couldn't top this for imposing nonsensical 
              rituals onto sane people. And, like the Church, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry 
              forces most people's interactions to go through one approved means 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>, keyboard, <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>), and it sells salvation through upgrades 
              that are better at generating revenue than delivering observable 
              benefits in this lifetime. The Reformation was a revolt, enabled 
              by the spread of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>, against the tyranny of 
              central authority. I'm increasingly concerned about the tyranny 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> itself. In many ways we're still fighting 
              the Reformation battle to establish <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to printing presses, 
              when we should be worrying about the <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> of the printing presses 
              to us.</p>
<p>Luther's Ninety-five Theses and Leo's response helped to inspire 
              the English Bill of Rights after King James II was deposed in 1688. 
              Among other sins, James had abused the ultimate line-item veto, 
              the royal Dispensing Power that let him make exceptions to laws, 
              to try to place Catholics throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>. 
              In 1689 his Protestant son-in-law and daughter, William of Orange 
              and Mary, were crowned King and Queen (thanks, Dad). Parliament 
              handled the sticky question of the authority to do this by presenting 
              William and Mary with what became the Bill of Rights. This established 
              the grounds upon which James was deemed to have forfeited his right 
              to rule, and then took the remarkable step of listing thirteen new 
              rights that the monarchy would have to accept, including <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> 
              of speech in the Parliament.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution in 1787 did not explicitly include a Bill 
              of Rights, a source of widespread dissatisfaction. People didn't 
              trust the Federalist argument that they had nothing to worry about 
              since the Constitution didn't give the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> authority over 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> rights. This was remedied by the first act of the first 
              Congress, passing the amendments that were ratified by the states 
              in 1791 to create the U.S. Bill of Rights, modeled on and in some 
              places copied from the English Bill of Rights. The First Amendment, 
              of course, extended the <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> of speech and the press to everyone.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of widespread <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the means of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              was echoed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a>s Act of 1934, the bill that established 
              the FCC to regulate the emerging radio and telephone services. It 
              states its purpose to be ". . . to make available, so far as possible, 
              to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, 
              and world-wide wire and radio <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> service with adequate 
              facilities at <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able charges. . ." The telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> was 
              to be managed privately as a common carrier that could not arbitrarily 
              deny service to anyone, and would be permitted to cross-subsidize 
              local phone service to keep it affordable. The result has been the 
              arrival of telephones in 94 percent of U.S. households.</p>
<p>Today the successors to the printing press remain as essential 
              as ever in helping distributed groups of people respond to the excesses 
              of central authority, whether by photocopied samizdat in Russia 
              or faxes to Tiananmen Square demonstrators. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> enables 
              a kind of political <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a> that is a very clear threat 
              to efforts to keep political <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming centralized. National attempts 
              to limit and regulate <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> are increasingly doomed, as 
              the means to send and receive bits gets simpler and the available 
              channels proliferate. Borders are just too permeable to bits. While 
              China was busy worrying about whether to allow official <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s were already being sent through a satellite link 
              that had been <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up for high-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s.</p>
<p>Now constellations of low-<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a> satellites are being launched 
              that will bring the convenience of a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-phone <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> everywhere 
              on the globe. Motorola's Iridium <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> comprises sixty-six such 
              satellites. (It was originally named after the seventy-seventh <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>, 
              iridium, because it was going to have seventy-seven satellites, 
              but when it was reduced to sixty-six satellites the name wasn't 
              changed because the sixty-sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> is dysprosium.) <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a>s, 
              and private companies, are launching spy satellites for <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
              applications. These satellites can almost read a license plate from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Soon, the only way to cut a country off from the rest of 
              the world will be to build a dome over it. The free exchange of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> makes abuses harder to cover up, and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of alternatives 
              harder to suppress.</p>
<p>We should now worry less about control of the means of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> 
              and more about control by the means of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. While we've 
              been diligently protecting each new medium from manipulation by 
              latter-day Leos, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s and computing have been merging 
              so that the medium can not only become the message, it can make 
              sure that you know it. </p>
<p>A ringing telephone once held the promise that someone was interested 
              enough in you in particular to look up your <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> and call you. 
              The phone <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s themselves were deemed to be public <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              but the telephone companies kept careful control over the <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s 
              used to produce the phone books. This was a stable arrangement until 
              the advent of cheap <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s and massive storage on inexpensive 
              compact disks. It was perfectly legal to ship a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> and a carton 
              of phone books off to a low-wage country, where the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              was laboriously typed in (a few times, actually, to catch mistakes) 
              and sent back on a CD. <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a> to your telephone had been constrained 
              by the difficulty of any one person using more than a few phone 
              books; now it became available to anyone with a CD drive.</p>
<p>Phone <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s were just the beginning. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you call an 800 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, or use a credit card, you deposit a few bits of personal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> somewhere. Where you called from, what 
              you bought, how much you spent. Any one of these records is harmless 
              enough, but taken together they paint a very personal picture of 
              you. This is what Lotus and Equifax did in 1990, when they announced 
              the Marketplace:Households product. By assembling legally available 
              consumer <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, they pieced together a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of 120 million 
              Americans, giving names, addresses, ages, marital status, spending 
              habits, estimated incomes. Interested in finding rich widows living 
              on isolated streets? How about chronic credit-card overspenders? 
              No problem. This shocking invasion of <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> was perfectly legal; 
              the only thing that prevented the <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> from being sold was the 
              tens of thousands of outraged e-mail complaints that Lotus received. 
              Lotus's blunder only helped to pave the way for the slightly less 
              indiscreet direct marketers that followed, cheerfully collecting 
              and selling your particulars. These are the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that turn a ringing 
              telephone from an invitation to personal <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> to an announcement 
              that you've been selected as a target demographic.</p>
<p>My wife and I spent a few years getting to know each other before 
              we moved in together, making sure that we were compatible. I wasn't 
              nearly so choosy about my telephone, although I certainly wouldn't 
              tolerate from a spouse many of the things it does. The phone summons 
              me when I'm in the shower and can't answer it, and when I'm asleep 
              and don't want to answer it; it preserves universal <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to me 
              for friend and telemarketing foe alike. Letting the phone off the 
              hook because it has no choice in whether to ring or not is akin 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> excuse that it's not responsible for its <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s 
              because it's only following orders. Bad people won't go away, but 
              bad telephones can. A telephone that can't make these distinctions 
              is not fit for polite company.</p>
<p>If a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is connected to the telephone it's probably used 
              for e-mail, and if it's used for e-mail there's probably too much 
              of it. I get about one hundred messages a day. A surprising amount 
              of that comes in the middle of the night, sent by a growing population 
              of nocturnal zombies who arise from their beds to answer their e-mail 
              before the next day's installment arrives. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              will need paper, and more paper, and more paper. In 1980 the United 
              States consumed 16 million tons of paper for printing and writing; 
              ten years later that jumped to 25 millions tons. So much for the 
              paperless <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. If you want to carry the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> around with 
              you it needs batteries; the United States is currently throwing 
              away 2 billion of them a year, the largest source of heavy metals 
              in landfills.</p>
<p>There's a very real <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which the things around us are infringing 
              a new kind of right that has not needed protection until now. We're 
              spending more and more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> responding to the demands of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              While relating religious oppression to poorly designed consumer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s might appear to trivialize the former and selfishly 
              complain about the latter, recognize that regimes that imposed these 
              kinds of practices on their subjects have generally been overthrown 
              at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>The first step in protecting rights is to articulate them. In keeping 
              with the deflation from Luther's Ninety-five Theses to the Bill 
              of Rights' ten amendments, I'd like to propose just three new ones:</p>
<p><u>BILL OF THINGS USERS' RIGHTS</u></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Have <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> available when you want it, where you want 
                it, and in the form that you want it</li>
<li>Be protected from sending or receiving <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that you 
                don't want</li>
<li>Use <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> without attending to its needs</li>
</ul>
<p>A shoe <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that can get <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> from walking instead of needing 
              batteries, that can communicate through a body instead of requiring 
              adapter cables, that can deliver a message to eyeglasses or a shirtsleeve 
              or an earring, that can <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> a cryptographic protocol to unobtrusively 
              authorize a purchase without providing any identifying <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              that can figure out when to speak and when not to, is not really 
              an unusually good idea; it's just that a laptop that cannot do these 
              things is an increasingly bad one.</p>
<p>By shifting more authority to people, the Reformation led to a 
              new morality, a new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of shared standards of rights and responsibilities 
              that helped define what it means to be civilized. The opportunities 
              and excesses associated with the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world now require that 
              this morality be updated from the sixteenth century to the twenty-first. 
              Oppressive <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are as bad as oppressive churches; <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> of 
              technological <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> is as <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant as <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> of religious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>.</p>
<p>As market forces drive down the cost of computing and communicating 
              so that it can become a discretionary purchase for most people, 
              like buying a TV, universal <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> is becoming less of a concern. 
              A new barrier enforcing social stratification is ease of <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>. 
              The members of my family have no trouble earning advanced degrees, 
              yet they struggle to connect a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, and manage 
              to find countless ways to lose files they are working on. They rely 
              on a complex social and technical support <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> to solve these 
              problems (me). If a Ph.D. is not sufficient qualification to use 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, how can we hope that putting <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in the hands 
              of more people can help them? Democratizing <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to solutions, 
              rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, is going to require as much concern for 
              the usability as the availability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Our legal <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is already straining to cope with the unexpected 
              implications of connecting smart distributed <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Establishing 
              technological rights cannot happen by central command; it must happen 
              by changing the expectations of both the designers and users of 
              the new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Here, too, the first step is to articulate the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> requirements needed to meet our demands. With the current 
              division of labor, neither people nor things can do what they do 
              best. Accordingly, I would also like to propose three rights for 
              things.</p>
<p><u>BILL OF THINGS' RIGHTS</u></p>
<p>Things have the right to:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Have an <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a></li>
<li><a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a> other <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s</li>
<li>Detect the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of their environment</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>My office has ten things that include a clock, and each one reports 
              a different <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> with equal confidence. I perform a high-tech equivalent 
              of marking the solstices by the ritual of navigating through ten 
              sets of menus to update the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. My annoyance at having to do this 
              is pointless if these competing clocks are not given the resources 
              needed to do what I expect of them, which is to tell me the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. 
              That requires they know something about timekeeping, including determining 
              where they are to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> zone, communicating with a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> standard 
              to get the correct <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and even recognizing that most of them 
              are redundant and don't all need to report the same <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these rights define a new notion of behavior, shared 
              between people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, that is appropriate for a new era. 
              Along with these rights come new responsibilities; what was suitable 
              in the sixteenth century is not now. E-mail is a good example of 
              how social norms suitable for the physical world can outlive their 
              usefulness in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world.</p>
<p>My mother taught me to speak when spoken to. This <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able instruction 
              means that each day I should send out one hundred e-mail messages 
              in response to the hundred or so that I receive from other people. 
              Of these, about 10 percent need further <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> that requires initiating 
              a new message to someone else. At the beginning of the day I had 
              one hundred messages coming in; at the end I have 110 going out. 
              If, then, each of my recipients is equally well-behaved, the next 
              day there will be 121 circulating because of me. If each recipient 
              remains as courteous, in a week my day's investment in correspondence 
              will have paid a dividend of 214 messages. This exponential explosion 
              will continue unabated until either people or <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s break down. 
              Of course some messages naturally don't need a response, but every 
              day in which you send out more e-mail than you receive, you're responsible 
              for contributing to e-mail <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>.</p>
<p>The problem stems from an asymmetry between the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it takes to 
              create and read a message. While most people don't write any faster 
              than they used to, it takes just moments to paste big stretches 
              of other texts into a message, or forward messages on to others, 
              or add many people as recipients to one message. What's not immediately 
              apparent is the cost in other people's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. If I take a minute 
              to skim each message I get and then a minute to dash off a hasty 
              response, I've used up half a working day.</p>
<p>Given this mismatch, the most considerate thing to do is answer 
              e-mail only if it can't be avoided, and to do so as briefly as possible. 
              When I arrived in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab I used to write carefully crafted 
              e-mail messages that addressed all sides of an issue, patiently, 
              at length, taking as much <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> as needed to make sure that I said 
              everything just right, not missing anything that warranted comment, 
              or explanation, or observation. My peers' terse or absent responses 
              left me wondering about their manners, if not their literacy, until 
              each hour I was adding per day to do e-mail left me wondering about 
              my sanity. In an era of overcommunication, saying less is more. 
              This is entirely unlike what is appropriate for handwritten correspondence, 
              where the effort to send a message exceeds the effort to receive 
              one.</p>
<p>The spread of computing is making it ever easier to communicate 
              anywhere, anytime; the challenge now is to make it easier to not 
              communicate. We've come too far in connecting the world to be able 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> everything off; we must go further in turning everything 
              on. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s must become smart enough to help us manage as well 
              as move <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>One of the inspirations for the prevailing <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>-and-mice user 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> was <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a>'s studies of child development. <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> 
              and mice represent a stage when infants begin to gesture to identify 
              things in their environment. This was never meant to last as long 
              as it has; like infants, <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s should also grow up. Around 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that infants start pointing they also start talking. They 
              practice <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> by incessant chatter, saying things over and over 
              again for the pleasure of hearing themselves speak, but not yet 
              understanding the repercussions of their <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. That's what so 
              much <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> is, growing pains as our social expectations 
              catch up to the technological means with which we live.</p>
<p>Amid this din, a quiet voice <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>ically cuts through with perhaps 
              the best insight of all into <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> in an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Age. 
              The original <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>, Luther, somewhat grudgingly published 
              a complete edition of his Latin works in 1545 to correct the errors 
              that had accumulated in earlier copies. In the preface, he explains 
              his hesitation to release one more contribution to his <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>'s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> overload: "I wanted all my books to be buried in perpetual 
              oblivion, that thus there might be room for better books."</p>
