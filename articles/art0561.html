<div class="TeaserText">The world has been whipped up into hysteria over terrorist attacks and "weapons of mass destruction."
Governments want to ban the publication of sensitive scientific research results, and a group of major life sciences editors and authors has concurred. Some even suggest an international body to police research and publication. Dr. Mae-Wan Ho looks at the current SARS epidemic and argues why all of those measures to control bioterrorism are misplaced, and what's really needed.</div>

              of Science in Society</a> April 16, 2003. Published on KurzweilAI.net 
              April 17, 2003.</i></p>
<h2>The SARS episode </h2>
<p>In the weeks that the "allied forces" were wreaking destruction 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in Iraq to hunt down Saddam Hussein and his elusive "weapons 
              of mass destruction," a SARS epidemic has been crisscrossing 
              continents carried by air-passengers and spreading like molecular 
              cluster bombs that explode to liberate further millions of infectious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s soon after a target is struck. </p>
<p>SARS&#8212;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#8212;is a completely 
              new infectious <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> spread by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> contact, and kills about 
              four percent of the victims. The epidemic originated in Guangdong 
              Province, South China. The Chinese authority has admitted mishandling 
              the crisis and to have been slow to inform its citizens. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> first struck last November. In March, Liu Jianlin, 
              64-year-old medical professor who was involved in treating patients, 
              went from Guangdong to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. He was taken 
              ill soon after arrival and admitted to hospital. He asked to be 
              put into quarantine, but was ignored; nor did the hospital warn 
              his contacts. As a result, nine guests in the hotel where he stayed 
              caught the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and carried it to Singapore, Canada, Vietnam 
              and other hospitals in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On 10 February, news of the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> was posted on ProMed, an international 
              e-mail notification service for infectious <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s outbreaks. The 
              next day, China informed the World Health Organisation (WHO), but 
              refused to let the WHO team into Guangdong until early April. By 
              8 April, there were 2671 confirmed cases of SARS in 19 countries 
              and 103 deaths. </p>
<p>A palpable <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of panic has gripped the health authorities around 
              the world. "Mother <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> is the ultimate terrorist," 
              says an editorial in the journal <i><a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a></i>. "Powerless 
              to stop the spread," says <i>New Scientist </i>magazine, whose 
              editor decries the lack of international control when it comes to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> epidemics: "The international community has <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s 
              inspectors poised to force entry into a country at the first hint 
              that it may possess chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s. But when it comes to <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, 
              we have no international body empowered to take charge, <i>even 
              though the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> may be vastly more dangerous</i>." </p>
<p>Eleven laboratories around the world participated in the hunt for 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a>, a collaborative effort organised via teleconferencing, 
              since March 17, by virologist Klaus St&#246;hr at the WHO headquarters 
              in Geneva. </p>
<p>The journal <i><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> says that Malik Pieris of the University 
              of Hong Kong was the first to identify coronavirus (which causes 
              colds and pneumonia) just four days later. This finding was replicated 
              in other laboratories. The <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> and antibodies against the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> 
              were detected in many, though not all infected patients, but were 
              not found in more than 800 healthy controls tested. </p>
<p>The <i>New Scientist</i> says it was the <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of Carlo Urbani, 
              the WHO doctor who first recognized SARS as a new <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> that led 
              to the discovery of coronavirus. It was isolated from his lungs 
              and sent to Joe DiRisi in University of California at San Francisco, 
              who made the identification. The <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> has since been named after 
              Urbani.</p>
<p>There is some remaining doubt, however, whether the coronavirus 
              is the complete story. John Tam, director of virology at Prince 
              of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, found another <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> metapneumovirus, 
              in 25 out of 53 SARS patients, as have laboratories in Canada and 
              Germany. Metapneumoviru belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, which 
              includes viruses responsible for parainfluenza, mumps and measles, 
              as well as the Nipah and Hendra viruses in recent outbreaks.</p>
<p>Coronavirus showed up in only 30 patients tested while the bacterium 
              <i>Chlamydia </i>has been identified in all samples in Hong Kong, 
              though that strain of <i>Chlamydia</i> is not known to cause <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Could it be that both viruses are bystanders of the <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> while 
              an as yet unidentified <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> could be responsible for SARS? </p>
<p>The coronavirus was atypical. It rapidly infected cells in culture 
              dishes, something that other <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> coronaviruses do not do. Viruses 
              from the lung tissue in Toronto patients readily infected monkey 
              kidney cells, and no known <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> coronavirus infects that <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> line.</p>
<p>DiRisi's laboratory has a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> detector <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> capable of screening 
              for 1200 viruses all at once. When samples sent from the Centers 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a> Control and Prevention in the United States (CDC) were 
              screened, several <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of coronaviruses lit up; the strongest 
              spots&#8212;indicating the closest <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>&#8212;were the avian bronchities 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> and a bovine coronavirus. This appears to fit China's statement 
              that the earliest cases were in bird handlers.</p>
<p>However, more detailed analysis using polymerase chain reaction 
              (PCR) by two groups who just published their results online in the 
              <i>New England Journal of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a></i>, indicates that the new <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> 
              is not closely related to <i>any</i> known <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> at all, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>, bovine, <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>, pig, bird, notwithstanding. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> was isolated from <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> cultures only, and 
              not from the tissues of patients. The PCR fragments of the new coronavirus 
              were not detected in any healthy subject tested so far. But not 
              all patients with SARS tested positive for one of the PCR fragments. 
              Where did this new <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> come from?</p>
<h2>Genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering super-viruses </h2>
<p>While the epidemic has still to run its course, a report appeared 
              in the <i>Journal of Virology</i>, describing a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> for introducing 
              desired mutations into coronavirus in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to create new viruses. 
              A key feature of the procedure is to make interspecific chimera 
              recombinant viruses. It involves replacing part of the spike <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> 
              gene in the feline infectious peritonitis <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> (FIPV)&#8212;which 
              causes invariably fatal infections in cats&#8212;with that of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> hepatitis <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. The recombinant mFIPV will no longer infect 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> cells, but will infect <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> cells instead, and multiply rapidly 
              in them. </p>
<p>These and other <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in manipulating viral <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s are now 
              routine. It shows how easy it is to create new viruses that jump 
              host <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in the laboratory, in the course of apparently legitimate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Similar <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s could be 
              happening in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> when no one is looking, as the SARS and many 
              other epidemics amply demonstrate. </p>
<p>It is not even necessary to intentionally create lethal viruses, 
              if one so wishes. It is actually much faster and much more effective 
              to let random recombination and mutation take place in the test 
              tube. Using a technique called "molecular breeding" (see 
              "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011074358/http://www.i-sis.org.uk/deathByDNAShuffling.php" target="_blank">Death 
              by DNA shuffling</a>," this series), millions of recombinants 
              can be generated in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of minutes. These can be screened for 
              improved function in the case of enzymes, or increased virulence, 
              in the case of viruses and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. </p>
<p><b><i>In other words, geneticists can now greatly speed up <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              in the laboratory to create viruses and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> that have never 
              existed in all the billions of years of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a></i>.</b></p>
<h2>Controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/bioterrorism_entry.html">bioterrorism</a> </h2>
<p>John Steinbruner, University of Maryland arms control expert, has 
              been calling for mandatory international oversight of inherently 
              dangerous areas of biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, specifically, an international 
              body of scientists and public representatives to authorize such 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>.</p>
<p>He has taken the proposal to meetings of the American Association 
              for the Advancement of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and the World Medical Association 
              in recent months, and in April 2003, to a London <a class="thought" href="entries/bioterrorism_entry.html">bioterrorism</a> meeting, 
              sponsored by the Royal <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> and the New York Academy 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a>. </p>
<p>The oversight <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> would be mandatory and would operate before 
              potentially dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s are conducted. <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a> to results 
              could also be limited to those who pass muster.</p>
<p>Requiring scientists, institutions and even <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s to be licensed 
              "would have a devastating chilling impact on biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>," 
              said American <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> for Microbiology (ASM) president Ronald M. 
              Atlas. His answer is self-regulation, already in line with ethical 
              requirements to prevent the destructive uses of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. </p>
<p>The ASM orchestrated and supports a statement released February 
              15 by a group of major <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s editors and authors, acknowledging 
              the need to block publication of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> results that could help 
              terrorists. </p>
<p>Critics say even the self-censorship espoused by the journal editors 
              and authors group is an impediment to the rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, 
              which is the best way to defuse the lethal potential of some <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. But Steinbruner fears that self-regulation does not go 
              far enough to head off terrorists. </p>
<p>Both Steinbruner and Atlas agree, however, that any effort to keep 
              good <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> out of the hands of ill-intentioned people must be 
              international to be effective. And both point to existing efforts 
              to push a treaty making <a class="thought" href="entries/bioterrorism_entry.html">bioterrorism</a> an international crime, one 
              long espoused by Harvard University microbiologist Mathew Meselson 
              and chemist Julian <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> of the University of Sussex. </p>
<p>Steinbruner and his critics, and the critics of his critics are 
              all missing an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant point. They have yet to acknowledge that 
              genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s are inherently dangerous, as first 
              pointed out by the pioneers of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering themselves in 
              the Asilomar Declaration in the mid 1970s, and as we have been reminding 
              the public and policy-makers more recently.</p>
<h2>Who needs bioterrorists when we've got genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers? </h2>
<p>But what caught the attention of the mainstream <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> was the report 
              in January 2001 of how <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers in Australia "accidentally" 
              created a deadly <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> that killed all its victims in the course 
              of manipulating a harmless <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. "Disaster in the making: 
              An <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> leaves us one step away from the ultimate 
              bioweapon," was the headline in the <i>New Scientist</i> article. 
              The editorial showed even less restraint: "The genie is out, 
              biotech has just sprung a nasty surprise. Next <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it could be 
              catastrophic." </p>
<p>The SARS episode should serve as a reminder of some simple facts 
              about genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering.</p>
<p>In the first place, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering involves the rampant recombination

              have very little opportunity to mix and recombine in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. And, 
              as said earlier, some newer techniques will create in the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>

              never existed in billions of years of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. </p>
<p>In the second place, <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>-causing viruses and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> and their 
              genetic material are the predominant materials and tools of genetic

            </p>
<p>And finally, the artificial constructs created by genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              are designed to cross <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> barriers and to jump into <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s, 
              i.e., to further enhance and speed up horizontal gene transfer and 
              recombination, now acknowledged to be <i>the</i> major route to 
              creating new <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> agents, possibly much more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant than point 
              mutations which change isolated bases in the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. </p>
<p>With genetic-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered constructs and <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s routinely released 
              into the environment, we hardly need the help of terrorists. That 
              may be why we are coming up against new epidemics of viral and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s with increasing regularity. Mother <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> is not the ultimate 
              terrorist, we are.</p>
<h2>What needs to be done instead? </h2>
<p>It is pointless to control the publication of sensitive scientific 
              results because there is nothing special about the recombination 
              techniques; they are already well known. "The only way we'll 
              ever understand these natural outbreaks is by first-rate <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              and getting it published," says Lynn Enquist, editor of the 
              <i>Journal of Virology</i>, referring to the creation of a coronavirus 
              that crosses from <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> that's a routine part of a genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering technique. </p>
<p>Open publication is only half of the story. The other half is the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of biosafety. An international <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> for regulating 
              biosafety already exists, it is the Cartegena Biosafety Protocol 
              agreed to in January 2000, now signed by 43 countries including 
              the European Union; though efforts to undermine it has continued 
              unabated, principally by the United States and allies and the biotech 
              industry. All we need to do is to strengthen the Biosafety Protocol 
              both in scope and in substance. </p>
<p>There is also an urgent need for democratic input into the broad 
              areas of scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> that are to be supported by the public 
              purse. Every sector of civil <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> has been called upon to be 
              "accountable," even corporations; so why not scientists? 
            </p>
<p>We have drafted a discussion document, <i>Towards a Convention 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a></i>, which contains some key ideas on how scientists 
              could be socially responsible and accountable.</p>

<b>Exponential growth in mapping disease genomes </b>
<p>In 1990, the sequencing of the smallpox virus <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011074358/http://www.si.edu/archives/ihd/videocatalog/9564.htm" target="_blank">took

              before Congress</a> on April 7, 2003, Dr. Julie Gerberding, director 
              of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the 
              CDC, WHO and nine other sites worldwide were sharing data in real 
              time via a secure Web server and had set up a global satellite video 
              conference with thousands of clinicians to recognize the disease 
              and establish means of treatment. They also created a Web site for 
              clinicians with example chest x-rays, symptoms, quarantine measures, 
              treatments, etc. </p>
<p>Within two weeks of identifying SARS (not the coronavirus), they 
              were able to come up with three separate tests to identify the disease 
              and they <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011074358/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/04/14/sars.sequence/" target="_blank">completed

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The problem is that Biotechnology, while quickly gaining the power to cure, is also gaining the power to kill. 
<br>
<br>
Bill Joy noticed this, but the Biologists said little (they do not want to bite the hand that feeds them), and the rest of the people (most of whom are NOT Molecular Biologists) said he was crazy.....
<br>
<br>
So the Problem is that biotechnology can be a deadly double edged sword. Not in some far off distant future. Dr. George Poste, a highly regarded scientist who sits on some Presidential commitees, wrote a paper over a year ago predicting there would be perhaps a 5 year window before bioterrorism would begin on a larger basis. We have about 3-4 years to go. I think that is on target. 
<br>
<br>
SARS might be a good practice run for the next plague, whether natural or man made. Perhaps the best (or worst) bioterror virus would be indistinguishable from a natural one....
<br>
<br>
So what to do to prevent this? How to stop it? Well, the vocal Libertarians who advocate that there is little need for oversight, I think should take some classes in Molecular biology, THEN they will have some credibility with me. I actually like much Libertarian ideals, but it often breaks down in areas like Public Health and (Bio)Defense. 
<br>
<br>
I believe that some of the buzzwords to help mitigate negative futures include: Prevention, Containment, Oversight, Surveillance and Transparency. 
<br>
<br>
Letting a million Molecular Biologists do whatever they want sounds good on paper, yet there needs to be some levels of control. But the Genie is out of the Bottle - stopping research would probably be impossible, so that is no solution. China has shown what a failure a lack of Transparency is. 
<br>
<br>
A real solution might look like this: An International oversight body that keeps an eye on laboratories via Transparency. Surveillance via Zebra biosensors on as many corners and nodes as possible to detect abnormal pathogens. Perhaps a science Internet that only accredited scientists can access. Access for lay people to advanced science on the Internet may need to be reassed. When threats are found, conatainment must be a rapid priority so as to prevent spread and infection. 
<br>
<br>
I hear many in the media and elsewhere talk about Vaccines as the magic bullet. Biotech people themselves like to talk about it - it keeps funding coming. Yet vaccines are very complicated, even for simple pathogens. There is no treatment yet for HIV, despite an enormous effort. What stops HIV? Prevention &amp; Containment, not vaccines. Condoms cost cents, antiviral drugs cost Thousands.
<br>
<br>
And even if vaccines could be made, Directed Evolution techniques could build a pathogen capable of fighting even that vaccine.
<br>
<br>
Yet today, these viable strategies and tactics I mention are still the Minority view. The current buzzwords are Open Markets, Globalism, BioCentury, anonymity etc. 
<br>
<br>
To close our eyes to the threat is irrational. To argue that it is not a threat is also irrational. To try to pretend that we do not need to modify our lives makes no sense. David Brin in the Transparent Society envisioned a world that might be able to mitigate these threats. To accept that there is a real threat, and to modify our actions would be the most sensible approach. These new buzzwords can creat entire new business opportunities, in fact, I belive the only way to survive against these pathogens is through the powerful service of Business. Look how much was accomplished during the Internet boom ( sure alot of hype, but progress did happen quickly). 
<br>
<br>
If we do embark on making these solutions, we need to do them justly and fairly though - surveillance and transparency against bioterrorism should NOT be used to control societies in a granular and moral way. Protections must be granted people in exchange for giving up some right.
<br>
<br>
SARS may be a trigger for the world to take these threats seriously, and move proactivley forward in a positive way, rather than a reactionary way.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Excellent point(s). As a resident of Toronto, I got to feel first hand the effects SARS had on people (actually it was significantly less than what the media would have you believe). The one thing that surprised me is the fact that despite the media hype surrounding this disease, the personal apathy of the average Torontonian towards it was staggering. I'm not saying that we should have panicked and all stayed indoors all the time, or worn respirators whenever we were out in public. What I'm saying is that I was floored to find the number of people violating their quarantines.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I felt through most of the time that the attention it was receiving in the media was overblown, however there was no doubt in my mind that had I been put under quarantine, I would have obeyed it. People need to realize that quarantines are there for a reason, when you compare 10 days of inconvenience to yourself with the lives of other people, there really should be no contest
<br>
<br>
As it stands now, it looks like Toronto has managed to get through the SARS "epidemic" fairly well all considered, there were a few unfortunate cases, and there was certainly significant economic damage, but in all it was not nearly as bad as it could have been.
<br>
<br>
We got off fairly lucky, but it could have been worse, and the next time it might be whether it's an artificial or natural virus, we definitely need to develop better methods for controlling a disease once the public has been exposed. I can only hope that the suffering caused by those afflicted with SARS can be offset somewhat by the knowledge that they had some part in starting a development which may save others from going through the same thing.</p></td>
