<h2>1. OVERVIEW </h2>
<p>The most immediate danger facing <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> is probably that 
              posed by <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s and emergent <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. The Lifeboat Foundation 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://lifeboat.com/ex/bioshield" target="_blank">BioShield</a> 
              proposal [<a href="#f1">1</a>], described by Lemelson-MIT Prize 
              winner <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> and US Senate majority leader Bill Frist, is 
              our recommended response to this danger. The BioShield proposal 
              emphasizes the development of technologies to combat bioweapons, 
              such as biological viruses, by developing broad tools to prevent 
              their development and to destroy them.<br>
<br>
              However, tomorrow's biggest danger is nanoweapons, and we believe 
              it is now <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to develop a solution to this problem. As Ray Kurzweil 
              said, "As the threshold for self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              approaches, we will then need to invest specifically in the development 
              of defensive technologies in that area, including the creation of 
              a technological <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>."</p>
<p>There are two types of nanoweapons: </p>
<p>1) Self-replicating weapons (ecophages) that make copies of themselves; 
              their only means of attack may be to "eat" the enemy or 
              his resources as they self-replicate.</p>
<p>2) Nonreplicating nanoweapons, similar to the tools of war today, 
              that are manufactured in a factory and then used in battle.</p>
<p> The NanoShield proposal has been designed primarily to handle 
              self-replicating weapons, but it will also be an excellent first 
              line of defense against nonreplicating weapons. Nonreplicating weapons 
              are more difficult to defend against, since they don't need to spend 
              a lot of time and effort in replicating. They are also easier to 
              design, since they do not have to include instructions on how to 
              replicate.</p>
<h2> 2. BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>One of the earliest-recognized and best-known dangers of molecular 
              nanotechnology is the risk that artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> replicators 
              [<a href="#f2">2</a>]&#8212;capable of digesting biological materials 
              and functioning autonomously in the natural environment&#8212;could 
              quickly convert the entire global ecosystem into more copies of 
              themselves. </p>
<p>This is a scenario often referred to as "grey goo," but 
              more accurately termed "global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a>," a term coined 
              by Robert A. Freitas, Jr. [<a href="#f3">3</a>]. Such replicators, 
              called "ecophages," would constitute a class of sophisticated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms more lethal than any plague that has ever 
              existed on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. If they are ever built and released, ecophages 
              will need to be controlled by a sophisticated artificial immune 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> more powerful than any immune system that has ever been existed 
              in natural <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>.<br>
<br>
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> immune system does not have to recognize dangerous invaders 
              the way a nanotech system would. Our immune system merely has to 
              recognize non-invaders and attack everything else. Another <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              distinction is that biological immune cells&#8212;and the invaders 
              that they must combat&#8212;will both replicate at biological speeds 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> levels. </p>
<p>In contrast, a contest of exponentially growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of nanotech 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s would cook the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere" target="_blank">biosphere</a> 
              in waste heat [<a href="#f3">3</a>], especially if a large number 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> replicating nanodevices were released simultaneously, and 
              if a different type of defensive device were needed to stop each 
              of them. </p>
<p>The human immune system also benefits from co-<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> with its 
              assailants. Microbes are selected to not overwhelm it too quickly, 
              otherwise plagues would burn out and the microbes would also lose. 
              The greatest immunological advantage of a human immune system may 
              be the vast number of humans in which it is found. When microbes 
              overwhelm it in one human, that human's selfish genetic material 
              can afford to simply die, while living on in other humans. But we 
              have only one earth, so we cannot afford such sacrifices of a global 
              scale. <br>
<br>
              For these <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, we have a more difficult task than that facing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> if we are to defend ourselves against artificial replicators. 
              But we also have advantages not possessed by nature. Most important 
              among these are the power to use design, to thoroughly analyze nanomachines 
              we find, and to employ macroscale phenomena in our defense.<br>
</p>
<h2>3. THE NANOSHIELD PROPOSAL</h2>
<p>Our proposal for a NanoShield encompasses five specific recommendations, 
              as follows.<br>
</p>
<h3>3.1 THREAT DETECTION</h3>
<p>To begin <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about this problem, it is first necessary to 
              determine the incidence of ecophagy that is likely to be detectable. 
              This will be primarily a function of the pervasiveness of our defenses, 
              and of the efficiency with which they can identify ecophagy, bearing 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that ecophages may be intentionally designed to resist identification. 
            </p>
<p>If nanorobots were withdrawing primarily <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> from the environment 
              to build diamond, you could in principle <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for the surplus 
              or "waste" atoms that they discharge. For example, if 
              an ecophage was consuming CHON-based organic material, and removing 
              mainly the <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> atoms for incorporation into its mostly hydrocarbon-based 
              replicas, it would presumably be discharging the unused H, O, and 
              N atoms into the local environment as waste products in some form.<br>
<br>
              But trying to detect ecophages by searching for the waste atoms 
              offers several challenges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> If they discharge as they feed, the discharge could be hidden 
                by designing the ecophage to release mostly "natural" 
                appearing effluents. For example, waste O, N and H atoms could 
                be released as atmosphere-like O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, 
                or H<sub>2</sub>O.<br>
<br>
                Unless there were a lot of ecophages concentrated in a small area, 
                the volume of such effluent discharges would be relatively small, 
                and any wind could rapidly disperse the effluents, even if they 
                could somehow be recognized as artificial.<br>
<br>
                Ecophages could package their wastes into compressed-gas or solid-<a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> 
                pellets and then drop them into the dirt. If they were covered 
                with a camouflage coating, these droppings would be undetectable.<br>
<br>
                Some ecophages might be made of non-hydrocarbon ceramics such 
                as boron nitride or <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> nitride, and thus would have a different 
                effluent signature than expected for diamondoid ecophages. Such 
                devices might not even need to consume biology during their relatively 
                slow Build (replicating) phase, but could consume rocks, etc. 
                instead, and then only consume biology during their relatively 
                fast Destroy (nonreplicating) phase [<a href="#f3">3</a>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the ecophage made a good effort to camouflage its effluents 
              they probably could not be detected, so a different detection <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> 
              would need to be tried to find the ecophage. </p>
<p>Two possible techniques are spectrographic analysis and sonographic 
              detection. One could detect MM products <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscope" target="_blank">spectroscopically</a>, 
              based on the presence of particular types of chemical bonds. However, 
              this could be defeated by ecophage designers by coating them with 
              something that looks natural, like silica (sand) or an outer shell 
              of some magnesium-iron-silicate-etc. mineral that looks exactly 
              like ordinary dirt. <br>
<br>
              MM products could be detected <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscope" target="_blank">sonographically</a> 
              based on their <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> in the environment as multiple clusters 
              of matter that resonate at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of frequencies. However, 
              this would have the problem that nanorobots and their parts have 
              very high resonant frequencies&#8212;gigaHertz or teraHertz&#8212;because 
              they are so small. Also, acoustic waves of these frequencies are 
              hugely attenuated in their passage through air, or even water, so 
              their useful range would be very short, on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of microns. 
              And it would not be wise to assume that ecophages will cluster into 
              nice large macroscale "tuning forks" that would make them 
              easier to detect&#8212;an ecophage designer would probably not require 
              his ecophages to do any aggregation at all in order to replicate.<br>
<br>
              Another method is to examine chunks of material. If we assume a 
              possible size on the order of 10 cubic microns, detection of a potentially 
              dangerous nanodevice in a cubic meter of material would require 
              that 10<sup>17</sup> chunks of that material be examined. To perform 
              such an examination for each of the 10<sup>15</sup> cubic meters 
              within two meters of the earth's surface, using rod <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> (nanomechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> at the molecular level, as proposed by <a class="thought" href="entries/drexler_entry.html">K. Eric Drexler</a> 
              in <i>Nanosystems</i>), would require roughly the Earth's incident 
              solar energy over a 15 minute period for every computational <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> 
              involved in characterizing a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> as a threat.</p>
<p>It would also require the impractical disassembly of every <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> 
              on Earth and some technique for utilizing the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> acquired. 
              Because some defensive probes would be expected to fail in the ordinary 
              course of events, this technique would also fail to detect ecophagy 
              armed to defend themselves. Even a less thorough examination, testing 
              a random sample consisting of one in 10<sup>12</sup> regions of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, would be disruptive, intensive, and relatively easy to circumvent.<br>
</p>
<p>Another method is to use three-dimensional images of nanoparticles 
              that have been obtained with a microscope using newly developed 
              coherent X-ray diffraction instead of focusing them [<a href="#f12">12</a>]. 
              This would allow for non-destructive forensic analysis to see if 
              it is an MM product. </p>
<p>Trying to detect MM products tactilely, based on hardness, could 
              be frustrated by camouflage coatings and would require physical 
              contact, which generates a large-numbers problem.<br>
<br>
              So rather than computationally analyzing and characterizing random 
              chunks of matter to determine whether they are capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, 
              a better solution is to continuously monitor the heat signature 
              of the entire global surface and possibly the subsurface [<a href="#f3">3</a>]. 
              If this is combined with sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, developing 
              trouble will be detected reasonably quickly. Manual inspection nanorobots 
              would then be sent to only those regions identified by the thermal 
              pattern recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> as scoring high on the "possible 
              trouble" index. The atmosphere and oceans will need to be monitored 
              as well. </p>
<p>Is it possible for an ecophage to mask its infrared signature and 
              thus elude detection? Mechanical and chemical activities develop 
              waste heat, so eventually this heat must appear somewhere in the 
              environment. One strategy an ecophage could employ to evade detection 
              would be to transfer the heat from its site of activity to some 
              distant site, where the heat could be dispersed more widely and 
              thus would be harder to distinguish from background levels. </p>
<p>For example, a Peltier-effect cooling system (<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> refrigeration) 
              could transfer heat from the ecophages through an underground wiring 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> to a distant distributed thermal radiator system, possibly 
              diluting the thermal signature by 1000:1 or more. Fluid-driven heat 
              pipes or a complex of <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> diamond pipes (diamond is an excellent 
              heat conductor) might also be effective. Another ecophagic strategy 
              might be to acquire the biological feedstock at a given surface 
              site but not process it there, transporting it instead to a distant 
              location where the thermal signature of chemical processing could 
              be better disguised&#8212;for example, in a processing facility located 
              deep underground. </p>
<p>All such approaches can still be defeated if a high-resolution, 
              high-sensitivity global thermal map has been created, good baseline 
              statistics have been collected for many years for both surface and 
              subsurface temperatures, and they are closely and continuously monitored 
              using sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-recognition software.</p>
<p>For additional safety, some random sampling of materials could 
              be done, in addition to simply monitoring heat signatures. However, 
              note that only a thorough examination (including partial disassembly) 
              of found objects will suffice to determine whether they are products 
              of molecular manufacturing (MM) or not.<br>
</p>
<h3> 3.2 NONSPECIFIC IMMUNITY DEFENSES </h3>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">Instrument</a>alities should be put in place that constitute a general, 
              nonspecific response to any perceived ecophagic threat. For example, 
              inspection nanorobots could be deployed to any area that is suspected 
              of having any sign of possible ecophagic activity.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
            If ecophages are detected, there could be a response from pre-positioned 
            stores of generic defensive nanorobots manufactured by a global network 
            of defensive nanofactory stations that have been put in place well 
            in advance of the outbreak of the threat. These first-line defensive 
            nanorobots will have generic abilities to disable ecophages&#8212;e.g., 
            sensor blinding, spray painting to ruin energy-producing solar cells, 
            and perhaps some capability of mechanical disassembly or physical 
            crushing, electric shock, e-beam irradiation, and so forth. These 
            defenses will buy time for the specific immunity defenses to kick 
            in. 
            <h3> 3.3 SPECIFIC IMMUNITY DEFENSES</h3>
<p>A second set of instrumentalities that should be put in place comprise 
              a specific, targeted immunity response to a perceived ecophagic 
              threat. These defenses would be designed to attack the particular 
              ecophage in question. They could not be launched until the ecophage 
              was identified and its weaknesses determined. A regular <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              of collecting and inspecting nanorobots found in the environment 
              via sampling from randomly selected locations would help to establish 
              a statistical baseline on extant nanorobot populations and would 
              also provide an early warning of new nanorobotic capabilities that 
              are being fielded.<br>
<br>
              The ability to detect and identify an object implies the ability, 
              if necessary, to selectively deliver energy into that object. Ultrasound 
              in the proper resonant frequency could deliver destructive amounts 
              of energy into pre-specified and molecularly precise objects. </p>
<p>Specific surface chemistries can be attacked via the relevant chemical 
              reactions. Chemical bonds can also be broken by <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanta" target="_blank">quanta</a> 
              at the correct frequency. For example, an ecophage that internally 
              employed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanosynthesis" target="_blank">mechanosynthetic 
              tooltips</a> possessing Ge-C bonds might be disabled by exposure 
              to 21 THz infrared radiation, the approximate resonant stretching 
              frequency of the Ge-C dimer bond.</p>
<p>Similarly, exposure to GHz microwaves might pump unplanned energy 
              into purely mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of nanorobots, such as the logic 
              rods in mechanical nanocomputers operating at GHz frequencies, thus 
              permanently damaging them, if these moving components incorporate 
              any unbalanced electrical charge or conductive pathways in their 
              molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>.<br>
<br>
              A methodology similar to that used by the human immune system is 
              another option. Surfaces <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> to those of undesirable environmental 
              contaminants, including MM devices, can be created and used to selectively 
              bind MM devices and isolate them. Sensors, solar cells and other 
              key parts of an MM device can be targeted as well. Such specific 
              anti-MM defenses would be launched at a detected infection, although 
              it is, of course, unlikely that permission would be given to carpet 
              the entire Earth (and its atmosphere and oceans) with them.<br>
<br>
              While molecular manufacturing systems must fight <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> to build 
              molecularly precise systems, countermeasures can work with entropy. 
              In other words, on the molecular level, as on any other, once detection 
              has occurred, destruction is far easier than creation and takes 
              much less time. As a result of this, except for ecophagic populations 
              much greater than the populations of countermeasure devices, the 
              time taken by countermeasures to eliminate ecophagic infestations 
              will be dominated by search time. Search time should usually be 
              inversely proportional to the concentration of targets. </p>
<p>For this reason, an exponentially replicating ecophage population 
              can be stopped by a constant-sized population of anti-ecophages, 
              or more precisely, a constant concentration (per volume) of anti-ecophages. 
              This implies two things: (a) You don't need to respond to an ecophage 
              outbreak instantly; and (b) You don't need to get into an exponential 
              race.<br>
<br>
              As MM populations in the environment are monitored, any <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://www.britannica.com/nobel/micro/88_96.html" target="_blank">non-Brownian 
              diffusion</a> or rapid increase in incidence should flag the attention 
              of authorities who might examine the relevant population <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/schema_entry.html">schema</a>ta 
              of the threatening nanodevice, and simulations of the device's behavior. 
              If they are concerned, they should authorize the release of countermeasures 
              stockpiled by a large and diffuse planetary grid of nanofactories. 
              Countermeasures need not be self-replicating, and in fact should 
              not be, since that would require them to be complex and slow; and 
              in addition, would raise the possibility that they could be preempted 
              for use as ecophages. <br>
<br>
              Division of labor is generally efficient, and the production of 
              countermeasures by specialized productive systems is an example 
              of this. Although a grid of productive nanofactories must be created 
              and stocked with feedstock and energy ahead of time for countermeasure 
              production, specific countermeasures need not be created until replicators 
              pose an immediate danger, so long as the total productive <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              available for countermeasure production is sufficiently great.<br>
<br>
              Countermeasures could take the form of small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, nanomachines, 
              or macroscale devices such as ultrasound generators, sorting devices, 
              or even bush robots with target specific branch tips. ("Bush 
              robots" will have an immovable base that repeatedly branches 
              in a fractal way into trillions of nanoscale fingers. [<a href="#f4">4</a>]) 
              Collectively, specific countermeasures can be seen as the equivalent 
              of specific immunity. It could be innocuous, automatic, and continuous. 
              But unlike specific immunity in biology, ecophage countermeasures 
              can be subject to higher level analysis and centralized control, 
              enabling their modification to correct any unintended damage.<br>
</p>
<h3> 3.4 EMERGENCY DEFENSES</h3>
<p>A third set of instrumentalities should be put in place that constitute 
              broad-brush emergency responses to a larger ecophagic threat. We 
              cannot rule out the possibility of rare situations in which the 
              normal nonspecific defenses fail, and successful specific defenses 
              cannot be mobilized. Examples of such a dire emergency would be 
              the existence of ecophagic replicators too numerous for cleanup 
              or the recognition that an uncharacterized ecophage or one with 
              no known specific countermeasures is replicating unexpectedly rapidly.<br>
<br>
              In such cases, it would be helpful if the NanoShield included emergency 
              defenses that would be effective against a wide range of ecophagy 
              types. With even broader impact than non-specific immunity responses, 
              the use of emergency defenses would disrupt lives and economic and 
              ecological systems. But the mere existence of these relevant defenses, 
              prepared but unused, will not cause harm.<br>
<br>
              Many of the proposed emergency responses will themselves cause additional 
              damage during the process of halting the ecophagic outbreak, much 
              as a surgeon's scalpel damages the tissue through which it cuts 
              during an operation to remove a more life-threatening tumor. For 
              this reason, emergency responses should be considered a last resort 
              and should be activated only in the direst of circumstances. In 
              the aftermath, advanced molecular manufacturing and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> 
              should allow us to repair many forms of damage to biological <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s, 
              including <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> human beings. Much, although perhaps not all, 
              of the natural global ecological infrastructure might be reconstituted 
              if proper genetic and statistical records have been maintained that 
              describe the location and design of every large object and organism.<br>
<br>
              The possible misuse of specific countermeasures or emergency defenses 
              is inevitably a serious concern, but one that should be almost as 
              manageable as the risk of misuse of nuclear weapons. We say only 
              "almost as manageable" because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_manufacturing" target="_blank">MM</a> 
              seems to favor evasion more than detection. This makes infiltration 
              and infiltration-dependent hacking of the defensive systems themselves 
              easier than it is in the case of nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>Also, unlike nuclear defense monitoring systems, such as Geiger 
              counters, anti-ecophagy defense systems leave footprints when taking 
              in information from the outside world, in the form of the data stream 
              from their continual monitoring activities. <br>
<br>
              Some examples of emergency ecophagy defenses are:</p>
<p> a) Skysweepers. Air-filtering nanoscoop devices could filter the 
              whole Earth's atmosphere, thereby removing all aerovores, as first 
              described by Freitas [<a href="#f3">3</a>].<br>
<br>
              b) <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_fog_entry.html">Utility Fog</a>. Massive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_fog" target="_blank">utility 
              fog</a> curtains capable of establishing filters for the separation 
              of the atmosphere into compartments, containing an ecophagy outbreak, 
              or enabling the rapid establishment of expanding sterile bubbles 
              (barriers within which organisms can be safe from any ecophagy that 
              they don't bring in with them). Curtains may defend their integrity 
              with multiple layers, with sensors that can recognize damage and 
              respond with films of relatively inert substances that cannot be 
              modified by known <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanosynthesis" target="_blank">mechanochemical</a> 
              reactions (at room temperature or in general).<br>
<br>
              c) Solar Shades. Large solar shields that can be used to block the 
              sunlight reaching Earth's surface, thus denying power or reducing 
              the power available to solar-powered replicators. Prompt disablement 
              or sequestration over a short time period of ecophages rendered 
              dormant or lethargic may allow most terrestrial plant life to survive 
              the prolonged darkness unharmed.<br>
<br>
              d) Localized Heating. Localized heating increases thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s 
              in the mechanosynthetic tools used by the ecophage to build new 
              molecular structures, causing onboard temperature-sensitive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanosynthesis" target="_blank">mechanosynthetic</a> 
              reactions to become unreliable. This would lead to fatal errors 
              in the fabrication and assembly of daughter ecophages and most probably 
              the permanent poisoning of the onboard mechanosynthetic tools. Localized 
              heating may be an inevitable side effect of the use of other specific 
              countermeasures at high power but can also be obtained more directly 
              by relatively simple measures.<br>
<br>
              For example, an orbiting mirror could be used to focus concentrated 
              sunlight into a specific ecophagic outbreak region, with the duration 
              and intensity of localized temperature increases carefully controlled 
              to maximize damage to the ecophages and minimize damage to the environment. 
              Alternatively, an orbiting <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beam could be directed onto the 
              ecophagic outbreak site (heating the ecophages). Ideally any temperature 
              changes would be confined to the smallest possible area.<br>
<br>
              e) Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). Nuclear weapon explosions are known 
              to create very sharp pulses of high-intensity electromagnetic radiation 
              that can destroy electronic equipment. EMP can also be generated 
              by non-nuclear systems. Ecophages with onboard nanoelectronic components, 
              including sensors, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, electrical motors or generators, and 
              power conduits, would be seriously damaged and probably rendered 
              entirely inoperative, if exposed to EMP. Only ecophages with all-mechanical 
              inner workings or that are heavily shielded would be immune to EMP 
              damage. Of course, many microelectronic and macroelectonic devices 
              that are not "hardened" (shielded and otherwise protected 
              against radiation) will be similarly damaged and would have to be 
              rebuilt in the aftermath, although EMP generators could be deployed 
              against ecophagic outbreaks in limited areas, using directional 
              antennas to minimize damage to electronic devices. One important 
              benefit of this approach is that EMP could be used against ecophages 
              infesting populated areas, without causing significant biological 
              damage to living things.<br>
<br>
              f) Radiation. Finally, high-power emitters of fairly penetrating 
              radiation, possibly x-rays or <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermionic_emission" target="_blank">thermionic 
              emitters</a>, can be used to destroy all large molecularly structured 
              systems within a large volume. Radiation can be tuned to minimize 
              interaction with organic tissue, particularly with key tissues such 
              as the nervous system, but basically this proposal relies on nanomedical 
              systems that can be rapidly deployed to repair nanoscale damage 
              before it brings about larger scale and more complex forms of damage.<br>
<br>
              This proposal may work well with (b), enabling organisms to be sterilized 
              while they enter quarantined compartments. Other methods of sterilization 
              include the use of nanomachines to remove all molecules from an 
              organism's body that are not pre-characterized as "normal." 
              This proposal is fairly similar to a generalized version of what 
              human immune systems typically try to accomplish, e.g., the removal 
              of everything except an enumerated list of molecule types, so the 
              immune system might actually be enlisted to aid in the identification 
              of nanosystems that natural immune cells have no way to attack. 
              Biocompatible surfaces are likely to be well characterized in nanomedicine, 
              so such surfaces can probably be identified by cleanup nanomachines 
              unless the ecophages have masked surfaces to evade detection. </p>
<h3>3.5 NEW MONITORING AGENCIES</h3>
<p>Each <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> participating in the NanoShield should establish 
              and fund a new monitoring agency <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to existing governmental 
              agencies that already monitor outbreaks of computer viruses&#8212;most 
              notably the US Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency 
              Readiness Team (US-CERT), the world's premier public-sector computer 
              security monitoring agency [<a href="#f5">5</a>]. Other analogous 
              monitoring efforts include the Tsunami Warning System [<a href="#f6">6</a>] 
              operated by NOAA and the US National Weather Service, and the Spaceguard 
              [<a href="#f7">7</a>] telescopic monitoring effort, which continuously 
              searches the skies for evidence of an approaching asteroid capable 
              of impacting the Earth.<br>
<br>
              The proposed new nanotech monitoring agencies would be charged with 
              initiating the early studies and preliminary <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation of the 
              NanoShield. Each country's agency should coordinate with the other 
              agencies and when they are ready to establish active defenses outside 
              their own countries, they should establish a lead body to handle 
              this.<br>
<br>
              The ultimate objectives of these nanotech monitoring agencies, as 
              originally noted by Freitas [<a href="#f3">3</a>], would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Initiating a long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> program designed to acquire 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and capability needed to counteract ecophagic replicators, 
                including scenario-building and threat analysis with numerical 
                simulations, measure/countermeasure analysis, theory and design 
                of global monitoring systems capable of fast detection and response, 
                IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) discrimination protocols, and 
                eventually the design of relevant nanorobotic systemic defensive 
                capabilities and infrastructure.<br>
<br>
                "A related long-term recommendation is to initiate a global 
                system of comprehensive <i>in situ</i> ecosphere surveillance, 
                potentially including possible nanorobot activity signatures (e.g., 
                changes in greenhouse gas concentrations), multispectral surface 
                imaging to detect disguised signatures, and direct local nanorobot 
                census sampling on land, sea, and air, as warranted by the pace 
                of development of new MM capabilities."<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p><br>
              This would lead to various practical early-stage monitoring activities 
              that could be implemented today, including most importantly [<a href="#f3">3</a>]:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p> "Continuous comprehensive infrared surveillance of Earth's 
                surface by geostationary satellites, both to monitor the current 
                biomass <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>y and to detect (and then investigate) any rapidly-developing 
                artificial hotspots. This could be an extension of current or

<h2> 4. UNSTABLE ARMS RACE: NONREPLICATING NANOWEAPONS</h2>
<p>Molecular manufacturing also raises the possibility of horrifically 
              effective nonreplicating nanoweapons. The difference in purpose 
              between a nanotech weapon and an ecophage is that an ecophage is 
              meant to destroy biological matter, while nanotech weapons can have 
              far greater <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of purposes, including killing only specific 
              parties. Ecophages must devote significant resources to replication, 
              whereas nanoweapons can focus solely on destruction. This means 
              that active nanoweapons can be far more dangerous per gram than 
              ecophages, and can act much more rapidly because they need not waste 
              time replicating.</p>
<p>As an example, the smallest <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> is about 200 microns. This creates 
              a plausible size estimate for a nanotech-built antipersonnel weapon 
              capable of seeking and injecting toxin into unprotected humans. 
              The human lethal dose of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism" target="_blank">botulism</a> 
              toxin is about 100 nanograms, or about 1/100 the volume of the weapon. 
              As many as 50 billion toxin-carrying devices&#8212;theoretically 
              enough to kill every human on earth&#8212;could be packed into a 
              single suitcase.</p>
<p>Guns of all sizes would be far more powerful, and their bullets 
              could be self-guided. Aerospace <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> would be far lighter and 
              higher performance. Built with minimal or no metal, it would be 
              much harder to spot on radar. Embedded computers would allow remote 
              activation of any weapon, and more compact power handling would 
              allow greatly improved <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>.</p>
<p>Other possible nanoweapons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily large numbers of any <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>.<br>
</li>
<li>Deuterium filters for separating deuterium from seawater.<br>
</li>
<li>Microscale isotopic separation of uranium.<br>
</li>
<li>Massive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_fog" target="_blank">utility 
                fog</a> banks that simply contain all movement in a large region.<br>
</li>
<li>Computer viruses that make other people's nanofactories build 
                bombs.<br>
</li>
<li>Inhalable or skin-penetrating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that travel to the nervous 
                system, allowing outside sources to take over inputs or outputs.<br>
</li>
<li>Massive nanofactories that consume a substantial fraction of 
                earth's CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas barely scratch the surface of what's possible.</p>
<p> An important question is whether nanotech weapons'both replicating 
              and nonreplicating'would be stabilizing or destabilizing. Nuclear 
              weapons, for example, could perhaps be credited with preventing 
              major wars since their <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>. However, nanotech weapons differ 
              from nuclear weapons. Nuclear stability stems from at least three 
              factors. The most obvious is the massive destructiveness of all-out 
              nuclear war.<br>
<br>
              All-out nanotech war is probably equivalent in the short term, but 
              nuclear weapons also have a high long-term cost of use (fallout, 
              contamination) that would be much lower with nanotech weapons. Nuclear 
              weapons cause indiscriminate destruction; nanotech weapons could 
              be targeted. Nuclear weapons require massive research effort and 
              industrial development, which can be tracked far more easily than 
              nanotech weapons development.<br>
<br>
              Finally, nanotech weapons can be developed much more rapidly due 
              to faster, cheaper prototyping. Greater uncertainty of the capabilities 
              of the adversary, less response time to an attack, and better targeted 
              destruction of an enemy's visible resources during an attack all 
              make nanotech arms races less stable. Also, unless nanotech is tightly 
              controlled, the number of nanotech nations in the world could be 
              much higher than the number of nuclear nations, increasing the chance 
              of a regional conflict blowing up.<br>
<br>
              Bottom line: all problems that could be caused by nanotech weapons 
              might not be solvable by the NanoShield alone, but having the NanoShield 
              in place would provide an excellent first line of defense. We welcome 
              suggestions from the public on how to improve the NanoShield so 
              it can better handle nonreplicating nanoweapons.</p>
<h3>4.1 RISKS OF NANOSHIELD</h3>
<p>The risk that the NanoShield would malfunction and accidentally 
              destroy property or life on this planet can be made as close to 
              zero as desired by increasing the reliability and redundancy of 
              control systems. The greater and true risk of NanoShield implementation 
              is that it might be purposely abused by people. For example, a NanoShield 
              in malevolent hands could be used to oppress individuals, groups, 
              or entire countries.<br>
<br>
              To minimize this risk, authority to activate the NanoShield should 
              be distributed among as many responsible but competing interests 
              as is practical, consistent with the need for potentially rapid 
              decision making by parties who have demonstrated by past practice 
              that they are ready and willing to take decisive <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> if the need 
              arises. One good solution might be to have the NanoShield controlled 
              by a coalition of democracies, perhaps NATO. </p>
<p>Less ideal would be to vest control of the NanoShield in the hands 
              of a single strong democracy such as the United States or Australia. 
              A more dangerous outcome may occur if all democracies ignore this 
              vital issue and allow, by default, a dictatorship such as China, 
              or a small private group, or even a lone individual, to control 
              the NanoShield. It is unlikely that the UN can effectively administer 
              the NanoShield, due to structural problems, including its inability 
              to make rapid decisions, the veto power of non-democratic nations 
              having permanent seats on the Security Council, and the large number 
              of dictatorships represented among the UN membership. </p>
<h2> 5. INFOSHIELD PROPOSAL </h2>
<p>To further increase global security and to lessen the need for 
              the most dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of the NanoShield to be activated, we 
              recommend consideration of the Lifeboat Foundation <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://lifeboat.com/ex/infoshield" target="_blank">InfoShield 
              Proposal </a> [<a href="#f10">10</a>], to be implemented alongside 
              the NanoShield. </p>
            The InfoShield would deal with the problem that a powerful nanoweapon 
            could be developed in secret that could wipe out life on the earth 
            before the NanoShield could deal with it. 
            <p>The InfoShield system would consist of multiple parallel, globally 
              deployed, nanotechnology-based surveillance systems, such as "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_dust" target="_blank">smart 
              dust</a>" (micro- or nanosize networked sensors that could 
              covertly detect anything). In addition, "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance" target="_blank">sousveillance</a>" 
              systems could be used. These would enable the public to turn the 
              tables and monitor the government (and perhaps others) via tools 
              like smart-dust data feeds&#8212;a possible checks-and-balance system 
              for the coming nano age.<br>
</p>
<p><b>5.1. TRANSPARENCY VS. <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">PRIVACY</a><br>
</b><br>
              Of course, a smart dust system could also be used to abridge long-held 
              Constitutionally-protected rights to privacy. Special enabling legislation 
              or even an Amendment to the US Constitution might be required to 
              implement smart dust in a manner that would pass Constitutional 
              muster at the US Supreme Court. But as noted by Neil Jacobstein, 
              Chairman of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://www.imm.org/" target="_blank">Institute 
              for Molecular Manufacturing</a>: "Nanotechnology-enabled transparency 
              and accountability will produce the worst form of government, except 
              for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."<br>
<br>
              Is it OK for governments to monitor civilians with quintillions 
              of sensors, and for civilians to monitor their governments with 
              quintillions of sensors? Or is that irresponsible and dangerous? 
              The bigger question is: do you want the NanoShield to try to handle 
              every possible nanoattack (we are not guaranteeing that it can handle 
              all nanoweapon types, although we are pretty confident that it can 
              handle ecophagy attacks)? Or do you want to try to stop hostile 
              forces from unleashing the attacks in the first place&#8212;which 
              would require extensive surveillance? Each attack stopped is one 
              less attack that might have overwhelmed the NanoShield. </p>
<p>The Lifeboat Foundation suggests that the InfoShield proposal is 
              a good first step in trying to prevent the attacks from happening 
              in the first place. (Nothing is likely to prevent 100% of the attacks, 
              which is why you will also need a NanoShield.)<br>
<br>
              But even combining smart dust with the three-layer defensive system 
              proposed for NanoShield cannot provide an absolute guarantee of 
              safety against all possible nanotech threats, especially given the 
              power that personal nanofactories [<a href="#f11">11</a>], which 
              could be acquired by individuals, including terrorists. But NanoShield 
              should provide an excellent first line of defense, and adding smart 
              dust would further strengthen it.<br>
</p>
<h2>6. CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Any particular ecophagy or nonreplicating nanoweapon defense can 
              be circumvented, but the number of people proposing ecophagy defenses 
              is likely to exceed the number building ecophages by many orders 
              of magnitude. A mix of defenses should be deployed, preferably by 
              multiple agencies, to minimize the risk of infiltration.<br>
<br>
              Some of these defenses should be announced publicly in order to 
              allow a <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a> community to try their strength against them, as 
              is common with modern computer security, while other defenses should 
              be kept secret to avoid their circumvention. In this case, the total 
              barrier of a multilayer defensive system like NanoShield should 
              be sufficient to prevent the effective malevolent use of self-replicating 
              nanosystems, and should provide an excellent first line of defense 
              against the threat of even more potent nanoweaponry.<br>
<br>
              However, it is <i>not</i> necessary to implement the entire NanoShield 
              plan to be reasonably protected against ecophagic attacks. Even 
              a partial implementation would greatly increase the odds that an 
              ecophagic or nonreplicating nanoweapon attack would leave some survivors 
              and would easily be able to handle the bioweapon and pandemic problems 
              that the BioShield proposal [1] was developed to handle. </p>
<p>The reason the NanoShield could handle bioweapons and pandemic 
              problems is that the NanoShield would be designed to handle a large 
              range of designs, from carbon-based to silicon-based to boron-based, 
              to ecophages with virtually no onboard <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, as well as 
              those with onboard sophisticated computers, all-mechanical inner 
              workings or designs that include electronic components, etc. In 
              contrast, bioweapons and pandemics would have a much smaller range 
              of designs and therefore be easier for the NanoShield to defeat.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Long post...
<br>
My comments &amp; responses to various sections of the Lifeboat Nanoshield Proposal
<br>
In 2. Background,
<br>
2nd paragraph, "The human immune system does not have to recognize dangerous invaders the way a nanotech system would. Our immune system merely has to recognize non-invaders and attack everything else. Another important distinction is that biological immune cells ' and the invaders that they must combat ' will both replicate at biological speeds and energy levels."
<br>
<br>
Could there be a signature or other trusted identifier that would allow all "good" or trusted things to be recognized as such?
<br>
<br>
3rd paragraph (&amp; I may just be being ignorant here): "In contrast, a contest of exponentially growing numbers of nanotech devices, by contrast, would cook the biosphere in waste heat [3], especially if a large number of novel replicating nanodevices were released simultaneously, and if a different type of defensive device were needed to stop each of them."
<br>
<br>
If this is so, why don't we now cook the biosphere through the exponential replication of biological organisms, such as bacteria?
<br>
<br>
4th paragraph: " Microbes are selected to not overwhelm it too quickly, otherwise plagues would burn out and the microbes would also lose."
<br>
<br>
Don't plagues burn out?
<br>
<br>
In 3. The Nanoshield Proposal,
<br>
<br>
Section 3.1, 5th paragraph (2nd inset paragraph): "Unless there were a lot of ecophages concentrated in a small area, the volume of such effluent discharges would be relatively small, and any wind could rapidly disperse the effluents, even if they could somehow be recognized as artificial."
<br>
<br>
Does the waste heat burning up the biosphere negate the idea of small effluent discharges (if we can call waste heat effluent here), or are we talking about small-scale number of ecophages, non-exponential?
<br>
<br>
Next paragraph: "Ecophages could package their wastes into compressed-gas or solid-matter pellets and then drop them into the dirt. If they were covered with a camouflage coating, these droppings would be undetectable."
<br>
<br>
Again - I think exponentially increasing numbers of anything will produce noticeable waste...unless again, we're talking about a smaller number of these things.
<br>
<br>
Paragraph 15: "Manual inspection nanorobots would then be sent to only those regions identified by the thermal pattern recognition software as scoring high on the "possible trouble" index. The atmosphere and oceans will need to be monitored as well."
<br>
<br>
This makes a lot of sense. But are normal environmental heat effects minimal and stable enough that such monitoring wouldn't either turn up mostly false positives, or (if tuned the other direction) miss relevant thermal events?
<br>
<br>
Also, discussion in &amp; around paragraph 15 - ideas on how to solve the issues at stake:
<br>
One reason to keep a profit motive economy may be to encourage crowds of researchers / programmers / entrepreneurs to come up with solutions. Solving a problem in massively parallel fashion - by having lots of people &amp; organizations trying, of their own volition, to solve the problems for profit - will produce a plethora of ideas and products that a few people won't.
<br>
<br>
3.2 Non-Specific Immunity Defenses
<br>
<br>
I would think that international participation and cooperation would b essential here. That is addressed later in the document, though.
<br>
<br>
3.3 Specific Immunity Defenses
<br>
<br>
My comments here aren't tied to specific paragraphs.
<br>
<br>
Comment related to 1st page of 3.3:
<br>
Open source designers hacking and beating on designs, as well as coming up with their own would be important here. Perhaps servers, pizza and Coke could be provided as incentives... :-)
<br>
<br>
Comments related to 2nd page of 3.3:
<br>
1: How can we be certain that immuno-defensive "bots" don't overwhelm the biosphere with waste heat (as discussed earlier in the document)? An attack by otherwise useless nanobots could be designed to do just that. The attacker sends in hordes of extra-cheap nanodevices that are alien but otherwise harmless, and the defense system jumps into play, generating tons of waste heat and self-damaging the defender.
<br>
<br>
2: An early immune system might be widely distributed and seeded into the environment which might as a side effect (or as a stealth justification) be used to clean up environmental hazards, toxins, spills, trash, etc. (Also, perhaps as a means to rid our bodies of some of the same. - as substitutes for today's common inoculations, e.g.) Of course, we would need to be pretty sure we know what we're doing to a complex biosphere. A stupid and simple example: clean up by destroying mosquitoes and frogs lose an important food resource, and frog-eating cranes lose an important food source, etc.
<br>
<br>
3: Regarding wide distribution of a grid of defensive productive nanofactories. Free (or all) Personal Nanofactories could have emergency overrides that would allow them to be used for defensive measures, including building additional nanofactories specifically for building defensive bots.
<br>
This is a good reason to give away PNs very early on once they come into existence / production. They become dual-use: feed, clothe, educate &amp; house people everywhere, and act as an instant defense when needed as they are already everyplace by the time we have an attack. Then we don't need to pay or make the effort to put the exclusively defensive grid in place.
<br>
It seems that they would need to be designed to self-digest or self-destruct if other efforts were made to reprogram, hack, or otherwise repurpose said devices.
<br>
<br>
In 3.4 Emergency Defenses
<br>
<br>
3.4 e) Using EMP to disable "bad" nanodevices and then rebuilding in the aftermath is an intensely nontrivial task, In a populated area, we are talking about billions of devices: computers, watches, cars, Tivos, etc. It would bring the local economy to a standstill, not to mention thousands of lifesaving devices, automobile controls, radios so people can hear how to handle the emergency, cell phones, you name it. Maybe not so high a cost to pay when the alternative might be extermination, admittedly, but still a very high price.
<br>
<br>
3.4 f) "This proposal is fairly similar to a generalized version of what human immune systems typically try to accomplish, e.g., the removal of everything except an enumerated list of molecule types, so the immune system might actually be enlisted to aid in the identification of nanosystems that natural immune cells have no way to attack. "
<br>
<br>
Is this absolutely true? I may be just ignorant here, but is it possible that our immune system removes only specific threats or threat-like circumstances and leaves everything else alone?
<br>
<br>
3.5 New Monitoring Agencies
<br>
<br>
If truly an International effort from the get-go (not some kind of "coalition of the willing") then trust and buy-in will be built in. I think it's necessary if it is to be truly effective, given the amount of damage relatively small states might be able to do when enabled by MM.
<br>
<br>
4. Unstable Arms Race: Nonreplicating Nanoweapons
<br>
<br>
 General discussion-
<br>
<br>
As with MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), the threat of a massive nanotech response (MAND) might serve to deter attacks by states.
<br>
Having greater uncertainty wrt the capabilities of the adversary might actually be a more stable situation due to the possibility of the aforementioned MAND. I hate the idea as policy, but it seems to have worked with nukes (so far).
<br>
As for tightly controlling nanotech - the cat is out of the bag. There are too many nations and organizations working on it now to have any effective control, IMO.
<br>
<br>
4.1 Risks of Nanoshield: "Less ideal would be to vest control of the NanoShield in the hands of a single strong democracy such as the United States or Australia."
<br>
<br>
I agree with this assessment. It might be nice to see an explanation that others (especially within the US) would buy.
<br>
<br>
5. Transparency vs. Privacy
<br>
<br>
Are we ready for ubiquitous surveillance by anyone? Excuse me for being gross for a moment, but is everyone willing to be seen whacking off, eating their boogers, looking at porn, playing with a spouse (or a mistress), doing their taxes, wiping their butts, being alone, staying "in the closet"? Or planning wars?
<br>
<br>
What kind of processing power will it take to monitor all these inputs?
<br>
How are you going to get lawmakers to let it be two-way?
<br>
<br>
The document says (if I may excerpt), "The bigger question is: do you want the NanoShield to try to handle every possible nanoattack ... Or do you want to try to stop hostile forces from unleashing the attacks in the first place..."
<br>
<br>
This reminds me of "Are you with us or against us?"
<br>
Or - do you let us listen in to your conversations or are you with the terrorists?
<br>
There may be other choices. I don't know what they are at the moment, but perhaps this is the moment to ask, before we accept universal surveillance. It is arguable whether ubiquitous sensors are inevitable. 
<br>
What are some other choices?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>At least it can't work for light-powered bots that have an albedo (reflectiveness) matching their surroundings. A grain of dirt converts some of the sunlight that hits it into heat. A nanobot sitting on that grain of dirt can grab that fraction of sunlight, use it to do work, and let the heat escape--and it will be exactly as much heat (per area) as the grain of dirt would have released.
<br>
<br>
On the positive side, light-powered goo-bots have to be near the surface of things, so this makes them a bit more detectable by inspection. You only have to examine the top millimeter or so of dirt. 
<br>
<br>
In water, you have to examine the top 30 meters/yards or deeper to catch light-powered bots. Nanobots in water could be pretty nasty. On the other hand, the albedo-matching trick would require near-transparency, because it would be trying to match water.

If we cannot bring to heel terrorist groups and rogue states like North Korea, what hope is there for the rest of us? Is it not time for us to seriously consider a world state or at least a federation of world states that act in concert against potential threats like grey goo? The UN has outlived its usefulness. A mere talk shop will do no good. What is needed is to actively federate various nations. The  EU comes to mind. the US and Canada as one federated entity is another obvious possibility. The whole of South America probably comes third on my list as does the whole of South Asia.It is these super state entities that will then have to take the process forward. A single united world policy towards the grey goo threats of this world can at least then be considered. Till then while the technicalities will endlessly fascinate us, it seems they will not ensure concerted action.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have translated into Russian 'Lifeboat Foundation Nanoshield' <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100408154612/http://www.scribd.com/doc/12113758/Nano-Shield" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/doc/12113758/Nano-Shield</a> and I have some thoughts about it:  
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) The effective mean of defense against ecofagy would be to turn in advance all the matter on the Earth into nanorobots. Just as every human body is composed of living cells (although this does not preclude the emergence of cancer cells). The visible world would not change. All object will consist of nano-cells, which would have sufficient immune potential to resist almost any foreseeable ecofagy. (Except purely informational like computer viruses). Even in each leaving cell would be small nanobot, which would control it. Maybe the world already consists of nanobots.
<br>
2) The authors of the project suggest that ecofagic attack would consist of two phases - reproduction and destruction. However, creators of ecofagy, could make three phases - first phase would be a quiet distribution throughout the Earth's surface, under surfase, in the water and air. In this phase nanorobots will multiply in slow rate, and most importantly, sought to be removed from each other on the maximum distance. In this case, their concentration everywhere on the Earth as a result would be 1 unit on the cube meter (which makes them unrecognazible). And only after it they would start to proliferate intensely, simultaneously creating nanorobots soldiers who did not replicate, but attack the defensive system. In doing so, they first have to suppress protection systems, like AIDS. Or as a modern computer viruses switches off the antivirus. Creators of the future ecofagy must understand it. As the second phase of rapid growth begins everywhere on the surface of the Earth, then it would be impossible to apply the tools of destruction such as nuclear strikes or aimed rays, as this would mean the death of the planet in any case - and simply would not be in store enough bombs. 
<br>
3) The authors overestimate the reliability of protection systems. Any system has a control center, which is a blank spot. The authors implicitly assume that any person with a certain probability can suddenly become terrorist willing to destroy the world (and although the probability is very small, a large number of people living on Earth make it meaningful). But because such a system will be managed by people, they may also want to destroy the world. Nanoshield could destroy the entire world after one erroneous command. (Even if the AI manages it, we cannot say a priori that the AI cannot go mad.) The authors believe that multiple overlapping of Nanoshield protection from hackers will make it 100 % safe, but no known computer system is 100 % safe ' but all major computer programs were broken by hackers, including Windows and IPod.
<br>
4) Nanoshield could develop something like autoimmunity reaction. The author's idea that it is possible to achieve 100 % reliability by increasing the number of control systems is very superficial, as well as the more complex is the system, the more difficult is to calculate all the variants of its behavior, and the more likely it will fail in the spirit of the chaos theory. 
<br>
5) Each cubic meter of oceanic water contains 77 million living beings (on the northern Atlantic, as the book 'Zoology of Invertebrates' tells). Hostile ecofages can easily camouflage under natural living beings, and vice versa; the ability of natural living beings to reproduce, move and emit heat will significantly hamper detection of ecofages, creating high level of false alarms. Moreover, ecofages may at some stage in their development be fully biological creatures, where all blueprints of nanorobot will be recorded in DNA, and thus be almost no distinguishable from the normal cell. 
<br>
6) There are significant differences between ecofages and computer viruses. The latter exist in the artificial environment that is relatively easy to control - for example, turn off the power, get random access to memory, boot from other media, antivirus could be instantaneous delivered to any computer. Nevertheless, a significant portion of computers were infected with a virus, but many users are resigned to the presence of a number of malware on their machines, if it does not slow down much their work. 
<br>
7) Compare: Stanislaw Lem wrote a story 'Darkness and mold' with main plot about ecofages. 
<br>
8) The problem of Nanoshield must be analyzed dynamically in time - namely, the technical perfection of Nanoshield should precede technical perfection of nanoreplikators in any given moment. From this perspective, the whole concept seems very vulnerable, because to create an effective global Nanoshield require many years of development of nanotechnology - the development of constructive, and political development - while creating primitive ecofages capable, however, completely destroy the biosphere, is required much less effort. Example: Creating global missile defense system (ABM ' still not exist) is much more complex technologically and politically, than the creation of intercontinental nuclear missiles. 
<br>
9) You should be aware that in the future will not be the principal difference between computer viruses and biological viruses and nanorobots - all them are information, in case of availability of any 'fabs' which can transfer information from one carrier to another. Living cells could construct nanorobots, and vice versa; spreading over computer networks, computer viruses can capture bioprinters or nanofabs and force them to perform dangerous bioorganizms or nanorobots (or even malware could be integrated into existing computer programs, nanorobots or DNA of artificial organisms). These nanorobots can then connect to computer networks (including the network which control Nanoshield) and send their code in electronic form. In addition to these three forms of the virus: nanotechnology, biotechnology and computer, are possible other forms, for example, cogno - that is transforming the virus in some set of ideas in the human brain which push the man to re-write computer viruses and nanobots. Idea of 'hacking' is now such a meme.
<br>
10) It must be noted that in the future artificial intelligence will be much more accessible, and thus the viruses would be much more intelligent than today's computer viruses, also applies to nanorobots: they will have a certain understanding of reality, and the ability to quickly rebuild itself, even to invent its innovative design and adapt to new environments. Essential question of ecofagy is whether individual nanorobots are independent of each other, as the bacteria cells, or they will act as a unified army with a single command and communication systems. In the latter case, it is possible to intercept the management of hostile army ecofages. 
<br>
11) All that is suitable to combat ecofagy, is suitable as a defensive (and possibly offensive) weapons in nanowar. 
<br>
12) Nanoshield is possible only as global organization. If there is part of the Earth which is not covered by it, Nanoshield will be useless (because there nanorobots will multiply in such quantities that it would be impossible to confront them). It is an effective weapon against people and organizations. So, it should occur only after full and final political unification of the globe. The latter may result from either World War for the unification of the planet, either by merging of humanity in the face of terrible catastrophes, such as flash of ecofagy. In any case, the appearance of Nanoshield must be preceded by some accident, which means a great chance of loss of humanity. 
<br>
13) Discovery of 'cold fusion' or other non-conventional energy sources will make possible much more rapid spread of ecofagy, as they will be able to live in the bowels of the earth and would not require solar energy. 
<br>
14) It is wrong to consider separately self-replicating and non-replitcating nanoweapons. Some kinds of ecofagy can produce nano-soldiers attacking and killing all life. (This ecofagy can become a global tool of blackmail.) It has been said that to destroy all people on the Earth can be enough a few kilograms of nano-soldiers. Some kinds of ecofagy in early phase could dispersed throughout the world, very slowly and quietly multiply and move, and then produce a number of nano-soldiers and attack humans and defensive systems, and then begin to multiply intensively in all areas of the globe. But man, stuffed with nano-medicine, can resist attack of nanosoldier as well as medical nanorobots will be able to neutralize any poisons and tears arteries. In this small nanorobot must attack primarily informational, rather than from a large selection of energy. 
<br>
15) Did the information transparency mean that everyone can access code of dangerous computer virus, or description of nanorobot-ecofage? A world where viruses and knowledge of mass destruction could be instantly disseminated through the tools of information transparency is hardly possible to be secure. We need to control not only nanorobots, but primarily persons or other entities which may run ecofagy. The smaller is the number of these people (for example, scientists-nanotechnologist), the easier would be to control them. On the contrary, the diffusion of knowledge among billions of people will make inevitable emergence of nano-hackers. 
<br>
16) The allegation that the number of creators of defense against ecofagy will exceed the number of creators of ecofagy in many orders of magnitude, seems doubtful, if we consider an example of computer viruses. Here we see that, conversely, the number of virus writers in the many orders of magnitude exceeds the number of firms and projects on anti-virus protection, and moreover, the majority of anti-virus systems cannot work together as they stops each other. Terrorists may be masked by people opposing ecofagy and try to deploy their own system for combat ecofagy, which will contain a tab that allows it to suddenly be reprogrammed for the hostile goal. 
<br>
17) The text implicitly suggests that Nanoshield precedes to the invention of self improving AI of superhuman level. However, from other prognosis we know that this event is very likely, and most likely to occur simultaneously with the flourishing of advanced nanotechnology. Thus, it is not clear in what timeframe the project Nanoshield exist. The developed artificial intelligence will be able to create a better Nanoshield and Infoshield, and means to overcome any human shields. 
<br>
18) We should be aware of equivalence of nanorobots and nanofabrics - first can create second, and vice versa. This erases the border between the replicating and non-replicating nanomachines, because a device not initially intended to replicate itself can construct somehow nanorobot or to reprogram itself into capable for replication nanorobot.
