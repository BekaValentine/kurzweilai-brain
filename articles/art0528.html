<div class="TeaserText">Robert A. Freitas Jr. (author, "Nanomedicine") visualizes a future "vasculoid" (vascular-like machine) that would replace human blood with some 500 trillion nanorobots distributed throughout the body&#8217;s vasculature as a coating. It could eradicate heart disease, stroke, and other vascular problems; remove parasites, bacteria, viruses, and metastasizing cancer cells to limit the spread of bloodborne disease; move lymphocytes faster to improve immune response; reduce susceptibility to chemical, biochemical, and parasitic poisons; improve physical endurance and stamina; and partially protect from various accidents and other physical harm. </div>

<p><i>Originally published March 31, 2002 by the Institute for Molecular 
              Manufacturing. Published on KurzweilAI.net Oct. 22, 2002.</i></p>
<p>Six years ago, while in the midst of writing the first volume of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a> [1], I was delighted to discover the germ of a fascinating 
              idea for a very aggressive nanomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a>, originally 
              called "roboblood," that had just been proposed online [2] at sci.<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> Senior Associate Chris Phoenix. The initial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> elicited considerable enthusiastic discussion, but contained 
              what I regarded as several crucial "show-stopper"-type technical 
              flaws. I contacted Chris directly and we began an intermittent but 
              constructive collaboration that extended through 1996-2002, finally 
              culminating in a detailed technical paper [3] that runs ~100 pages 
              with more than 500 references &#8212; which I can only briefly summarize 
              here.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, I must offer two notes of caution about 
              this work to two distinct audiences of possible readers. First, 
              conservative medical practitioners should be aware that the technical 
              paper summarized in this article is not intended to represent an 
              actual <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering design for a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> nanomedical product. Rather, 
              the purpose is merely to examine a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of appropriate design <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s, 
              scaling issues, and reference designs as a purely theoretical exercise 
              to investigate whether or not the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea of a blood replacement 
              appliance might be feasible, and to determine key limitations of 
              such designs.</p>
<p>Second, <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>- and <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a>ist-oriented readers are warned 
              that, in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to maintain a tight analytical focus, the technical 
              paper necessarily ignores many possible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> nanomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a>s 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cellular, tissue, and organ <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that would clearly 
              be <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible to a molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> capable 
              of building the vasculoid appliance, and that might significantly 
              influence vasculoid <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> or the advisability of 
              its use.</p>
<p>The idea of the vasculoid originated in the asking of a simple 
              question: Once a mature molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> becomes available, 
              could we replace blood with a single, complex robot? This <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> 
              would duplicate all essential thermal and biochemical transport 
              functions of the blood, including circulation of respiratory gases, 
              glucose, hormones, cytokines, waste products, and all necessary 
              cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> would conform to the shape of existing 
              blood vessels. Ideally, it would replace natural blood so thoroughly 
              that the rest of the body would remain, at least physiochemically, 
              essentially unaffected. It is, in effect, a mechanically <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              redesign of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that attempts to integrate 
              itself as an intimate personal appliance with minimal adaptation 
              on the part of the host <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body.</p>
<p>A robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that replaces and extends the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> vascular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              is properly called a "vasculoid," a vascular-like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>; but the 
              vasculoid is more than just an artificial vascular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Rather, 
              it is a member of a class of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>- or volume-filling nanomedical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s whose function applies to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> vascular 
              tree.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> is extremely complex, having ~500 trillion independent 
              cooperating nanorobots. In simplest terms, the vasculoid is a watertight 
              coating of nanomachinery distributed across the luminal surface 
              of the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> vascular tree. This nanomachinery uses a ciliary 
              array to transport <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant nutrients and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> cells to the 
              tissues, containerized either in "tankers" (for <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s) or "boxcars" 
              (for cells). The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> weighs ~2 kg and releases ~30 watts 
              of waste heat at a basal activity level and a maximum of ~200 watts 
              of power at peak activity level. The power dissipation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              body ranges from ~100 watts (basal) to ~1600 watts (peak) [1], so 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> presents no adverse thermogenic consequences to the user. 
              Power is derived from native supplies of glucose and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>, both 
              plentiful in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, as may be common in medical nanorobotic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s [1, 4-8].</p>
<p>The most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> structural <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of the exemplar vasculoid 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> is a ~300 m<sup>2</sup> two-dimensional vascular-surface-conforming 
              array of ~150 trillion "sapphiroid" (i.e., using sapphire-like building 
              materials) <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> plates. (Thermal conductivity favors sapphire over 
              diamond in this application.) These square plates are nanorobots 
              that cover the entire luminal surface of all blood vessels in the 
              body, to one-plate thickness. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> plate is an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              self-contained nanorobot ~1 micron thick and ~2 micron<sup>2</sup> 
              in surface area, a size small enough to allow adequate clearance 
              even in the narrowest <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capillaries.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">Molecule</a>-conveying "docking bays" comprise ~24 trillion, or 16%, 
              of all vasculoid <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> plates. Tankers containing <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s for 
              distribution can dock at these bays and load or unload their cargo. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a>-conveying "cellulocks" are built on "cellulock plates" which 
              span the area of 30 <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> plates, or 60 micron<sup>2</sup> each. 
              Boxcars containing <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> cells for distribution can dock at 
              these cellulocks and load or unload their cargo. With only 32.6 
              billion cellulock plates in the entire vasculoid design, cellulocks 
              occupy the area of 0.978 trillion <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> plates or only 0.65% of 
              the entire vasculoid surface. The remaining ~125 trillion <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 
              plates are reserved for special equipment and other as-yet undefined 
              applications. All nanomachinery within each plate is of modular 
              design, permitting easy replacement and repair by mobile repair 
              nanorobots called vasculocytes [7].</p>
<p>Adjacent plates abut through flexible but watertight mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s on metamorphic bumpers [1] along the entire perimeter 
              of each plate. Each bumper has controllable variable volume, permitting 
              the vasculoid surface: (1) to slightly expand or contract in area, 
              or (2) to flex, either in response to macroscale body movements 
              or in response to vascular surface corrugations or other irregularities 
              to the same degree or better than the natural endothelium.</p>
<p>Thus, plated surfaces readily accommodate the natural cyclical 
              volume changes of various organs such as lung, bladder, or spleen. 
              Rigidity of the plate array is also subject to <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering control 
              and to localized real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> control as well, via the bumpers; diamondoid 
              or sapphire plating may be made substantially stiffer than natural 
              endothelium, if desired.</p>
<p>Installation of the vasculoid involves complete exsanguination 
              of a sedated patient, replacement of the natural circulatory fluid 
              with various installation fluids, followed by mechanical vascular 
              plating, defluidization, and finally activation of the vasculoid. 
              Installation takes ~6.5 hours from start to finish and requires 
              a peak ~200-watt power draw midway through the procedure. (By comparison, 
              present-day kidney dialysis treatments require 4-12 hours and the 
              equipment also draws a few hundred watts.) The hypothetical installation 
              protocol was selected for maximum comfort, reversibility, and reliability 
              according to contemporary medical standards.</p>
<p>The advantages of installing a vasculoid are potentially numerous. 
              Many of these benefits theoretically could be provided on a temporary 
              or more limited basis using terabot-dose injections of considerably 
              less aggressive bloodborne nanomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. However, the vasculoid 
              appliance simultaneously provides all benefits on an essentially 
              permanent and whole-body basis. Additionally, some benefits appear 
              unique to the vasculoid and can be achieved in no other way.</p>
<p>Whether the entire package is sufficiently attractive to warrant 
              installation will probably be a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of personal taste rather 
              than of medical necessity, since a molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> capable 
              of building and deploying a complex vasculoid is likely to offer 
              complete non-vasculoid cures for most circulatory and blood-related 
              disorders that plague humanity today, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> enhancements 
              may also be available. And in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>, moving from an <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that works alongside a natural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> (e.g., respirocytes 
              [5]) to an <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that entirely replaces a natural 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> (e.g., vasculoid [3]) may involve significant safety, psychological, 
              and even ethical considerations.</p>
<p>The most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant benefits of vasculoid installation may include:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Exclusion of parasites, <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, viruses, and metastasizing 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells from the bloodflow, thus limiting the spread of bloodborne 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. Such microorganisms and cells are easily eliminated from 
                the blood using ~cm<sup>3</sup> doses of appropriately <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med 
                nanobiotics [1, 4], but such <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> nanorobotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s might 
                not normally be deployed on a permanent basis. Intracellular <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s 
                that can infect motile phagocytic cells (e.g., the tuberculosis 
                <i>Mycobacterium</i> or the bacterium <i>Listeria</i>, both of 
                which can reside inside macrophages [9]) cannot be directly excluded 
                from the tissues when infected cells are transported by the vasculoid. 
                <br>
<br>
                However, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> surface markers will often reveal such infection, 
                so vasculoid <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can check for the presence of such markers 
                and thus deny these cells re-entry to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tissues. <br>
<br>
                For example, the membrane surface of macrophages infected by <i>Mycobacterium 
                microti</i> is antigenically different from that of uninfected 
                macrophages [10]; <i>Listeria</i>-derived peptides are found acting 
                as integral membrane <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s in the plasma membrane of infected 
                macrophages [11], and other <i>Listeria</i>-infected antigen-presenting 
                cells display hsp60 on their plasma membranes only when infected 
                [12].</li>
<br>
<li>Faster and more reliable trafficking of lymphocytes throughout 
                the secondary lymphoid organs, allowing them to survey for targeted 
                antigens in minutes or hours, rather than days (because both white 
                cells and antigenic sources can be efficiently concentrated), 
                thus greatly speeding the natural <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> response to foreign 
                antigen. This lymphocyte function might also be augmented or replaced 
                using <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> histomobile medical nanorobots [1] or biorobots.<br>
<br>
                If biorobots are developed first, many vasculoid installations 
                might take place in patients possessing largely artificial immune 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, thus obviating the need for much of the cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> 
                trafficking that would otherwise be mediated by boxcars and cellulocks.</li>
<br>
<li>Eradication of most serious circulatory-related pathological 
                conditions including all vascular <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> (e.g., aortic dissection, 
                vessel blockages, spasms, aneurysms, phlebitis, varicose veins), 
                heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, syncope (including orthostatic hypotension) and 
                shock, stroke, and bleeding, due to the elimination of unconstrained 
                metabolite and fluid circulation.<br>
<br>
                Certain other conditions due to localized prevention of blood 
                flow such as bedsores and subclinical paresthesias (e.g., "pins-and-needles" 
                sensation) can also be ameliorated, since stiffened blood vessels 
                will not be nearly so easy to close via external compression.<br>
<br>
                Again, many of these conditions may already have adequate nanomedical 
                treatments by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the vasculoid can be built, but other conditions 
                might not yet be readily or as conveniently treatable, such as 
                the dangers of large-scale bleeding (both internal and external).</li>
<br>
<li>Reduced susceptibility to chemical, biochemical, and parasitic 
                poisons of all kinds, including allergenic substances in food, 
                air and water, although bloodborne nanotankers or pharmacytes 
                [1] may be able to partially duplicate this function as well.</li>
<br>
<li>Faster metabolite transport and distribution, significantly 
                improving physical endurance and stamina, including the ability 
                to breathe at low O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures and the ability 
                to flush out unwanted specific biochemicals from the body (a feature 
                which might be duplicated using bloodborne respirocyte-class <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s 
                [1, 5]). The <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> would also permit convenient long-term 
                storage of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, or amino acid recovery and recycling, which 
                could prove nutritionally useful.</li>
<br>
<li>Direct, rapid user control of many hormonal- and neurochemical-mediated, 
                and all blood-mediated, physiological responses. It would be difficult 
                (though not impossible) to provide equivalent comprehensive whole-body 
                physiological control using <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> micron-scale bloodborne 
                nanorobots alone.</li>
<br>
<li>Voluntary control of capillary conductance and rigidity permitting 
                conscious regulation of thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> exchange with the environment 
                and at least limited control of whole-body morphological <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, 
                rigidity (e.g., stiffness, bending modulus, etc.), and volume 
                with ~millisecond response times.</li>
<br>
<li>At least partial protection from various accidents and other 
                physical harm such as <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> stings, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> bites, collisions, 
                bullet or shrapnel penetrations, or falling from heights. This 
                is perhaps the only specific benefit of the vasculoid appliance 
                that could not be achieved by any less radical means: extreme 
                trauma resistance, especially resistance to exsanguination and 
                cushioning against mechanical shock.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<p>Medically oriented readers might properly wonder why anyone would 
              want to discuss replacing a perfectly functional natural fluid transport 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with an untested, complex, artificial, dry <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with which 
              humans have no <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> today. There are several answers to this 
              very good question.</p>
<p>First of all, medical skeptics should bear in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that the vasculoid 
              appliance is clearly a highly sophisticated medical nanosystem. 
              It cannot be built without using a manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> based on 
              a mature molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. Its use would come only after 
              many decades of previous <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in building, testing, 
              and operating such highly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>-rich milieu in which it would be deployed, 
              the vasculoid as a medical intervention may be closer to the typical 
              than to the extreme (as it might appear today). It is as if we were 
              looking forward from the limited vantage point of the 1950s &#8212; 
              a technological era in which <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s still reigned supreme 
              &#8212; to the year 2002, and estimating the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> feasibility of 
              a 1 GHz Pentium III laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (a feat of prognostication actually 
              achieved by <a class="thought" href="entries/clarke_entry.html">Arthur C. Clarke</a> [13]).</p>
<p>In the nanomedical era, it will be a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of personal preference 
              and choice for each patient, in consultation with their physician, 
              whether the aforementioned benefits of the vasculoid appliance are 
              worth the risks. The <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> described in this article would represent 
              a most extreme intervention using a very advanced medical molecular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>The technical paper [3] concludes: "Ultimately, and from the standpoint 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-guided <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, the body exists primarily to ensure the 
              survival of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> &#8212; not the replication of the genes, which 
              was the ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> [14, 15]. It would seem that a somewhat 
              more advanced and compact version of the proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> could function 
              independently of nearly all noncortical tissue. Thus the vasculoid 
              is most fascinating because it may represent one last outpost of 
              humanity at the final frontier of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>."</p>

            The idea of the vasculoid originated in the asking of a simple question: 
            Once a mature molecular nanotechnology becomes available, could we

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Left unexplored in this article is that once nanobot technology reached the point of replacing the vascular system, it is likely that the replacement process wouldn't stop there. It is likely there would be hundreds if not thousands of individual nanobots each with their own capabilities. These would be replicated in the trillions to replace or extend various bodily functions. The introduction and replication of each individual nanobot might occur in successive steps with the full augmentation occurring gradually in the evolving cyborg. Eventually, there would be a vast variety of cyborgs each with various combinations of augmentation.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I&#8217;m visualizing something like a Buckytube supplement to the extra cellular matrix that could be generated via the proposed vasculoid. It would extend throughout the body and make it almost impervious to injury. We would be &#8220;bulletproof&#8221;. 
<br>
<br>
This combined system could be used to quickly transport materials too and from the surface of the body, so that a person could quickly form a protective outer coating for use in hard vacuum, or extreme temperatures. Probably, mechanical supplements that permitted flight or other odd adaptations would be possible. 
<br>
<br>
A person with such a system would be able to live in ways that few have ever considered. They would not need houses and possibly would not need to ingest prepared proteins. They could live out of doors, sleep safely and comfortably in the open, and manufacture nutrition out of wood and vegetation. If they wanted to leave the earth, they could sprout wings and rockets, grow a thick protective shell, and fly off into space. Most likely, once they entered space, they could manufacture needed materials using solar radiation and whatever else is available. Obviously, the vasculoid would only be the first step in a rapid evolution.
<br>
<br>
The proposed vasculoid is really just more evidence of the inevitable technological singularity. No matter how you manipulate the equation, you arrive at the same result.
