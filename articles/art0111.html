<p>VIRUS: A small replicator consisting of little but a package of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> which, when injected into a host <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, can direct the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to make more viruses.</p>
<p>&#160;<b>ZERO SUM</b>: A term used to describe a situation in which one <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> can gain only if other entities suffer an equal loss; for example, a private poker game. (See Positive Sum.)</p>
