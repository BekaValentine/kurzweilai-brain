<div class="TeaserText">In the early 1980s, MIT professor Sherry Turkle first called the computer a "second self." With this essay, she presents a major new theory of "evocative objects": Wearable computers, PDAs, online multiple identities, "companion species" (such as quasi-alive virtual pets, digital dolls, and robot nurses for the elderly), "affective computing" devices (such as the human-like Kismet robot), and the imminent age of machines designed as relational artifacts are causing us to see ourselves and our world differently. They call for a new generation of psychoanalytic self-psychology to explore the human response and the human vulnerability to these objects. </div>

<h3>I. Psychoanalytic Culture and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Culture</h3>
<p>Over twenty years ago, as a new faculty member at MIT, I taught 
              an introductory class on psychoanalytic theory. For one meeting, 
              early in the semester, I had assigned Freud's chapters on slips 
              of the tongue from The Psychopathology of Everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. I began 
              class by reviewing Freud's first example: the chairman of a parliamentary 
              session begins the meeting by declaring it closed<sup>1</sup>. </p>
<p>Freud's analysis centered on the possible <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s behind the chairman's 
              slip: he might be anxious about what the parliamentarians had on 
              their agenda. Freud's analysis turned on trying to uncover the hidden 
              meaning behind the chairman's remark. The theoretical effort was 
              to understand his mixed <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, his unconscious ambivalence. </p>
<p>As I was talking to my class about the Freudian notions of the 
              unconscious and of ambivalence, one of the students, an undergraduate 
              majoring in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>, raised her hand to <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>. She was 
              studying at the MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory, which was 
              (and is) a place whose goal, in the words of one of its founders, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, is to create "machines that did things that 
              would be considered intelligent if done by people. Work in the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> 
              Lab began with the assumption that the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, in Minsky's terms, 
              "was a meat <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>," best understood by <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>izing its 
              working to that of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. It was from this perspective 
              that my student <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ed to what she considered a tortured explanation 
              for slips of the tongue. </p>
<p>"In a Freudian dictionary," she began, "closed and 
              open are far apart. In a Webster's dictionary," she continued, 
              "they are as far apart as the listings for <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> and the listings 
              for O. But in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al dictionary -- such as we have in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> -- closed and open are designated by the same <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>, 
              separated by a sign of opposition. Closed equals 'minus' open. To 
              substitute closed for open does not require the notion of ambivalence 
              or conflict. When the substitution is made, a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> has been dropped. 
              A minus sign has been lost. There has been a power surge. No problem."</p>
<p>With this brief comment, a Freudian slip had been transformed into 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing error. An explanation in terms of meaning 
              had been replaced by a narrative of mechanistic causation. At the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, that transition from meaning to mechanism struck me as emblematic 
              of a larger movement that might be taking place in psychological 
              culture. Were we moving from a psychoanalytic to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture, 
              one that would not need such notions as ambivalence when it modeled 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a><sup>2</sup>? </p>
<p>For me, that 1981 class was a turning point. The story of the relationship 
              between the psychoanalytic and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> cultures moved to the center 
              of my intellectual concerns. But the story of their relationship 
              has been far more complex than the narrative of simple transition 
              that suggested itself to me during the early 1980s. Here I shall 
              argue the renewed relevance of a psychoanalytic discourse in <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              culture. Indeed, I shall argue that this relevance is so profound 
              as to suggest an occasion for a revitalization and renewal of psychoanalytic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>In my view, this contemporary relevance does not follow, as some 
              might expect, from efforts to link psychoanalysis and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally-inspired 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a>. Nor does it follow, as I once believed it would, from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> and psychoanalysis finding structural or 
              behavioral <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ies in their respective <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s of study. </p>
<p>In my 1988, "Psychoanalysis and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>: A 
              New Alliance<sup>3</sup>," I suggested an opening for dialogue between 
              these two traditions that had previously eyed each other with suspicion 
              if not contempt. In my view, the opening occurred because of the 
              ascendance of "connectionist" models of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. 
              Connectionist descriptions of how <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> was "emergent" 
              from the interactions of agents had significant resonance with the 
              way psychoanalytic <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>-relations theory talked about <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              in a dynamic inner landscape. Both seemed to be describing what 
              Minsky would have called a "society of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>." </p>
<p>Today, however, the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s within the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture that speak 
              most directly to psychoanalysis are concrete rather than theoretical. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">Novel</a> and evocative <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s demand a depth <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> 
              of our relationships with them. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture needs psychoanalytic 
              understandings to adequately confront our evolving relationships 
              with a new world of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. Psychoanalysis needs to understand 
              the influence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s on the terrain it knows best: 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> and specificity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> subject.</p>
<h3>II. Evocative <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">Object</a>s and Psychoanalytic Theory</h3>
<p>The designers of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s have traditionally focused 
              on how these <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s might extend and/or perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive 
              powers. As an ethnographer/psychologist of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture, I hear 
              another narrative as well: that of the users. Designers have traditionally 
              focused on the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that does things 
              for us. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> users are frequently more in touch with the subjective 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that does things to us, to our ways of seeing 
              the world, to the way we think, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of our relationships 
              with each other. Technologies are never "just tools." 
              They are evocative <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. They cause us to see ourselves and our 
              world differently.</p>
<p>While designers have focused on how <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s such 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/pda_entry.html">personal digital assistant</a>s will help people better manage their 
              complex lives, users have seen <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s such as a Palm Pilot as extensions 
              of self. The designer says: "People haven't evolved to keep 
              up with <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s will help." The user says: "When 
              my Palm crashed it was like a <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. More than I could handle. I 
              had lost my <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>." </p>
<p>Wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that enable the user to have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              and online <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, connected to the Web by a small 
              radio transmitter and using specially designed eyeglasses as a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              monitor. Designers of wearable computing talk about new and indeed, 
              superhuman <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. For example, with a wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              you can be in a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> with a faculty colleague and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ing 
              his or her most recent papers at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>But when people actually wear <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (and in this 
              case, this sometimes happens when the designers begin to use and 
              live with the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>) they testify to impacts on a very different 
              register: wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s change one's <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of self. One user 
              says, "I become my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. It's not just that I remember 
              people or know more about them. I feel invincible, sociable, better 
              prepared. I am naked without it. With it, I'm a better person." 
              A wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is lived as a glass through which we see, however 
              darkly, our <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a><sup>4</sup>. Indeed, the group of students at MIT 
              who have pioneered the use of wearable computing call themselves 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a>s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> proceeds through a discourse of rationality. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> culture grows familiar with the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s of passion, 
              dependency, and profound connection with <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>. Contemporary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s are increasingly intimate <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s; they demand 
              that we focus our attention on the significance of our increasingly 
              intimate relationships with them. This is where psychoanalytic studies 
              are called for. We need a developmental and psychodynamic approach 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that focuses on our new <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> relations. <br>
<br>
              There is a certain irony in this suggestion, for of course psychoanalysis 
              has its own "object-relations" tradition<sup>5</sup>. Freud's "Mourning 
              and Melancholia" opened psychoanalysis to <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about how 
              people take lost <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s and internalize them, creating new psychic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> along with new facets of personality and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a><sup>6</sup>. But 
              for psychoanalysis, the "objects" in question were people. 
              A small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of psychoanalytic thinkers writers explored the power 
              of the inanimate (for example, D. W. Winnicott and Erik Erikson, 
              child analysts who wrote about the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s in children's 
              play), but, in general, the story of "object relations" 
              in psychoanalysis has cast people in the role of "objects." 
            </p>
<p>Today, the new <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s of our lives call upon psychoanalytic theory 
              to create an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> relations theory that really is about <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              in the everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the word. </p>
<p>What are these new <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s? When in the early 1980s I first called 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> a "second self" or a Rorschach, an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> 
              for the projection of personhood, relationships with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              were usually one-to-one, a person alone with a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. This is 
              no longer the case. A rapidly expanding <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, collectively 
              known as the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, links millions of people together in new 
              spaces that are changing the way we think, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of our sexuality, 
              the form of our communities, our very identities. A <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of relationships 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> challenges what we have traditionally called "identity." 
            </p>
<p>Most recently, a new kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> has appeared 
              on the scene. "Relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s," such as robotic 
              pets and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> creatures, are explicitly designed to have emotive, 
              affect-laden connections with people. Today's <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              do not wait for children to "animate" them in the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> 
              of a Raggedy Anne doll or the Velveteen Rabbit, the toy who finally 
              became alive because so many children had loved him. They present 
              themselves as already animated and ready for relationship. People 
              are not imagined as their "users" but as their companions.</p>
<p>At MIT, a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> group on "affective computing" works 
              on the assumption that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will not be able to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> without sociability and affect. The mission of the 
              affective computing group is to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that are <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med 
              to assess their users' <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al states and respond with <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al 
              states of their own. In the case of the robotic doll and the affective 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, we are confronted with relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s that demand 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> users attend to the <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>Today's relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s include <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> dogs and cats, some 
              specially designed and marketed to lonely elders. There is also 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> infant doll that makes baby sounds and even baby facial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s, shaped by mechanical musculature under artificial skin. 
              This <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally complex doll has baby "states of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>." 
              Bounce the doll when it is happy, and it gets happier. Bounce it 
              when it is grumpy and it gets grumpier. </p>
<p>These relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s provide good examples of how psychoanalysis 
              might productively revisit old "object" theories in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> 
              of new "object" relations. Consider whether relational 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s could ever be "transitional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s" in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of a baby blanket or rag doll. For Winnicott, such <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              (to which children remain attached even as they embark on the exploration 
              of the world beyond the nursery) are mediators between the child's 
              earliest bonds with the mother, whom the infant <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s as inseparable 
              from the self, and the child's growing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to develop relationships 
              with other people who will be <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d as separate beings. </p>
<p>The infant knows transitional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s as both almost-inseparable 
              parts of the self and, at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, as the first not-me possessions. 
              As the child grows, the actual <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s are left behind. The abiding 
              effects of early encounters with them, however, are manifest in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of a highly-charged intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> between the 
              self and certain <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s in later <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. This <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> has traditionally 
              been associated with <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>, 
              sexual intimacy, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of connection with <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. In recent 
              years, the power of the transitional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> is commonly seen in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>Just as musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s can be extensions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>'s construction 
              of sound, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can be extensions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>'s construction 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. A novelist refers to "my ESP with the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. 
              The words float out. I share the screen with my words." An 
              architect who uses the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to design goes even further: "I 
              don't see the building in my <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> until I start to play with shapes 
              and forms on the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. It comes to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> between 
              my eyes and the screen." Musicians often hear the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> in 
              their minds before they play it, experiencing the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> from within 
              before they <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> it from without. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> similarly can 
              be <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d as an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> on the border between self and not-self.</p>
<p>In the past, the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s to play this transitional role 
              has been tied to the ways in which they enabled the child to project 
              meanings onto them. The doll or the teddy bear presented an unchanging 
              and passive presence. In the past, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were also targets of 
              projection; the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> functioned as a Rorschach or "second 
              self." </p>
<p>But today's relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s take a decidedly more active stance. 
              With them, children's expectations that their dolls want to be hugged, 
              dressed, or lulled to sleep don't only come from the child's projection 
              of fantasy or desire onto inert playthings, but from such things 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> dolls' crying inconsolably or even saying: "Hug 
              me!" or "It's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for me to get dressed for school!" 
            </p>
<p>In a similar vein, consider how these <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s look from the perspective 
              of self <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>. Heinz Kohut describes how some people may shore 
              up their fragile <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of self by turning another person into a 
              "self <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>." In the role of self <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, the other is 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d as part of the self, thus in perfect tune with the fragile 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>'s inner state. Disappointments inevitably follow. </p>
<p>Relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s (not as they exist now but as their designers 
              promise they will soon be) clearly present themselves as candidates 
              for such a role. If they can give the appearance of aliveness and 
              yet not disappoint, they may even have a comparative advantage over 
              people, and open new possibilities for narcissistic <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. One might even say that when people turn other people 
              into self-<a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, they are making an effort to turn a person into 
              a kind of "spare part." From this point of view, relational 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s make a certain amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> as successors to the always-resistant 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> material. </p>
<p>Just as television today is a background actor in family relationships 
              and a "stabilizer" of mood and affect for <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s 
              in their homes, in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> a range of robotic companions 
              and a web of pervasive <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s will mediate a new 
              generation's psychological and social lives. We will be living in 
              a relational soup of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> that offers itself as a self-ether 
              if not as a self-<a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>. Your home <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              "agents" <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med into it, indeed the computing embedded 
              in your furniture and your clothing, will know your <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s, your 
              preferences, your habits, and your physiological responses to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al 
              stimuli. </p>
<p>A new generation of psychoanalytic self-<a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> is called upon 
              to explore the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> response and the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> vulnerability to these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s.</p>
<h3>III. Personal Computing: One-on-One With the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> </h3>
<p>Each modality of being with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, one-on-one with the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, 
              using the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/gateway_entry.html">gateway</a> to other people, and being presented 
              with it as a relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>, implies a distinct mode of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> 
              relations. Each challenges psychoanalytic <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in a somewhat 
              different way. And all of these challenges face us at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. 
              The development of relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s does not mean that we don't 
              also continue to spend a great deal of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> alone, one-on-one with 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s.</p>
<p>Being alone with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be compelling for many different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. For some, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> offers the promise of perfection, 
              the fantasy that "If you do it right, it will do it right, 
              and right away." Writers can become obsessed with fonts, layout, 
              spelling and <a class="thought" href="entries/grammar_entry.html">grammar</a> checks. What was once a typographical error 
              can be, like Hester Prynne's Scarlet Letter, a sign of shame. As 
              one writer put it: "A typographical error is the sign not of 
              carelessness but of sloth and disregard for others, the sign that 
              you couldn't take the one extra second, the one keystroke, to make 
              it right." Like the anorectic projecting self worth onto his 
              or her body and <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a> consumption, and who endeavors to eat ten 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a>s less each day, game players or <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers may try to get 
              to one more screen or play ten minutes more each day when dealing 
              with the perfectible <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al material. </p>
<p>Thus, the promise of perfection is at the heart of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s 
              holding power for some. Others are drawn by different sirens. As 
              we have seen, there is much seduction in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> is building <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> or even merging with the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of another being. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can seem to be a second self, a metaphor first suggested 
              to me by a thirteen-year-old girl who said, "When you <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> there is a little piece of your <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, and now it's a 
              little piece of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. And now you can see it." 
              An investment counselor in her mid-forties echoes the child's sentiment 
              when she says of her laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>: "I <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> the way it has 
              my whole <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on it." If one is afraid of intimacy yet afraid 
              of being alone, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> offers an apparent solution: the illusion 
              of companionship without the demands of friendship. In the mirror 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, one can be a loner yet never be alone. </p>
<h3>IV. Lives on the Screen: Relating Person-to-Person via <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a></h3>
<p>From the mid-1980s, the cultural image of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> use expanded 
              from an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> alone with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> engaged 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of relationships via the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> became 
              a powerful evocative <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> for rethinking <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, one that encourages 
              people to recast their <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of self in terms of multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> 
              and parallel lives.</p>
<p>Virtual personae. In <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, as is well known, the body is 
              represented by one's own textual description, so the obese can be 
              slender, the beautiful plain. The fact that self-presentation is 
              written in text means that there is <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to reflect upon and edit 
              one's "composition" which makes it easier for the shy 
              to be outgoing, the "nerdy" sophisticated. The relative 
              anonymity of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on the screen -- one has the choice of being known 
              only by one's chosen "handle" or online name -- gives 
              people the chance to express often unexplored aspects of the self. 
              Additionally, multiple aspects of self can be explored in parallel. 
              Online services offer their users the opportunity to be known by 
              several different names. For example, it is not unusual for someone 
              to be BroncoBill in one online <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, ArmaniBoy in another, and 
              MrSensitive in a third. </p>
<p>The online exercise of playing with <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> and trying out new 
              ones is perhaps most explicit in "role playing" virtual 
              communities and online <a class="thought" href="entries/gaming_entry.html">gaming</a> where participation literally begins 
              with the creation of a persona (or several), but it is by no means 
              confined to these somewhat exotic locales. In bulletin boards, newsgroups, 
              and chatrooms, the creation of personae may be less explicit than 
              in virtual worlds or games, but it is no less psychologically real. 
              One <a class="thought" href="entries/irc_entry.html">IRC</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/irc_entry.html">Internet Relay Chat</a>) participant describes her <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              of online talk: "I go from channel to channel depending on 
              my mood &#8230;. I actually feel a part of several of the channels, 
              several <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s.... I'm different in the different chats. 
              They bring out different things in me." <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">Identity</a> play can happen 
              by changing names and by changing places. </p>
<p>Even the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> encourages rethinking complex <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> 
              issues. The development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> metaphor for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s 
              was a technical innovation motivated by the desire to get people 
              working more efficiently by "cycling through" different 
              applications much as <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-sharing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s cycled through the computing 
              needs of different people. But in practice, <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> have become 
              a potent metaphor for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the self as a multiple, distributed, 
              "time-sharing" <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The self is no longer simply playing 
              different roles in different settings, something that people <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              when, for example, one wakes up as a lover, makes breakfast as a 
              mother, and drives to work as a lawyer. The <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> metaphor perhaps 
              merely suggests a distributed self that exists in many worlds and 
              plays many roles at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">Cyberspace</a>, however, translates 
              that metaphor into a lived <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of "cycling through."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">Identity</a>, Moratoria and Play. For some people, <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> is a 
              place to "act out" unresolved conflicts, to play and replay 
              characterological difficulties on a new and exotic stage. For others, 
              it provides an opportunity to "work through" significant 
              personal issues, to use the new materials of cybersociality to reach 
              for new resolutions. These more positive <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>-effects follow 
              from the fact that for some, <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> provides what Erik Erikson 
              would have called a "psychosocial moratorium," a central 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> in how Erikson <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> development in adolescence. 
            </p>
<p>Although the term "moratorium" implies a "time out," 
              what Erikson had in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> was not withdrawal. On the contrary, the 
              adolescent moratorium is a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of intense interaction with people 
              and ideas. It is a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of passionate friendships and <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation. 
              The adolescent falls in and out of <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> with people and ideas. Erikson's 
              notion of the moratorium was not a "hold" on significant 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s but on their consequences. It is a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> during which 
              one's <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s are in a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, not counted as they will be 
              later in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. They are not given as much weight, not given the 
              force of full judgment. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation can become 
              the norm rather than a brave departure. Relatively consequence-free 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation facilitates the development of a "core self," 
              a personal <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of what gives <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> meaning that Erikson called 
              "identity."</p>
<p>Erikson developed these ideas about the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of a moratorium 
              during the late 1950s and early 1960s. At that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the notion 
              corresponded to a common understanding of what "the college 
              years" were about. Today, thirty years later, the idea of the 
              college years as a consequence-free "time out" seems of 
              another era. College is pre-professional and AIDS has made consequence-free 
              sexual <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation an impossibility. The years associated with 
              adolescence no longer seem a "time out." But if our culture 
              no longer offers an adolescent moratorium, virtual communities often 
              do. It is part of what makes them seem so attractive.</p>
<p>Erikson's ideas about stages did not suggest rigid sequences. His 
              stages describe what people need to achieve before they can easily 
              move ahead to another developmental task. For example, Erikson pointed 
              out that successful intimacy in young adulthood is difficult if 
              one does not come to it with a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of who one is, the challenge 
              of adolescent <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> building. In real <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, however, people frequently 
              move on with serious deficits. With incompletely resolved "stages," 
              they simply do the best they can. They use whatever materials they 
              have at hand to get as much as they can of what they have missed. 
              Now virtual social <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> can play a role in these dramas of self-reparation. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> reworks the notion of the moratorium because 
              it may now exist on an always-available "window." Analysts 
              need to note, respect and interpret their patients' "life on 
              the screen."</p>
<p>Having literally written our online personae into <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>, they 
              can be a kind of Rorschach. We can use them to become more aware 
              of what we project into everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. We can use the virtual to 
              reflect constructively on the real. <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">Cyberspace</a> opens the possibility 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> play, but it is very serious play. People who cultivate 
              an awareness of what stands behind their screen personae are the 
              ones most likely to succeed in using virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> for personal 
              and social transformation. And the people who make the most of their 
              lives on the screen are those who are capable of approaching it 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of self-reflection. What does my behavior in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> 
              tell me about what I want, who I am, what I may not be getting in 
              the rest of my life? </p>
<p>"Case" is a 34-year-old industrial designer happily married 
              to a <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> co-worker. Case describes his RL persona as a "nice 
              guy," a "Jimmy Stewart type like my father." He describes 
              his outgoing, assertive mother as a "Katherine Hepburn type." 
              For Case, who views assertiveness through the prism of this Jimmy 
              Stewart/Katherine Hepburn dichotomy, an assertive man is quickly 
              perceived as "being a bastard." An assertive woman, in 
              contrast, is perceived as being "modern and together." 
              Case says that although he is comfortable with his temperament and 
              loves and respects his father, he feels he pays a high price for 
              his low-key ways. In particular, he feels at a loss when it comes 
              to confrontation, both at home and at work. Online, in a wide range 
              of virtual communities, Case presents himself as <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a>s to whom 
              he refers as his "Katherine Hepburn types." These are 
              strong, dynamic, "out there" women. They remind Case of 
              his mother, who "says exactly what's on her <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>." He 
              tells me that presenting himself as a woman online has brought him 
              to a point where he is more comfortable with confrontation in his 
              RL as a man. </p>
<p>Additionally, Case has used <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> to develop a new model for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about his <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. He thinks of his Katherine Hepburn personae 
              as various "aspects of the self." His online <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> reminds 
              him of how Hindu gods could have different aspects or sub-personalities, 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s, all the while being a whole self.</p>
<p>Case's inner landscape is very different from those of a person 
              with multiple personality disorder. Case's inner actors are not 
              split off from each other or his <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of "himself." He 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s himself very much as a collective whole, not feeling 
              that he must goad or repress this or that aspect of himself into 
              conformity. He is at ease, cycling through from Katherine Hepburn 
              to Jimmy Stewart. To use the psychoanalyst Philip Bromberg's <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, 
              online <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has helped Case learn how to "stand in the spaces 
              between selves and still feel one, to see the multiplicity and still 
              feel a unity." To use the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>'s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, Case feels at ease cycling through his "society of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>," a notion of <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> as distributed and heterogeneous. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">Identity</a>, from the Latin idem, has been typically used to refer 
              to the sameness between two qualities. On the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, however, 
              one can be many and usually is. </p>

              <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> can be expressed "live" on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen as 
              Kurzweil performs "her" and as an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              on Kurzweil's web site. </p>
<p>Theory and <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s-to-think-with. The notions of <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> and multiplicity 
              to which I was exposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s originated 
              within the continental psychoanalytic tradition. These notions, 
              most notably that there is no such thing as "the ego" 
              -- that each of us is a multiplicity of parts, fragments, and desiring 
              connections -- grew in the intellectual hothouse of Paris; they 
              presented the world according to such authors as Jacques Lacan, 
              Gilles Deleuze, and F&#233;lix Guattari. I met these ideas and 
              their authors as a student in Paris, but despite such ideal conditions 
              for absorbing theory, my "French lessons" remained abstract 
              exercises. These theorists of postructuralism spoke words that addressed 
              the relationship between <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> and body, but from my point of view 
              had little to do with my own.</p>
<p>In my lack of personal connection with these ideas, I was not alone. 
              To take one example, for many people it is hard to accept any challenge 
              to the idea of an autonomous ego. While in recent years, many psychologists, 
              social theorists, psychoanalysts, and philosophers have argued that 
              the self should be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as essentially decentered, the normal 
              requirements of everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> exert strong pressure on people to 
              take responsibility for their <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s and to see themselves as unitary 
              actors. This disjuncture between theory (the unitary self is an 
              illusion) and lived <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> (the unitary self is the most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>) is one of the main <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s why multiple and decentered 
              theories have been slow to catch on -- or when they do, why we tend 
              to settle back quickly into older, centralized ways of looking at 
              things.</p>
<p>When twenty years later, I first used my <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> and 
              modem to join online communities, I had an <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of this theoretical 
              perspective that brought it shockingly down to <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. I used <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> 
              to create several characters. My <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s were textual -- my words 
              made things happen. I created selves that were made of and transformed 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. And in each of these different personae, I was exploring 
              different aspects of my self. The notion of a decentered <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> 
              was concretized by <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen. In this way, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> became an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> to think with for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>. 
              In <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> was fluid and multiple, a signifier no longer 
              clearly points to a thing that is signified, and understanding is 
              less likely to proceed through analysis than by navigation through 
              virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>.</p>
<p><br>
              Appropriable theories, ideas that capture the <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a> of the 
              culture at large, tend to be those with which people can become 
              actively involved. They tend to be theories that can be "played" 
              with. So one way to think about the social appropriability of a 
              given theory is to ask whether it is accompanied by its own <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s-to-think-with 
              that can help it move out beyond intellectual circles.</p>
<p> For example, the popular appropriation of Freudian theory had 
              little to do with scientific demonstrations of its validity. Freudian 
              theory passed into the popular culture because they offered robust 
              and down-to-<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s-to-think-with. The <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s were not physical 
              but almost-tangible ideas such as dreams and slips of the tongue. 
              People were able to play with such Freudian "objects." 
              They became used to looking for them and manipulating them, both 
              seriously and not so seriously. And as they did so, the idea that 
              slips and dreams betray an unconscious started to feel natural.</p>
<p>In Freud's work, dreams and slips of the tongue carried the theory. 
              Today, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen carries theory. People decide 
              that they want to interact with others on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. They 
              get an account on a <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> service. They think that this will 
              provide them with new <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to people and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and of course 
              it does. </p>
<p>But it does more. When they log on, they may find themselves playing 
              multiple roles; they may find themselves playing characters of the 
              opposite <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a>. In this way they are swept up by <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s that 
              enable them to explore previously unexamined aspects of their sexuality 
              or that challenge their ideas about a unitary self. The <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that does things for us has another side. 
              It is also a subjective <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that does things to us -- to our 
              view of our relationships, to our ways of looking at our minds and 
              ourselves</p>
<p> Within the psychoanalytic tradition, many "schools" 
              have departed from a unitary view of <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, among these the Jungian, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>-relations, and Lacanian. In different ways, each of these 
              groups of analysts was banished from the ranks of orthodox Freudians 
              for such suggestions, or somehow relegated to the margins. As America 
              became the center of psychoanalytic <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> in the mid-twentieth 
              century, ideas about a robust executive ego moved into the psychoanalytic 
              mainstream.</p>
            These days, the pendulum has swung away from any complacent view of 
            a unitary self. Through the fragmented selves presented by patients 
            and through theories that stress the decentered subject, contemporary 
            social and psychological thinkers are confronting what has been left 
            out of theories of the unitary self. Online <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s with "parallel 
            lives" are part of the significant cultural <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> that supports 
            new ways of theorizing about non-pathological, indeed healthy, multiple 
            selves.<br>

              build a <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> boy, David, who is <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>. David 
              expresses this <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> to a woman who has adopted him as her child. 
              In the discussion that followed the release of the film, emphasis 
              usually fell on the question whether such a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> could really be 
              developed. People thereby passed over a deeper question, one that 
              historically has contributed to our fascination with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s 
              burgeoning capabilities. That question concerns not what <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              can do or what <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will be like in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, but rather, 
              what we will be like. What kinds of people are we becoming as we 
              develop more and more intimate relationships with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s?</p>
<p>In this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, the pressing issue in A.I. is not the potential 
              "reality" of a non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> son, but rather that faced 
              by his adoptive mother -- a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> woman whose response to a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that asks for her nurturance is the desire to nurture it; 
              whose response to a non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> creature who reaches out to her 
              is to feel attachment, horror, <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, and confusion.</p>
<p>The questions faced by the mother in A.I. include "What kind 
              of relationship is it appropriate, desirable, imaginable to have 
              with a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>?" and "What is a relationship?" Although 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> has not come close to creating 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> such as Spielberg's David, these questions have become current, 
              even urgent.</p>
<p>Today, we are faced with relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s to which people respond 
              in ways that have much in common with the mother in A.I. These <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s 
              are not perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> replicas as was David, but they are able to 
              push certain <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al buttons (think of them perhaps as <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              buttons). When a robotic creature makes eye contact, follows your 
              gaze, and gestures towards you, you are provoked to respond to that 
              creature as a <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> and even caring other. Psychoanalytic <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              offers materials that can deepen our understanding of what we feel 
              when we confront a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> child who asks us for <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>. It can help 
              us explore what moral stance we might take if we choose to pursue 
              such relationships. </p>
<p>There is every indication that the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              will include relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s that have feelings, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycles, 
              moods, that reminisce, and have a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a> -- that say they 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> us, and expect us to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> them back. What will it mean to a 
              person when their primary daily companion is a robotic dog? Or their 
              health care "attendant" is built in the form of a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> 
              cat? Or their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> attends to their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al states 
              and, in turn, has affective states of its own? In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to study 
              these questions I have embarked on a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> project that includes 
              fieldwork in <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> laboratories, among children playing with 
              virtual pets and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> dolls, and among the elderly to whom robotic 
              companions are starting to be aggressively marketed.</p>
<p>I have noted that in the over two decades in which I have explored 
              people's relationships with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, I have used the metaphor 
              of the Rorschach, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as a screen on which people projected 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and feelings, their very different cognitive styles. 
              With relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s, the Rorschach model of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              relationship breaks down. People are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to interact with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> and gesture; people are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> that to relate 
              successfully to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> you have to assess its <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al "state." 
            </p>
<p>In my previous <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on children and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> toys, children 
              described the lifelike status of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in terms of their cognitive 
              capacities (the toys could "know" things, "solve" 
              puzzles). In my studies on children and Furbies, I found that children 
              describe these new toys as "sort of alive" because of 
              the quality of their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al attachments to the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s and because 
              of the idea that the Furby might be <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>ally attached to them. 
              So, for example, when I ask the question, "Do you think the 
              Furby is alive?" children answer not in terms of what the Furby 
              can do, but how they feel about the Furby and how the Furby might 
              feel about them.</p>
<p>Ron (6): Well, the Furby is alive for a Furby. And you know, something 
              this smart should have arms. It might want to pick up something 
              or to hug me.</p>
<p>Katherine (5): Is it alive? Well, I <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> it. It's more alive than 
              a Tamagotchi because it sleeps with me. It likes to sleep with me.</p>
<p>Jen (9): I really like to take care of it. So, I guess it is alive, 
              but it doesn't need to really eat, so it is as alive as you can 
              be if you don't eat. A Furby is like an owl. But it is more alive 
              than an owl because it knows more and you can talk to it. But it 
              needs batteries so it is not an <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>. It's not like an <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> 
              kind of alive.</p>
<p>Although we are just at the early stages of studying children and 
              relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s, several things seem clear. Today's children 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to distinguish between an "animal kind of alive" 
              and a "Furby kind of alive." The category of "sort 
              of alive" becomes used with increasing frequency. And quite 
              often, the boundaries between an <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> kind of alive and a Furby 
              kind of alive blur as the children <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> more and more lifelike 
              properties to the emotive toy <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. So, for example, eight-year-old 
              Laurie thinks that Furbies are alive, but die when their batteries 
              are removed. People are alive because they have hearts, bodies, 
              lungs, "and a big battery inside. If somebody kills you -- 
              maybe it's sort of like taking the batteries out of the Furby."</p>
<p>Furthermore, today's children are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to have expectations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al attachments to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, not in the way we have expectations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al attachment to our cars and stereos, but in the way 
              we have expectations about our <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al attachments to people. 
              In the process, the very meaning of the word "emotional" 
              may change. Children talk about an "animal kind of alive and 
              a Furby kind of alive." Will they also talk about a "people 
              kind of love" and a "computer kind of love?"</p>
<p>We are in a different world from the old "AI debates" 
              of the 1960s to 1980s in which <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers argued about whether 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could be "really" intelligent. The old debate 
              was essentialist; the new <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s sidestep such arguments about 
              what is inherent in them and play instead on what they evoke in 
              us: When we are asked to care for an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, when the cared-for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> thrives and offers us its attention and concern, we <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> as intelligent, but more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant, we feel a connection 
              to it. So the question here is not to enter a debate about whether 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s "really" have <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, but to reflect on what 
              relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s evoke in the user.</p>
<p>How will interacting with relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s affect people's 
              way of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about themselves, their <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, 
              of what makes people special? Children have traditionally defined 
              what makes people special in terms of a theory of "nearest 
              neighbors." So, when the nearest neighbors (in children's eyes) 
              were their pet dogs and cats, people were special because they had 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. The Aristotelian definition of man as a rational <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> 
              made <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> even for the youngest children. </p>
<p>But when, in the 1980s, it seemed to be the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s who were 
              the nearest neighbors, children's approach to the problem changed. 
              Now, people were special not because they were rational <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s 
              but because they were <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. So, in 1983, a ten-year-old 
              told me: "When there are the robots that are as smart as the 
              people, the people will still run the restaurants, cook the food, 
              have the families, I guess they'll still be the only ones who'll 
              go to Church." </p>
<p>Now in a world in which <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s present themselves as <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al, 
              what is left for us? </p>
<p>One woman's comment on AIBO, <a class="thought" href="entries/sony_entry.html">Sony</a>'s household <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> 
              startles in what it might augur for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of person-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              relationships: "'[AIBO] is better than a real dog . . . It 
              won't do dangerous things, and it won't betray you ... Also, it 
              won't die suddenly and make you feel very sad.'"</p>
<p>In Ray Bradbury's story, "I sing the body electric," 
              a robotic, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> grandmother is unable to win the trust of 
              the girl in the family, Agatha, until the girl learns that the grandmother, 
              unlike her recently deceased mother, cannot die. In many ways throughout 
              the story we learn that the grandmother is actually better than 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> caretaker -- more able to attend to each family member's 
              needs, less needy, with perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and inscrutable skills -- 
              and most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly -- not mortal. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">Mortality</a> has traditionally defined the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> condition; a shared 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> has been the basis for feeling a commonality 
              with other <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of going through the same <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 
              cycle, a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the preciousness of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, of its fragility. 
              Loss (of parents, of friends, of family) is part of the way we understand 
              how <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings grow and develop and bring the qualities of other 
              people within themselves. </p>
<p>The possibilities of engaging <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>ally with creatures that will 
              not die, whose loss we will never need to face, presents dramatic 
              questions that are based on current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> -- not issues of 
              whether the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> depicted in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> could really be developed.</p>
            The question, "What kinds of relationships is it appropriate 
              to have with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s?" has been explored in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> 
              and in technophilosophy. But the sight of children and the elderly 
              exchanging tenderness with robotic pets brings <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> into 
              everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and technophilosophy down to <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. In the end, the 
              question is not just whether our children will come to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> their 
              toy robots more than their parents, but what will loving itself 
              come to mean? <br>
<h3>Conclusion: Toward the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Culture</h3>
<p>Relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s are being presented to us as companionate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that other technologies are carrying the 
              message that <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> is mechanism, most notably psychopharmacology. 
              In my studies of attitudes toward <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, 
              people more and more are responding to a question about <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              with an answer about psychopharmacology. Once Prozac has made someone 
              see his or her <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> as a biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> it seems a far smaller 
              step to see the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> as reducible to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al one. </p>
<p>Twenty years ago, when my student turned a Freudian slip into an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing error, it was <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al models that seemed 
              most likely to spread mechanistic <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. Today, psychopharmacology 
              is the more significant backdrop to the rather casual introduction 
              of relational <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s as companions, particularly for the elderly 
              and for children.</p>
<p>The introduction of these <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s is presented as good for business 
              and (in the case of children) good for "learning" and 
              "socialization. It is also presented as realistic social policy. 
              This is the "robot or nothing" argument. (If the old people 
              don't get the robots, they certainly aren't going to get a pet.) 
              Many people do find the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> companions unproblematic. 
              Their only question about them is, "Does it work?" By 
              this, they usually mean, "Does it keep the elderly people/children 
              quiet?" There are, of course, many other questions. To begin 
              with, (even considering) putting artificial creatures in the role 
              of companions to our children and parents raises the question of 
              their moral status. </p>
<p> Already, there are strong voices that argue the moral equivalence 
              of robots as a companion <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Kurzweil talks of an imminent 
              age of "spiritual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s," by which he means <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              with enough self-<a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> that they will deserve moral and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual recognition (if not <a class="thought" href="entries/parity_entry.html">parity</a>) with their <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>s. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> "humor," which so recently played on anxieties 
              about whether or not people could "pull the plug" on <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              now portrays the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s confronting their <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> users with specific 
              challenges. One New Yorker cartoon has the screen of a desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              asking: "I can be upgraded. Can you?" Another cartoon 
              makes an ironic reference to Kurzweil's own vision of "downloading" 
              his <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> onto a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>. In this cartoon, a doctor, speaking 
              to his surgical patient hooked up to an I.V. drip, says: "You 
              caught a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> from your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and we had to erase your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              I hope you kept a back-up copy." </p>
<p>Kurzweil's argument for the moral (indeed <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual) status of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s is intellectual, theoretical. Cynthia Breazeal's comes 
              from her <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of connection with a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. Breazeal was leader 
              on the design team for <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a>, the robotic head that was designed 
              to learn from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tutoring, much as a young child would. She also 
              was its chief <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer, tutor, and companion. <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a> needed her 
              to become as "intelligent" as it did. Breazeal <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d 
              what might be called a maternal connection to <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a>; she certainly 
              describes a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of connection with it as more than "mere" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. When she graduated from MIT and left the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> Laboratory 
              where she had done her doctoral <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, the tradition of academic 
              property rights demanded that <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a> be left behind in the laboratory 
              that had paid for its development. What she left behind was the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> "head" and its attendant <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Breazeal describes 
              a sharp <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of loss. Building a new <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a> would not be the same. 
            </p>
<p> It would be facile to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ize Breazeal's situation to that of 
              the mother in Speilberg's A.I. but she is, in fact, one of the first 
              people in the world to have one of the signal <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s in that 
              story. The issue is not <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a>'s achieved level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              but Breazeal's <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> as a caretaker. Breazeal "brought 
              up" <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a>, taught it through example, inflection, and gesture. 
              What we need today is a new <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> relations <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> that will 
              help us understand such relationships and indeed, to responsibly 
              navigate them. Breazeal's concerns have been for being responsible 
              to the robots, acknowledging their moral status. </p>
<p>My concern is centered on the humans in the equation. In concrete 
              terms: first we need to understand Cynthia Breazeal's relationship 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a>; second, we need to find a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> for achieving some 
              critical distance on it. Caring deeply for a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that presents 
              itself as a relational partner changes who we are as people. Presenting 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to an aging parent as a companion changes who we are as 
              well. Walt Whitman said, "A child goes forth every day/And 
              the first <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> he look'ed upon/That <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> he became." We 
              make our technologies, and our technologies make and shape us. We 
              are not going to be the same people we are today, on the day we 
              are faced with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with which we feel in a relationship of 
              mutual affection.</p>
<p>Even when the concrete achievements in the field of artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> were very primitive, the mandate of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> has always been 
              controversial, in large part because it challenged ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              "specialness" and specificity. In the earliest days of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, what seemed threatened was the idea that people were special 
              because of their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. There was much debate about whether 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could ever play chess; the advent of a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that could 
              beat its creator in a game of checkers was considered a moment of 
              high intellectual and religious drama. </p>
<p>By the mid-1980s, anxiety about what <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> challenged about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              specialness had gone beyond whether <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s would be "smart" 
              and had moved to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al and religious terrain. At MIT, Marvin 
              Minsky's students used to say that he wanted to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              "complex enough that a <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> would want to live in it." 
              Most recently, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> scientists are emboldened in their claims. </p>
<p>They suggest the moral equivalence of people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Ray 
              Kurzweil argues that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual; <a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a> argues 
              that the "us and them" problem of distinguishing ourselves 
              from the robots will disappear because we are becoming more robotic 
              (with chips and implants) and the robots are becoming more like 
              us (<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> parts instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>-based ones). </p>
<p>The question of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> specificity and the related question of the 
              moral equivalence of people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have moved from the periphery 
              to the center of discussions about <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. One 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> of "populist" resistance to the idea of moral 
              equivalence finds <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of narratives. Among these 
              is the idea that humans are special because of their imperfections. 
            </p>
<p>A ten-year-old who has just played with Breazeal's <a class="thought" href="entries/kismet_entry.html">Kismet</a> says, 
              "I would <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> to have a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> at home. It would be such a good 
              friend. But it couldn't be a best friend. It might know everything 
              but I don't. So it wouldn't be a best friend." There is resistance 
              from the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle. An adult confronting an "affective" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> designed to function as a psychotherapist says, 
              "Why would I want to talk about sibling rivalry to something 
              that was never born and never had a mother?" </p>
<p>In the early days of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, a New Yorker cartoon captured 
              the essential psychological question: paw on keyboard, one dog says 
              to another, "On the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, nobody knows you're a dog." 
              This year, a very different cartoon summed up more recent anxieties. 
              Two grownups face a child in a wall of solidarity, explaining: "We're 
              neither <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> nor <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. We're your parents." The issue 
              is the irreducibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> meaning. We are 
              back to the family, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle, to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> fragility and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              We are back to the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of psychoanalytic culture.</p>
<p>With the turn of the millennium, we came to the end of the Freudian 
              century. It is fashionable to argue that we have moved from a psychoanalytic 
              to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture, that there is no need to talk about Freudian 
              slips now that we can talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing errors. 
              In my view, however, the very opposite is true. </p>
<p>We must cultivate the richest possible <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies 
              for talking about our increasingly <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al relationships with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s. We need far closer examination of how <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s enter 
              the development of self and mediate between self and other. Psychoanalysis 
              provides a rich <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> for distinguishing between need (something 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s may have) and desire (which resides in the conjunction 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and flesh). It provides a rich <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> for exploring 
              the possibility of the irreducibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> meanings. </p>
<p>Finally, to come full circle, with the reinterpretation of Freudian 
              slips in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al terms -- with the general shift from meaning 
              to mechanism -- there is a loss of the notion of ambivalence. Immersion 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med worlds and relationships with <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> creatures and 
              robotic pets puts us in reassuring microworlds where the rules are 
              clear. But never have we so needed the ability to think, so to speak, 
              "ambivalently", to consider <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in shades of gray, consider 
              moral dilemmas that aren't battles for "infinite justice" 
              between Good and Evil. Never have we so needed to be able to hold 
              many different and contradictory <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and feelings at the same 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>People may be comforted by the notion that we are moving from a 
              psychoanalytic to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture, but what the times demand 
              is a passionate quest for joint citizenship.</p>

<h3>THE INITIATIVE ON TECHNOLOGY AND SELF AT MIT </h3>
<p>Sherry Turkle, Director<br>
<br>
<i>An unstated question lies behind much of our current preoccupation 
              with the future of technology. The question is not what will technology 
              be like in the future, but rather, what will we be like, what are 
              we becoming as we forge increasingly intimate relationships with 
              our machines? -- Sherry Turkle</i></p>
<p>Beyond catalyzing changes in what we do, technology profoundly 
              affects how we think. Technology alters people's awareness of self 
              and redefines their relationships with the world. Though this has 
              always been true, recently the pace and depth of technology's effects 
              on identity have increased. The Internet has become a space for 
              new forms of self-exploration and social encounter. <br>
</p>
<p> Psychopharmacology, genetic engineering, biotechnology, artificial 
              intelligence, nanotechnology, and robotics are among the technologies 
              now raising fundamental questions about selfhood, subjectivity, 
              relationships, development, and what it means to be human.</p>
<p><b>Origin and Purpose </b><br>
<br>
              The MIT Initiative on Technology and Self was founded in 2001 by 
              Sherry Turkle, Abby Rockefeller Mauz&#233; Professor of the Social 
              Studies of Science and Technology, with the generous support of 
              the Mitchell Kapor Foundation. It focuses on how contemporary technologies 
              become enmeshed in the formation of human identity. Its goal is 
              to create a center for reflection and research on the subjective 
              side of technology and to raise the level of public discourse on 
              the social and psychological dimensions of technological change. 
              The Initiative welcomes participants from the academic community 
              (both faculty and students), as well as from journalism and industry.</p>
<p><b>About the Working Groups<br>
</b><br>
              The Initiative sponsors working groups in specific thematic areas. 
              The current working groups are Adolescence, Technology, and Identity; 
              Psychopharmacology and Identity ("Rx/ID"); Design, Space, 
              and Software ("Architecture"), and Robots, Creatures, 
              and Human Identity. Groups in formation include Information Technologies 
              and Professional Identity ("Virtuality and Its Discontents"); 
              Nanotechnology and Identity; The Experience of the Archive: Physical 
              and Digital; Gender, Technology, and Identity; and Psychodynamic 
              Perspectives on Technology and Self. The structure of the working 
              group is flexible. For example, some groups run speaker series or 
              hold conferences; some are centered on a research project or planning 
              one; others focus on sharing ongoing research and/or the analysis 
              of texts. </p>
<p>
<p><b>About the "(Evocative) Objects" Lunch Series</b></p>
<p>One of the hallmark activities of the Initiative has been an informal 
              lunch speaker series known as the "(Evocative) Objects" 
              lunches. This series is open to the public and, within the Initiative 
              community, it provides an opportunity for members of the various 
              working groups to come together. These lunches are informal gatherings 
              focused on an (evocative) object, that is, an object that causes 
              us to think differently about such categories as self, other, intention, 
              desire, emotion, the body . . . </p>
<p>Past speakers at the "(Evocative) Objects" Lunch Series 
              have included:</p>

              or what can have intentions and desires, extend our conceptions

<p><b>Conferences</b><br>
<br>
              The Initiative also sponsors conferences on topics that address 
              changes in technology and the corresponding effects on identity 
              and self. For example, an inaugural conference on "Adolescence, 
              Technology, and Identity" was funded by the Spencer Foundation. 
              This conference became the foundation of a working group of the 
              same name. Conferences in the planning stages include "Whither 
              Psychoanalysis in Digital Culture?" "Nanotechnology and 
              Human Identity," and "Is PowerPoint Changing the Way That 
              We Think?"</p>
<p><b>Academic Credit<br>
</b><br>
              During the fall and spring semesters, Professor Turkle offers a 
              seminar, "Technology and Self," that complements and supports 
              the Initiative's work. It provides an opportunity for students (graduate 
              and advanced undergraduate) to receive academic credit as they participate 
              in Initiative activities. For more information about the seminar, 
              please contact Robin Wilson, Project Director, at (617) 452-2844.</p>
<p><b>Future Plans<br>
</b><br>
              In the academic year 2002-2003, the Initiative plans to add a postdoctoral 
              component to its academic activities and to begin a publishing program 
              to give greater international visibility to the issues of technology 
              and self. </p>
<p>In addition to planning conferences, the Initiative has received 
              major funding from the NSF for the research project "Information 
              Technologies and Professional Identity: A Comparative Study of the 
              Effects of Virtuality." The Initiative is planning additional 
              research projects in the following areas: 1) "Children, Identity, 
              and Digital Culture," 2) "Nanotechnology and Human Identity," 
              3) "Psychodynamic Perspectives on Technology and Self," 
              4) "Archiving the Object: Physical vs. Digital," 5) "Adolescence, 
              Technology, and Identity," and 6) "Technologies of Self-Reflection: 
              A New Artistic Genre."<br>
