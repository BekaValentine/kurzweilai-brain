<p>Originally published March 1997 at online magazine <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225034030/http://www.furious.com/perfect/moog.html" target="_new">Perfect Sound Forever</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net January 29, 2002.</p>
<p>That ingenious musical contraption that we know as the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> came about when <a class="thought" href="entries/moog_entry.html">Robert Moog</a> worked out the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> in the early '60s. By then, Moog had already been running his own company for 10 years, manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> devices/instruments. There had been a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> instruments developed before (including the theremin, which Moog worked with) but once the Moog <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> came about, it launched music into unknown dimensions. This would also lead to the drum machines, <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a>, samplers and other <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> that are commonplace in the music that you hear today. Rock, disco, house, new age, progressive rock and many other musical styles would never be the same without the Moog. Awards have been justly heaped on him from Universities, Billboard magazine and the NARAS (who hand out the Grammies). Today, Moog heads Big Briar, once again creating <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> instruments. Not a bad legacy, you have to admit.</p>
<p>PSF (Perfect Sound Forever): How did you get interested in electronics?</p>
<p>My father was an amateur radio operator. He taught me the basics when I was a little kid, maybe eight years old or so, and I was hooked.</p>
<p>PSF: Other than Theremin, were there other electronics pioneers that inspired you?</p>
<p>I used to study the schematics of Hammond, Baldwin, and Wurlitzer, but I didn't find out too much about the actual people who designed the stuff until I went to college.</p>
<p>PSF: What led you to the creation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>?</p>
<p>In 1964 I met Herbert Deutsch, who was (and still is) a composer and music teacher at Hofstra University. He asked me if I knew anything about <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> music, and told me that he wanted to find a source of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> instruments for making new musical sounds. I worked with Herb for a couple of weeks, at the end of which, we had some basic ideas for the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>.</p>
<p>PSF:Were you surprised by how well accepted it became?</p>
<p>Well, it didn't become accepted all that fast. The general public didn't know about it until Walter (later Wendy) Carlos' 'Switched-on Bach' came out at the end of 1968. Then a whole bunch of record producers tried to cash in on Carlos' success and produced a ton of 'Moog Records' in 1969 and 1970. Most of those records were not successful, so the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> fell into some disuse. Then Keith Emerson did 'Lucky Man,' and that started rock musicians using the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> on stage. By 1973 or so, Minimoogs were finally getting popular enough to be considered 'well-accepted'. So we're talking nearly ten years between the time I began designing synthesizers and the time they became well accepted.</p>
<p>PSF: Were you worried that synthesizers would replace musicians/orchestras?</p>
<p>I was never worried that synthesizers would replace musicians. First of all, you have to be a musician in order to make music with a <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>. And second, I never <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> sounds would ever be mistaken for traditional musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> sounds. To me the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> was always a source of new sounds that musicians could use to expand the range of possibilities for making music.</p>
<p>PSF: Who were some of your first buyers of the synthesizers?</p>
<p>The first person to buy a <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> from us was Alwin Nikolais, a choreographer of modern and experimental dance. Nikolais was already making his own dance scores on tape. Our second customer was Eric Siday, a well-known composer of music for radio and television commercials. Then we made stuff for a lot of the academic and experimental musicians, especially Vladimir Ussachevsky, who founded the Columbia Princeton <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> Center.</p>
<p>PSF: Do you see the programming flexibility with synthesizers happening with other instruments?</p>
<p>For experimental musicians, having a <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> was right in line with experiments that had been going on with all musical instruments- finding different ways of playing conventional instruments so that new sounds were created. I think that these experiments affected the design of synthesizers, and the synthesizers encouraged musicians to further explore the capabilities of traditional acoustic instruments.</p>
<p>PSF: Synthesizers decreased in size and got more powerful (like computers)- was that your original intention?</p>
<p>That's a general trend of all <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> equipment. It wasn't our intention so much as something that we knew would probably happen.</p>
<p>PSF: Have there been some unusual <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> models that you've created or helped create?</p>
<p>We've done a lot of experimental stuff that never went into production. I think my favorite was a four-oscillator <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> that was controlled from a pitch follower <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>, that we built for the electric sax player Eddie Harris. Eddie used it for years and made several records with it.</p>
<p>PSF: Are there any particular <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> musicians who you enjoy or find bring out the real potential of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>?</p>
<p>That's a really hard question to answer. Every creative musician brings out something different from the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>. To name a couple, I've enjoyed everything that Wendy Carlos, Jan Hammer, and Keith Emerson have done. I've also enjoyed some really interesting work that experimental composers like Jon Weiss have done.</p>
<p>PSF: What do you think was your original musical intentions with the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>- making sound effects, imitating other instruments, making unique sounds, all of these?</p>
<p>It was certainly not imitating other instruments! 'Making unique sounds' is close to our original musical intentions. I would say that we wanted to give musicians new ways of working with sounds.</p>
<p>PSF:John Cage and David Tudor worked on some designs for synthesizers. What kind of work did they do in this regard?</p>
<p>John Cage was a composer. He was a 'systems' person, meaning that he <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> in terms of hooking up different already-existing devices into an elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. David Tudor was also a composer, but he built most of his own equipment. For him, his equipment was an integral and inseparable <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of his compositions. I wouldn't say that either John Cage or David Tudor actually designed synthesizers.</p>
<p>PSF: Are there any particular creations/inventions related to the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> that you are especially proud of?</p>
<p>Well, I'm well-known for the lowpass filter that is the basis of 'the Moog Sound'. It's a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> but it works really well. Also, just the idea of a modular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> where everything works with everything else has turned out to be a useful <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> for musicians.</p>
<p>PSF: Other companies sprung up making synthesizers (ARP, Oberheim)- what made Moog different?</p>
<p>I don't think there's any one thing. Each of us had our own sense of what kind of sounds were good, what kind of front panel controls musicians would relate to most easily, and what <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> functions would be best. I can't tell you, for sure, what made the Moog instruments sound the way they did. It's a combination of a lot of subtle but small things.</p>
<p>PSF: Did you see the progression to sequencers, <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> and tape samplers as inevitable?</p>
<p>Sure. There were lots of predecessors to those things. Look at the Mellotron, with its tape loops. It wasn't too hard to see that once <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> audio became possible, Mellotron <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> would give way to what we now call samplers. The same is true of <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> and sequencers.</p>
<p>PSF: What led you back to working with theremins?</p>
<p>I never stopped working with theremins. Even while I worked for Moog <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, I built custom theremins from time to time. After I left <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> and returned to North Carolina, I decided to come up with a completely new theremin design. That became our 'Series 91' instruments. We've been making them for about six years now.</p>
<p>PSF: What do you think is the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of synthesizers?</p>
<p>Back in the late '70s, I wrote a long article on the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> music for a magazine called 'The <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> Journal.' In that article, I predicted that the band of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> would have its own finely-crafted custom controllers, but that the sound-producing <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> would be standardized to the point where it would be part of the facilities of the hall, like a sound <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. I think we're getting close to that now. Look at instruments like the '<a class="thought" href="entries/zen_entry.html">Zen</a> Drum' which is a beautiful percussion controller that plugs into fairly standard sound modules via <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a>. I still think that this is the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>: finely-crafted control devices (performance interfaces), standardized sound producers, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> to link the two.</p>
