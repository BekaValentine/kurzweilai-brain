<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>For as long as people have been making <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, they have been 
              trying to make them intelligent. This generally unsuccessful effort 
              has had more of an impact on our own ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and 
              our place in the world than on the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s' ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. 
              The few real successes have come about either by cheating, or by 
              appearing to. In fact, the profound consequences of the most mundane 
              approaches to making <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s smart point to the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              lesson that we must learn for them to be able to learn: <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is connected with <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. We need all of our senses to make 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the world, and so do <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>A notorious precedent was <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in Vienna in 1770, when Wolfgang 
              van Kempelen constructed an automaton for the amusement of Empress 
              Maria Theresa. This <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> had a full-size, mustachioed, turbaned 
              Turk seated before a <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> board, and an ingenious assortment of 
              gears and pulleys that enabled it to move the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> pieces. Incredibly, 
              after van Kempelen opened the mechanism up for the inspection and 
              admiration of his audiences and then wound it up, it could play 
              a very strong game of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>. His marvel toured throughout Europe, 
              amazing Benjamin Franklin and Napoleon.</p>
<p>After von Kempelen's <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> the Turk was sold in 1805 to Johann 
              Maelzel, court mechanic for the Habsburgs, supporter of Beethoven, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of the metronome. Maelzel took the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> further 
              afield, bringing it to the United States. It was there in 1836 that 
              a budding newspaper reporter, Edgar Allan Poe, wrote an expos&#233; duplicating 
              an earlier analysis in London explaining how it worked. The base 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> was larger than it appeared; there was room for a 
              small (but very able) <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> player to squeeze in and operate the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>While the Turk might have been a fake, the motivation behind it 
              was genuine. A more credible attempt to build an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              was made by <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a>, the Lucasian Professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">Mathematics</a> 
              at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839. This is the seat that was held by 
              Sir <a class="thought" href="entries/newton_entry.html">Isaac Newton</a>, and is now occupied by <a class="thought" href="entries/hawking_entry.html">Stephen Hawking</a>. Just in 
              case there was any doubt about his credentials, his full title was 
              "<a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a>, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., F. Stat. 
              S., Hon. M.R.I.A., M.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.P.S., Commander of the Italian <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a> of St. 
              Maurice and St. Lazarus, Inst. Imp. (Acad. Moral.) Paris Corr.,

              Lyncei. <a class="thought" href="entries/rom_entry.html">Rom</a>., Mut., Philomath. Paris, Soc. Corr., etc." No hidden 
              compartments for him.</p>
<p>Babbage <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to make the first <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, inspired by 
              the Jacquard looms of his day. The <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s woven into fabrics by 
              these giant <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s were <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med by holes punched in cards that 
              were fed to them. Babbage realized that the instructions could just 
              as well represent the sequence of instructions needed to perform 
              a mathematical calculation. His first <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> was the Difference 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>, intended to evaluate quantities such as the trigonometric 
              functions used by mariners to interpret their sextant readings. 
              At the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> these were laboriously calculated by hand and collected 
              into error-prone tables. His <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> mechanically <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed all 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s that we take for granted in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> today, 
              reading in input instructions on punched cards, storing variables 
              in the positions of wheels, performing logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s with gears, 
              and delivering the results on output dials and cards. Because the 
              mechanism was based on discrete states, some errors in its <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> 
              could be tolerated and corrected. This is why we still use <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s today.</p>
<p>Babbage oversaw the construction of a small version of the Difference 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a> before the project collapsed due to management problems, 
              lack of funding, and the difficulty of fabricating such complex 
              mechanisms to the required tolerances. But these mundane details 
              didn't stop him from turning to an even more ambitious project, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a>. This was to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that could <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> 
              with abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s and not just <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s. Babbage and his accomplice, 
              Lady Ada Lovelace, realized that an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> could just as well manipulate 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s of a mathematical formula. Its mechanism could embody 
              the rules for, say, <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> and punch out the result of a derivation. 
              As Lady Lovelace put it, "the <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a> weaves <a class="thought" href="entries/algebra_entry.html">algebra</a>ical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s just as the Jacquard Loom weaves flowers and leaves."</p>
<p>Although Babbage's designs were correct, following them went well 
              beyond the technological means of his day. But they had an enormous 
              impact by demonstrating that a mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could perform what 
              appear to be intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s. Darwin was most impressed by 
              the complex behavior that Babbage's <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s could display, helping 
              steer him to the recognition that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> organization might 
              have a mechanistic explanation. In Babbage's own memoirs, <i>Passages 
              from the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> of a Philosopher</i>, he made the prescient observation 
              that</p>
<p class="BlockQuotation">
<blockquote>It is impossible to construct <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry occupying unlimited 
              space; but it is possible to construct finite <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, and to 
              use it through unlimited <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. It is this substitution of the <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> which I have made use of, to limit 
              the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> and yet to retain its unlimited power.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mability of his <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s would permit them, and their 
              later <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> brethren, to perform many different functions with 
              the same fixed mechanism.</p>
<p>As the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designer it is fitting that he was also the 
              first to underestimate the needs of the market, saying, "I propose 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a> I am constructing to have places for only a thousand 
              constants, because I think it will be more than sufficient." Most 
              every <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> since has run into the limit that its users wanted 
              to add more <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> than its designers <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> they would ever need. 
              He was even the first <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer to complain about lack of standardization:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>I am unwilling to terminate this chapter without reference 
              to another difficulty now arising, which is calculated to impede 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of Analytical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>. The extension of analysis is 
              so rapid, its <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> so unlimited, and so many inquirers are entering 
              into its fields, that a variety of new <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s have been introduced, 
              formed on no common principles. Many of these are merely new ways 
              of expressing well-known functions. Unless some philosophical principles 
              are generally admitted as the basis of all notation, there appears 
              a great probability of introducing the confusion of Babel into the 
              most accurate of all <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Babbage's frustration was echoed by a major <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> company years 
              later in a project that <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> philosophers to work on coming up with 
              a specification for the theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">knowledge representation</a>, an ontological 
              standard, to solve the problem once and for all. This effort was 
              as unsuccessful, and interesting, as Babbage's <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s.</p>
<p>Babbage's notion of one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> being able to compute anything 
              was picked up by the British mathematician <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>. He was working 
              on the "Entscheidungsproblem," one of a famous group of open mathematical 
              questions posed by David Hilbert in 1900. This one, the tenth, asked 
              whether a mathematical procedure could exist that could decide the 
              validity of any other mathematical statement. Few questions have 
              greater implications. If the answer is yes, then it could be possible 
              to automate <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and have a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> prove everything that 
              could ever be known. If not, then it would always be possible that 
              still greater truths could lay undiscovered just beyond current 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>In 1936 Turing proved the latter. To do this, he had to bring some 
              kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to the notion of a smart <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Since he couldn't 
              anticipate all the kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s people might build, he had 
              to find a general way to describe their capabilities. He did this 
              by introducing the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a Universal <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>. This was 
              a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that had a tape (possibly infinitely long), and 
              a head that could move along it, reading and writing marks based 
              on what was already on the tape. Turing showed that this <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              could perform any <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> that could be done by any other <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, 
              by preparing it first with a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> giving the rules for interpreting 
              the instructions for the other <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. With this result he could 
              then prove or disprove the Entscheidungsproblem for his one <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              and have it apply to all of the rest. He did this by showing that 
              it was impossible for a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to exist that could determine whether 
              another <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> would eventually halt or keep running forever.</p>
<p>Although a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> was a theoretical construction, in the 
              period after World War II a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of laboratories turned to successfully 
              making <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to replace the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s" who 
              followed written instructions to carry out calculations. These <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              prompted Turing to pose a more elusive question: could a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              be intelligent? Just as he had to quantify the notion of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              to answer Hilbert's problem, he had to quantify the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              to even clearly pose his own question. In 1950 he connected the 
              seemingly disparate worlds of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              through what he called the Imitation Game, and what everyone else 
              has come to call the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. This presents a person with two 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> terminals. One is connected to another person, and the 
              other to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. By typing questions on both terminals, the 
              challenge is to determine which is which. This is a quantitative 
              test that can be run without having to answer deep questions about 
              the meaning of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Armed with a test for <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, Turing wondered how to go about 
              developing a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that might display it. In his elegant essay 
              "Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>ry and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>," he offers a suggestion for 
              where to start:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>We may hope that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will eventually compete with 
              men in all purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones 
              to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many people think 
              that a very abstract activity, like the playing of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, would 
              be best.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Turing <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> so; in 1947 he was able to describe a <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Since then <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> has been studied by 
              a who's who of computing pioneers who took it to be a defining challenge 
              for what came to be known as <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>. It was <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              that if a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could win at <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> it would have to draw on fundamental 
              insights into how humans think. Claude Shannon, the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_theory_entry.html">Information Theory</a>, which provides the foundation for modern <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, designed a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> in 1949 and was 
              able to get it running to play endgames. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that 
              could play a full game of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> was developed at <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> in 1957, and 
              an MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> won the first tournament match against a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> player 
              in 1967. The first grandmaster lost a game to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in 1977.</p>
<p>A battle raged among <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> developers between those who 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that it should be approached from the top down, studying 
              how humans are able to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> so effectively with such slow processors 
              (their brains), and those who <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that a bottom-up approach 
              was preferable, simply throwing the fastest available <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> at 
              the problem and checking as many moves as possible into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. 
              The latter approach was taken in 1985 by a group of graduate students 
              at Carnegie Mellon who were playing hooky from their thesis <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              to construct a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. They used a service just 
              being made available through the Defense Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects 
              Agency (<a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a>) to let <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers design their own <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> would combine these into wafers that were fabricated by <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> 
              foundries. The Carnegie Mellon <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> was called "Deep <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a>" 
              after the not-quite-omniscient <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/adams_entry.html">Douglas Adams</a>'s 
              <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">Galaxy</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1988 the world <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> champion Gary Kasparov said there was "no 
              way" a grandmaster would be defeated by a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in a tournament 
              before 2000. Deep <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a> did that just ten months later. <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> later 
              hired the Carnegie Mellon team and put a blue suit on the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, 
              renaming it "<a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>." With a little more understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> 
              and a lot faster processors, <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was able to evaluate 200 
              million positions per second, letting it look fifteen to thirty 
              moves ahead. Once it could see that far ahead its play took on occasionally 
              spookily <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> characteristics. <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> beat Kasparov in 1997.</p>
<p>Among the very people you would expect to be most excited about 
              this realization of Turing's <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers in artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the reaction to the victory has been curiously muted. 
              There's a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> is little better than van Kempelen's 
              Turk. Nothing was learned about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by putting a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, and the argument holds that nothing has 
              been learned by putting custom chips inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> 
              is seen as a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/idiot_savant_entry.html">idiot savant</a>, able to play a good game of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> 
              without understanding why it does what it does.</p>
<p>This is a curious argument. It retroactively adds a clause to the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, demanding that not only must a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> be able to match 
              the performance of humans at quintessentially intelligent tasks 
              such as <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>, but the way that it does so must 
              be deemed to be satisfactory. Implicit in this is a strong technological 
              bias, favoring a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> appropriate for a particular 
              kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Although brains can do many things in parallel 
              they do any one thing slowly; therefore <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing must use 
              these parallel pathways to best advantage. Early <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were 
              severely limited by speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and so useful <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s had 
              to be based on efficient insights into a problem. More recent <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              relax these <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s so that a brute-force approach to a problem 
              can become a viable solution. No one of these approaches is privileged&amp;#8212each 
              can lead to a useful kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a way that is appropriate 
              for the available means. There's nothing fundamental about the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              associated with any one physical mechanism for manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>The question of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is sure to be so controversial 
              because it is so closely linked with the central mystery of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, our <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. If a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> behaves intelligently, 
              do we have to ascribe a kind of awareness to it? If we do, then 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> holds deep lessons about the essence of our own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>; 
              if not, it challenges the defining characteristic of being <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. 
              Because our self-awareness is simultaneously so familiar and so 
              elusive, most every mechanism that we know of gets pressed into 
              service in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> of an explanation. One vocal school holds that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> is needed to explain <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> 
              describes how tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s behave. It is a bizarre world, remote 
              from our sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, in which things can be in many places 
              at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and looking at something changes it. As best I've 
              been able to reconstruct this argument, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing is that (1) 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is mysterious, (2) quantum &#173;mechanics is mysterious, 
              (3) nonquantum attempts to explain <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> have failed, therefore 
              (4) <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is quantum&#173;mechanical. This is a beautiful belief 
              that is not motivated by any <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al evidence, and does not 
              directly lead to testable <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al predictions. Beliefs about 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> that are not falsifiable have a central place in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>&#8212;they're called <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>.</p>
<p>I spent an intriguing and frustrating afternoon running over this 
              argument with an eminent believer in quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. He agreed 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> was not founded on either <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al evidence 
              or testable predictions, and that beliefs that are <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s of faith 
              rather than observation are the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, 
              but then insisted that his belief was a scientific one. This is 
              the kind of preordained <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing that drove Turing to develop his 
              test in the first place; perhaps an addendum is needed after all 
              to ask the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> how it feels about winning or losing the test.</p>
<p>The very power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that we construct turns them into 
              powerful metaphors for explaining the world. When computing was 
              done by people rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing 
              was embodied in a pencil and a sheet of paper. Accordingly, the 
              prevailing description of the world was matched to that representation. 
              Newton and Leibniz's theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a>, developed around 1670, 
              provided a notation for manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s representing the value 
              and changes of continuous quantities such as the orbits of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. 
              Later physical theories, like <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, are based on this 
              notation.</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> Leibniz also designed a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> for multiplying 
              and dividing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s, extending the capabilities of Pascal's 1645 
              adding <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. These <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s used gears to represent <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s as 
              discrete rather than continuous quantities because otherwise errors 
              would inevitably creep into their calculations from mechanical imperfections. 
              While a roller could slip a small amount, a gear slipping is a much 
              more unlikely <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. When Babbage started building <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to evaluate 
              not just arithmetic but more complex functions he likewise used 
              discrete values. This required approximating the continuous changes 
              by small differences, hence the name of the Difference <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>. These 
              approximations have been used ever since in <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              to allow them to manipulate models of the continuous world.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1940s with John von Neumann, people realized that 
              this practice was needlessly circular. Most physical phenomena start 
              out discrete at some level. A fluid is not actually continuous; 
              it is just made up of so many <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that it appears to be continuous. 
              The equations of <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> for a fluid are themselves an approximation 
              of the rules for how the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s behave. Instead of approximating 
              discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s with continuous equations that then get approximated 
              with discrete variables on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, it's possible go directly 
              to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> model that uses discrete values for <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. 
              Like the checkers on a checkerboard, tokens that each represent 
              a collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s get moved among sites based on how the 
              neighboring sites are occupied.</p>
<p>This idea has come to be known as <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">Cellular Automata</a> (CAs). From 
              the 1970s onward, the group of Ed Fredkin, Tomaso Toffoli, and Norm 
              Margolus at MIT started to make special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s designed 
              for CAs. Because these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s entirely dispense with approximations 
              of continuous functions, they can be much simpler and faster. And 
              because a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> can be described this way, a CA can do 
              anything that can be done with a conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> model of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is no less fundamental 
              than one based on <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a>. It's a much more natural description 
              if a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> instead of a pencil is used to work with the model. 
              And the discretization solves another problem: a continuous quantity 
              can represent an infinite amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. All of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              could be stored in the position of a single dot on a piece of paper, 
              where the exact location of the dot is specified to trillions of 
              digits and the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is stored in the values of those digits. Of 
              course a practical dot cannot be specified that precisely, and in 
              fact we believe that the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is 
              finite so that there must be a limit. This is built into a CA from 
              the outset.</p>
<p>Because of these desirable features, CAs have grown from a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              convenience into a way of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. For the true believers they provide 
              an answer to the organization of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. We've found that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s are made of rocks, that rocks are made up of atoms, the 
              atoms are made up of <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> is made 
              up of <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neutron_entry.html">neutron</a>s, which in turn are made up of quarks. 
              I spent another puzzling afternoon with a CA <a class="thought" href="entries/guru_entry.html">guru</a>, who was explaining 
              to me that one needn't worry about this subdivision continuing indefinitely 
              because it must ultimately end with a CA. He agreed that <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              might show behavior that appears continuous, but that just means 
              that they haven't looked finely enough. In other words, his belief 
              was not testable. In other words, it was a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of personal faith. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> becomes a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> deity that 
              brings <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to the rest of the world for him.</p>
<p>Like any <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, these kinds of beliefs are enormously <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              in guiding behavior, and like any <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, dogmatic adherence to 
              them can obscure alternatives. I spent one more happily exasperating 
              afternoon debating with a great cognitive scientist how we will 
              recognize when Turing's test has been passed. Echoing Kasparov's 
              "no way" statement, he argued that it would be a clear epochal <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, 
              and certainly is a long way off. He was annoyed at my suggestion 
              that the true sign of success would be that we cease to find the 
              test interesting, and that this is already happening. There's a 
              practical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which a modern version of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is 
              being passed on a daily basis, as a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of some economic consequence.</p>
<p>A cyber <a class="thought" href="entries/guru_entry.html">guru</a> once explained to me that the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> had no 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> because it was too hard to figure out what was out there. 
              The solution to his problem has been to fight proliferation with 
              processing. People quickly realized that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s instead of people 
              could be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to browse the Web, collecting indices of everything 
              they find to automatically construct <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>able guides. These <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s multiplied because they were useful and lucrative. Their 
              success meant that Web sites had to devote more and more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to 
              answering the rapid-fire requests coming to them from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s instead 
              of the target <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> audience. Some Web sites started adding filters 
              to recognize the <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s and then deny 
              service to that address. This started an arms race. The <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s 
              responded by <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming in behavior <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s that were more like 
              humans. To catch these, the Web sites needed to refine their tests 
              for distinguishing between a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. A small industry 
              is springing up to emulate, and detect, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior.</p>
<p>Some sites took the opposite tack and tried to invite the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s in to increase their visibility. The simplest way to do 
              this was to put every conceivable <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> phrase on a Web page so 
              that any <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a> would hit that page. This led to perfectly innocent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es finding shamelessly pornographic sites that just happen 
              to mention airline schedules or sports scores. Now it was the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>'s turn to test for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior, adding routines to test 
              to see if the word use on a page reflects <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> or just a list. 
              Splitting hairs, they had to further decide if the lists of words 
              they did find reflected <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able uses such as dictionaries, or 
              just cynical Web bait.</p>
<p>Much as Gary Kasparov might feel that humans can still beat <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> in a more fair tournament, or my colleague thinks that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> for the distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, these kinds 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing tasks are entering into an endgame. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              can now beat most people at chess; <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior has 
              now become a job description. The original goals <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> for making 
              intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have been accomplished.</p>
<p>Still, smart as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s may have become, they're not yet wise. 
              As <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> points out, they lack the <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> of a six-year-old. 
              That's not too surprising, since they also lack the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              of a six-year-old. Although Marvin has been called the father of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, he feels that that pursuit has gotten stuck. 
              It's not because the techniques for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing are inadequate; they're 
              fine. The problem is that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to too little <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              to guide their <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. A blind, deaf, and dumb <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, immobilized 
              on a desktop, following rote instructions, has no chance of understanding 
              its world.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> to cognition can be seen in the wiring 
              of our brains. Our senses are connected by two-way channels: <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              goes in both directions, letting the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> fine-tune how we see 
              and hear and touch in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to learn the most about our environment.</p>
<p>This insight takes us back to Turing. He concludes "Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>ry 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>" with an alternative suggestion for how to develop 
              intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> with the best <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organs that money can buy, and then 
              teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow 
              the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and 
              named, etc.</blockquote>

<p>The money has been spent on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> instead. Perhaps 
              it's now <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to remember that they have bodies, too.</p>
