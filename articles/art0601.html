<div class="TeaserText">The next big thing in computers will be personal fabrication: allowing anyone to make fully functioning systems -- with print semiconductors for logic, inks for displays, three-dimensional mechanical structures, motors, sensors, and actuators. Post-digital literacy now includes 3D machining and microcontroller programming. For a few thousand dollars, a little tabletop milling machine can measure its position down to microns, so you can fabricate the structures of modern technology, such as circuit boards.</div>

<p><i>This is an excerpt of an article originally published on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090731131031/http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge123.html" target="_blank">Edge</a></i>,<i> 
              July 24, 2003. Published on KurzweilAI.net October 30, 2003.</i> </p>
<p>I run the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT. It&#160;involves about 
              20 research groups from across campus: biologists,&#160;chemists, 
              physicists, mathematicians, various kinds of engineers&amp;#8212all 
              people like me for whom the boundary between computer science and&#160;physical 
              science never made sense. We think about how information&#160;relates 
              its physical properties. The way the world's evolved,&#160;hardware 
              has been separated from software, and channels from their&#160;content, 
              but many of the hardest, most challenging, and most&#160;interesting 
              problems lie right at this interface. These range from&#160;some 
              of the deepest questions about how the universe works to some of&#160;the 
              most important current technological frontiers.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>Let's start with the development of "personal fabrication." 
              We've&#160;already had a digital revolution; we don't need to keep 
              having it.&#160;The next big thing in computers will be literally 
              outside the box, as&#160;we bring the programmability of the digital 
              world to the rest of the&#160;world. With the benefit of hindsight, 
              there's a tremendous historical&#160;parallel between the transition 
              from mainframes to PCs and now from&#160;machine tools to personal 
              fabrication. By personal fabrication I mean&#160;not just making 
              mechanical structures, but fully functioning systems&#160;including 
              sensing, logic, actuation, and displays.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Mainframes were expensive machines used by skilled operators for&#160;limited 
              industrial operations. When the packaging made them&#160;accessible 
              to ordinary people we had the digital revolution.&#160;Computers 
              now let you connect to Amazon.com and pick something you&#160;want, 
              but the means to make stuff remain expensive machines used by&#160;skilled 
              operators for limited industrial operations. That's going to&#160;change. 
              Laboratory research, such as the work of my colleague Joe&#160;Jacobson, 
              has shown how to print semiconductors for logic, inks for&#160;displays, 
              three-dimensional mechanical structures, motors, sensors,&#160;and 
              actuators. We're approaching being able to make one machine that&#160;can 
              make any machine. I have a student working on this project who&#160;can 
              graduate when his thesis walks out of the printer, meaning that&#160;he 
              can output the document along with the functionality for it to get&#160;up 
              and walk away.</p>
<p>In support of this basic research we started teaching a class,&#160;modestly 
              called "How To Make (almost) Anything," where we show&#160;students 
              how to use the millions of dollars of machines available at&#160;MIT 
              for making things. This was meant to be a class for technical&#160;students 
              to master the tools, but I was wholly unprepared for the&#160;reaction. 
              On the first day a hundred or so students showed up begging&#160;to 
              get into a class with room for ten people, saying "Please, 
              all my&#160;life I've been waiting for this. I'll do anything to 
              get in." Some&#160;would then furtively ask "are you allowed 
              to teach something so&#160;useful at MIT?" There was a desperate 
              demand by non-technical&#160;students to take this class, who then 
              used all of these capabilities&#160;in ways that I would never think 
              of. One student, a sculptor with no&#160;engineering background, 
              made a portable personal space for screaming&#160;that saves up 
              your screams and plays them back later. Another made a&#160;Web 
              browser that lets parrots navigate the Net.</p>
<p>From this combination of passion and inventiveness I began to get 
              a&#160;sense that what these students are really doing is reinventing&#160;literacy. 
              Literacy in the modern sense emerged in the Renaissance as&#160;mastery 
              of the liberal arts. This is liberal in the sense of&#160;liberation, 
              not politically liberal. The trivium and the quadrivium&#160;represented 
              the available means of expression. Since then we've&#160;boiled 
              that down to just reading and writing, but the means have&#160;changed 
              quite a bit since the Renaissance. In a very real sense&#160;post-digital 
              literacy now includes 3D machining and microcontroller&#160;programming. 
              I've even been taking my twins, now 6, in to use MIT's&#160;workshops; 
              they talk about going to MIT to make things they think of&#160;rather 
              than going to a toy store to buy what someone else has&#160;designed.</p>
<p>In a place like Cambridge (MA or UK) personal fabrication is not&#160;urgently 
              needed to solve immediate problems, because routine needs&#160;are 
              already met. These students were not inventing for the sake of&#160;their 
              survival, or developing products for a company; they were&#160;expressing 
              themselves technologically. They were creating the things&#160;they 
              desired, rather than needed, to make the kind of world they&#160;wanted 
              to live in.</p>
<p>Between this short-term teaching with advanced infrastructure and 
              our&#160;long-term laboratory research on personal fabrication, 
              I had an&#160;epiphany last summer: for about ten thousand dollars 
              on a desktop you&#160;can approximate both. What makes this possible 
              is that space and time&#160;have become cheap. For a few thousand 
              dollars a little tabletop&#160;milling machine can measure its position 
              down to microns, a fraction&#160;of the size of a hair, and so you 
              can fabricate the structures of&#160;modern technology such as circuit 
              boards for components in advanced&#160;packages. And a little 50-cent 
              microcontroller can resolve time down&#160;below a microsecond, 
              which is faster that just about anything you&#160;might want to 
              measure in the macroscopic world. Together these&#160;capabilities 
              can be used to emulate the functionality of what will&#160;eventually 
              be integrated into a personal fabricator.</p>
<p>So we started an experiment.</p>
<p>Long before the research was done, we thought that it would be 
              a good&#160;idea to learn something about who would care and what 
              it's good for.&#160;We started using micromachining and microcontrollers 
              to set up field&#160;"fab labs" (either fabulous, or fabrication, 
              as you wish). They&#160;weren't meant to be economically self-sustaining; 
              it was just a way&#160;of building up experience. We intentionally 
              put them beyond the reach&#160;of normal technology in places like 
              rural India and the far north of&#160;Norway. Once again we found 
              a desperate response, but here personal&#160;fabrication does address 
              what can truly be life-and-death problems.</p>
<p>In one of these labs in rural India they're working on technology 
              for&#160;agriculture. Their livelihood depends on diesel engines, 
              but they&#160;don't have a way to set the timing. The instrument 
              used in your&#160;corner garage to do that costs too much, there 
              is no supply chain to&#160;bring it to rural India, and it wouldn't 
              work in the field anyway.&#160;So, they're working on a little microcontroller 
              sensor device that&#160;can watch the flywheel going by and figure 
              out when fuel is coming&#160;in. Another project aimed a $50 Webcam 
              at a diffraction grating to do&#160;chemical spectroscopy in order 
              to figure out when milk's going bad,&#160;when it's been diluted, 
              and how the farmers should be fairly paid.&#160;Another fab lab 
              is in the northeast of India, where one of the few&#160;jobs that 
              women can do is Chikan embroidery. The patterns are limited&#160;by 
              the need to stamp them with wooden blocks that are hard to make&#160;and 
              modify; they're now using the lab to make 3D scans of old blocks&#160;and 
              3D machine new ones. At the other end of the world, at the top&#160;tip 
              of Norway, there's a fab lab that is being used to develop radio&#160;"bells" 
              so that nomadic data can follow the Sami's nomadic herds of&#160;sheep 
              and reindeer around the mountains.</p>
<p>Each of these examples really are matters of survival for these&#160;people. 
              Silicon Valley start-ups aren't trying to solve these&#160;problems, 
              and even if they were, the business models are unlikely to&#160;work 
              on this scale. Through fab labs, locally-appropriate solutions&#160;can 
              be developed and then produced locally. The design files can also&#160;be 
              shared globally, for open-source hardware as well as software&#160;problem 
              solving.</p>
<p>Working on this project has led to some very strange days in&#160;Washington 
              DC for me, where I'll go from the World Bank to the&#160;National 
              Academies to the Pentagon, and they all want to talk about&#160;the 
              same thing. The possibility of personal fabrication is enormously&#160;important 
              for each of these institutions' agendas, but it does not&#160;easily 
              fit into their existing organizations. </p>
<p>The World Bank is trying to close the digital divide by bringing 
              IT&#160;to the masses. The message coming back for the fab labs 
              is that&#160;rather than IT for the masses the real story is IT 
              development for&#160;the masses. Rather than the digital divide, 
              the real story is that&#160;there's a fabrication and an instrumentation 
              divide. Computing for&#160;the rest of the world only secondarily 
              means browsing the Web; it&#160;demands rich means of input and 
              output to interface computing to&#160;their worlds. </p>
<p>The National Academies have been trying very hard to interest people&#160;in 
              science and engineering, but on balance they've not been very&#160;successful 
              at doing that. But the fab lab experience suggests that,&#160;instead 
              of just trying to get people interested in learning about&#160;science, 
              it's far more compelling to enable them to actually do&#160;science 
              that's personally meaningful. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>just an idea about nanomanufactoring: 
<br>
<br>
would it be possible to digitally model a sort of space, just like the negative of a film. If we are talking about replacing atoms in its right place, then why not construct a space filled with right atoms so that they will form or match with the atoms of the object to be constructed through a process, lets say positive/negative charge . Lets call it a negative envelope. when opened, inevitably shall be filled/attracted with the positive atoms to form the object to be constucted nanotechnologically. This whole thing comes from the very idea that positive particules will attract negative ones and vice versa

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>- &amp; + charge elements do attract.  I don't know is the Science is there yet to do this.  I think I would need a whole new level of understanding of the Periodic Table (creative thinking).  I will put it on the mental hard drive and throw some serious processing power on it.  You are on the right track (I think anyway).
<br>
<br>
What I already have is an idea that uses - + as a energy source.  I don't know if it will work though.  This is do to the Law of Conservation.  In order to get a large about of - + atoms you need a certain amount of energy to do this.  When processing energy the idea is to produce more energy then the sum used to create it (surplus). 
<br>
<br>
Bad Weather. Lightening. This is my idea.  A lightening bolt contains a huge amount of energy.  If you could create a lightening bolt that, well, would not stop lighting this could be a big deal.  My idea is to use an inert gas(es).  Lets say you one side is - and the other +.  If you have the gases "mingle" in an electrical dance and never fully integrate.  I think the electrical output would be in surplus.  How much?
