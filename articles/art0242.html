<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/barbour_entry.html">JULIAN BARBOUR</a>: The question I'm always asking myself is, what is the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and how does it work? I come at it from the point of view of fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, basic questions of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> and its relationship to classical mechanics. <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> was discovered in 1925-1926, and it gave a completely new picture of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> which was extraordinarily surprising, and it's still very difficult to understand. It suggests the world is not at all like we see it. That has remained a really big problem, and it's getting more and more discussion, more and more interest from people. This is what I'm really <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about; how to reconcile the fact that the world seems to be classical, we seem to have unique past, things seem to be in definite positions, and have a definite <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>--that's what it seems to be like, but <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> tells us that it is different--not like that at all. The aim is to try and find a description of the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that is quantum mechanical and understand how it nevertheless it can look like the classical world that we actually see and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>.</p>
<p>I came into it quite by chance by reading a newspaper article about the attempts that the great Paul Dirac, one of the discoverers of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, was making about 40 years ago to bring it together with Einstein's general theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>. He'd come across a rather surprising fact and this led him to question whether the picture of space--time that was the whole basis of Einstein's theory really was as fundamental as people had <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. This prompted me to think about <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> itself. For nearly 36 years now, I've been <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and trying to understand it at the most fundamental level. If you look at the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, surprisingly few people have really <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and what it truly is. Even Einstein only <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about certain aspects about <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>; he never asked what it means to say that a second today is the same as a second tomorrow. This is a very fundamental question. Einstein somehow assumed that it is meaningful, but he never actually asked how does that come about and how can that be? He never defined the notion of duration. So there are aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that haven't been fully studied, in my opinion.</p>
<p>JB: Can you give me another example besides duration?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: Certainly. One of the great questions in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> is whether there's some sort of invisible framework in which everything unfolds. Newton introduced the notions of absolute space and absolute <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Absolute space is like a translucent glass block that stretches from <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>; it's a fixed frame of reference in which everything happens. Newtonian <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is like some invisible river that flows uniformly for ever. The trouble with this is that we can't see this invisible framework, all we see are things moving relative to each other. This is the relational viewpoint, as opposed to the absolute viewpoint of Newton. The challenge has been to create a theory containing genuine relationships between genuine things, and not relationships between real things and unobservable things. That's what I've spent a lot of my <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> working on. It's given me the ideas which I'm trying now to develop into a complete <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>, a complete explanation of what the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is.</p>
<p>JB: Did you ever get to talk to Dirac?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: I tried. I was studying in Munich when I read the article about him. I got so hooked on the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that I went back to England try and see Dirac in Cambridge. I actually spoke to him on the phone, but he wasn't a very talkative person and he wasn't all that interested in meeting somebody who'd got half--<a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>--out ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. I can certainly understand that.</p>
<p>JB: Are the ideas full--baked now?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: They're certainly not as half--baked as they were. They've definitely taken quite a shape. I hope some at least will have a place in the new picture of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> for which so many physicists are groping, one that is completely quantum--mechanical and not half quantum and half classical. What my Italian collaborator Bruno Bertotti and I managed to show is that the world is strongly relational according to the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> as we know it now, but this hasn't been properly recognized. The people like Leibniz and Ernst Mach who criticized Newton really were right. Einstein somehow or other put this into his theory without anyone, including Einstein himself, properly appreciating it. The world is relational. It is about how real things relate to real things. This is potentially important for how we try to picture the quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>JB: How do you fit into the leading edge of today's <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>--string theorists, quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> people?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: My work has little direct connection to what the string theorists do. There are two main approaches to quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, and one of them is definitely much more popular than the other, that's the <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a> line. I'm following a line that is at least twice as old but followed by far fewer people. It is closely related to basic questions--what is <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, what is space, what is <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>? <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> has its fashions. String theorists are a bit like a pack of hounds following an extremely promising scent. But it is a particular scent. If they lose the trail, nothing will come of the great chase. In contrast, those basic questions will never go away. In fact, if <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a> is successful, it will be very interesting to see how it does answer them.</p>
<p>JB: What is distinctive about your approach?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: My basic idea is that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as such does not exist. There is no invisible river of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. But there are things that you could call instants of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, or 'Nows'. As we live, we seem to move through a succession of Nows, and the question is, what are they? They are arrangements of everything in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> relative to each other in any moment, for example, now.</p>
<p>We have the strong impression that you and I are sitting opposite each other, that there's a bunch of flowers on the table, that there's a chair there and things like that--they are there in definite positions relative to each other. I aim to abstract away everything we cannot see (directly or indirectly) and simply keep this idea of many different things coexisting at once in a definite mutual relationship. The interconnected totality becomes my basic thing, a Now. There are many such Nows, all different from each other. That's my <a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>--there are Nows, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>JB: But where does our <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of the flow of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> come from?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: That has always proved to be difficult to attack, because if you try to get your hands on <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it's always slipping through your fingers. People are sure that it's there but they can't get hold of it. Now my feeling is that they can't get hold of it is because it isn't there at all. That what we think is the flow of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>--and even seeing <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>--is actually an illusion. But I come to that after seeing what the <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> of the complete <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> might be like.</p>
<p>JB: Sounds tough. Have you got a simple picture?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: Let's take a simple model; suppose there were just three particles in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and nothing else. In some instant they would be in certain positions relative to each other and would form some triangle. Newton claimed that this triangle has in addition some position in absolute space and that it's changing in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. What I'm saying is that there isn't any of that external framework of space and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, there's just the possible triangles that the particles form. The triangles do not occur somewhere in absolute space at some instant of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, some Now. The triangles are the Nows. You are forced to some view like this if the invisible framework is denied. If we had a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> with a million particles in it there would be some relative <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> of those million particles and nothing else. That would form one Now, and all the different ways you could arrange all the million particles would make all the different possible Nows. I think the actual Nows of this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> are more sophisticated constructs involving fields, but Nows formed by arrangements of particles can get the idea across.</p>
<p>JB: Didn't Einstein abolish Nows?</p>
<p>BARBOUR: In fact no. He only showed that they do not follow one another in a unique sequence. There is no absolute simultaneity in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, or at least not in the classical <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. But relative simultaneity remains, and Nows as I define them form an integral part of Einstein's theory. Actually the discovery of Dirac that started all my interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was that Nows appeared to be far more significant in the quantum world than one might have expected coming from the normal interpretation of Einstein's <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>.</p>

<br>
<br>
What Einstein discovered was that space, time, mass, energy, and motion were all interconnected in such a way that changes in one impacted the others. His Special Relativity theory showed that the faster one travels, the more the length of one's vehicle contracts in the direction on travel and that time slows down. What seems to be fixed and absolute in conventional reality turns out to be fluid and malleable when examined at a deeper level.

Because our ideas about reality are formed out of our moment to moment environment, it is hard to put aside these entrenched concepts and to think 'outside the box'. Science today, as it reaches into the quantum world has to deal with a reality quite different that what we know in our common experience.
<br>
<br>
It is in this context that thinkers like Julian Barbour are searching for a new philosophical grounding for the concept of time. The realization that time doesn't exist independently but only in the context of other aspects of reality is a good next step in forming an alternate philosophy of nature.

Dear Prof. Julian Barbour
<br>
<br>
I'm verw happy to come across your home page and your book. I publish a book with same title "The End of The Time" in 1990 in Slovenia.
<br>
On the brief article below is the abstract of the book.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes, Amrit Sorli
<br>
<br>
<br>
TIMELESS    UNIVERSE
<br>
<br>
	In the universe the passing of physical time cannot be clearly perceived as matter and space; one can perceive only irreversible physical, chemical, and biological changes (hereinafter referred to as "change") in cosmic space. On the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can conclude that physical time exists only as a stream of change that runs through cosmic space. The terms "physical time" and "change" describe the same phenomenon. Physical time is irreversible. Change A transforms into change B, B transforms into C and so on. When B is in existence A does not exist anymore, when C is in existence B does not exist anymore. 
<br>
	The question arises: Why is it that irreversible physical time is experienced as past, present and future? The answer is obtained by analysing the scientific way of experiencing. The eyes perceive a stream of irreversible change. Once elaborated by the mind, the stream of change is experienced chronologically through psychological time that is a part of the human mind.
<br>
	Let's look at the relationship between physical and psychological time by carrying out an experiment. Take a pen and move it from the left side of the table to the right. You can perceive only the movement of the pen in space, but you experience that the pen has also moved through time. How come? Perception passes first through psychological time and then the experience occurs. That's why you experience the movement of the pen in time. But on the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can only state  that the pen has changed position in space.
<br>
	By observing the continuous stream of irreversible physical change humans have developed psychological time through which we experience the universe. Psychological time is reversible. One can go back into past. This creates an idea that physical time also has a past, but this is not so.
<br>
	General  Relativity allows for speculation about time travel. Someone could travel through a black hole with a spaceship , go back into the past and kill his grandmother. The consequence is that he could never have been born (1). Travelling into the past through black holes is not possible because physical time is irreversible; the past exists only as psychological time through which it is not possible to travel with a spaceship. 
<br>
	The speed of psychological time does not always follow physical time, it depends on one's well-being. The more relaxed you are the slower the speed of psychological time is. In modern society time passes quickly, in so called primitive societies time passed slowly. In an altered state of consciousness, such as meditation, ecstatic dance, deep prayer, psychological time stops.  	
<br>
	Already in a normal state of health there are, every now and then, aberrations of subjective time such as acceleration or deceleration of lapse of time. Under several mental disturbances (like those characterising serious mental psychoses, drug-induced states, trances, mediations, as well as other deep "altered" states of consciousness), these anomalies / peculiarities  become more pronounced. The flux of time may even cease completely (the sensations usually described as "time standing still", or "suspended", arrested" time or expand without limit (the feelings of "everlasting now, eternity") (2).
<br>
	Human consciousness has the  capacity to watch the human mind. Everybody can watch his thoughts and emotions. By watching them the speed of thought and the intensity of emotion calms down. Once the mind stops, human consciousness can watch and recognize itself (4). When the mind stops, psychological time stops too. One experiences physical time as he/she perceive it: as a stream of change. 	
<br>
	One can imagine consciousness as his/her inner space and psychological time as a stream of thoughts running in the inner space. According to the Buddhist tradition the inner space in which stream of thoughts run and outer space in which material change run are undivided. 
<br>
	Allan Wallace says: The distinction between external and internal is an illusion; internal and external space are ultimately non-dual. This is the absolute space of phenomena. In Buddhist literature, this is the Great perfection out of which the entire universe originates (3). 
<br>
	The understanding of physical time has changed over the ages. For ancient Greeks, Indians, and Mayans, time was considered a cyclic phenomenon; time moving in circles, with no beginning and no end. When Judaeo-Christian civilization arose in Europe, another understanding of time became prominent - time going forward in a straight line. According to this civilization, time has its beginning with God's creation of the universe and will have its end with the Last Judgement. In Newtonian physics, physical time is an independent quantity (absolute time), running uniformly throughout the entire cosmic space (absolute space). In the General Theory of Relativity, time is no more an independent physical quantity - it is linked with space in four-dimensional space-time. 
<br>
	Here physical time is understood as a stream of irreversible change that runs through cosmic space. It is not that change happens in physical time, change itself is physical time. The image of space-time has developed into the image of space in which change runs. We can measure with clocks the duration and speed of change. Experiments with high precision clocks confirm that change runs slower in the parts of universal space where the gravitational field is stronger. The speed of clocks near the sea in Venice is slower than on the mountain Monte Rosa, because gravity is stronger near sea level. 
<br>
	The special theory of relativity has put forward the famous "problem of twins"; according to the special relativity, time runs slower in a fast moving space ship than on Earth, so if one of the twins were to travel through space on a fast space ship and return to Earth after five year's time, he would find himself younger than his brother who would have stayed home. Experiments with high precision clocks taken aboard fast planes have verified this. And this is where the question arises: Does time in fast flying planes really run slower than on Earth? To be empirically consequent, one has to admit that by means of an elementary perception (sight) it is only possible to conclude that the speed of clocks in a moving plane is smaller than on Earth. It is only by indirect reasoning that we interpret different clock speeds as meaning different time running speeds in the plane and on Earth.  By observing the clocks in the plane and on Earth, it is only possible to state that the speed of  change in fast moving inertial systems is lower than in slower inertial systems. Take two space ships heading towards one another on two parallel straight lines, the former moving at v1=0.5 c, the latter at v2=0.001 c (where c = speed of light). In the moment the two space ships meet, the clocks are set. The clocks on the former will run slower than the clocks on the latter, spacemen on the former will grow old slower than spacemen on the latter. The hypothesis that time as a physical quantity runs slower on the first ship than on the second, is only our deduction, and it cannot be empirically proven. 
<br>
	According to this understanding time is not a consistent part of the universe. It exists only as a "by-product" of the matter that change in the cosmic space. In the universe time does not run. Universe is an eternal self-renewing system in dynamic equilibrium. Big bangs are cyclic, they have no beginning and will have no end (4). Researches of several scientist confirm the that thesis: Kompanichenko from Russia, Turok from Cambridge and Steinhardt from Princeton.  	
<br>
	It makes sense only for humans that morning is before the evening, that father is born before the son. From the point of the universe "change before" and "change after" makes no sense, they all happen in the eternity. The idea of creation of the universe belongs to the past. There is no God that has created Universe, Universe itself is God. 
<br>
	That's why all over the universe matter has an intrinsic tendency to evolve into life and then into conscious species (5).  Human evolution is directed towards discovery of the divine quality of the universe.

<br>
You seem to assume that there is one and only one Reality in which we all exist.
<br>
<br>
I thought Korzybsky pretty much laid that fallacy to rest even in the realm of classical time and physics.
<br>
<br>
And, yes, I suspect that many of us have problems with the concept of reality when it is anyone's reality other than their own.
<br>
<br>
In MY reality, you are just a few words on a screen. Hardly real at all and certainly far different than yourself in YOUR reality.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Here is my arguement:
<br>
<br>
Time itself is a completely mental concept. It exists as a massive collection of all our nows. When we refer to time, were talking about all the nows in the universe...the ones that happened and haven't happened yet.
<br>
<br>
Our brains and sensory equipment (eyes, ears, etc.) work together to process what happens around us and too us. We then record this information. We often compare our histories (nows) together.
<br>
<br>
For a long time I thought the statement "to each his own reality" was wrong. Now I understand reality differently. When we search for the truth, we are not discovering reality....TRuh exists outside of the sphere of reality...as in each of us has our own reality. We have our own systems of management, our own collections of data, and our own methods for manipulating them. So indeed, we each have our own reality, and we can share our realities....but truth does not bend to your reality. Truth exists above all speculation and that which is unknown to us. 
<br>
<br>
Think about it...you can say the sun isn't bright, and lie to yourself forever...that is your reality, if you choose it to be, but accepting the truth...ahh thats something else. Remove denial from the equation, and keep studying! Thats what I say!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Of course, I agree. I was just using 'reality' as a term to describe the individual experience as it pertains to existence (the ultimate truth...things exist, whether you see them or not), instead of using it to describe ultimately the combined experiences of everyone...as complete REALITY...like when someone says "welcome back to reality!" Which can seem like they are saying welcome back to the real world, or 'our' world as opposed to 'yours'. :) I guess its all in how you say it and interpret it. I just find it fascinating that some people find their reality absolute above truth, which I consider outside of reality, as it is percieved by the individual.</p></td>

Dear Prof. Julian Barbour
<br>
<br>
I'm verw happy to come across your home page and your book. I publish a book with same title "The End of The Time" in 1990 in Slovenia.
<br>
On the brief article below is the abstract of the book.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes, Amrit Sorli
<br>
<br>
<br>
TIMELESS    UNIVERSE
<br>
<br>
	In the universe the passing of physical time cannot be clearly perceived as matter and space; one can perceive only irreversible physical, chemical, and biological changes (hereinafter referred to as "change") in cosmic space. On the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can conclude that physical time exists only as a stream of change that runs through cosmic space. The terms "physical time" and "change" describe the same phenomenon. Physical time is irreversible. Change A transforms into change B, B transforms into C and so on. When B is in existence A does not exist anymore, when C is in existence B does not exist anymore. 
<br>
	The question arises: Why is it that irreversible physical time is experienced as past, present and future? The answer is obtained by analysing the scientific way of experiencing. The eyes perceive a stream of irreversible change. Once elaborated by the mind, the stream of change is experienced chronologically through psychological time that is a part of the human mind.
<br>
	Let's look at the relationship between physical and psychological time by carrying out an experiment. Take a pen and move it from the left side of the table to the right. You can perceive only the movement of the pen in space, but you experience that the pen has also moved through time. How come? Perception passes first through psychological time and then the experience occurs. That's why you experience the movement of the pen in time. But on the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can only state  that the pen has changed position in space.
<br>
	By observing the continuous stream of irreversible physical change humans have developed psychological time through which we experience the universe. Psychological time is reversible. One can go back into past. This creates an idea that physical time also has a past, but this is not so.
<br>
	General  Relativity allows for speculation about time travel. Someone could travel through a black hole with a spaceship , go back into the past and kill his grandmother. The consequence is that he could never have been born (1). Travelling into the past through black holes is not possible because physical time is irreversible; the past exists only as psychological time through which it is not possible to travel with a spaceship. 
<br>
	The speed of psychological time does not always follow physical time, it depends on one's well-being. The more relaxed you are the slower the speed of psychological time is. In modern society time passes quickly, in so called primitive societies time passed slowly. In an altered state of consciousness, such as meditation, ecstatic dance, deep prayer, psychological time stops.  	
<br>
	Already in a normal state of health there are, every now and then, aberrations of subjective time such as acceleration or deceleration of lapse of time. Under several mental disturbances (like those characterising serious mental psychoses, drug-induced states, trances, mediations, as well as other deep "altered" states of consciousness), these anomalies / peculiarities  become more pronounced. The flux of time may even cease completely (the sensations usually described as "time standing still", or "suspended", arrested" time or expand without limit (the feelings of "everlasting now, eternity") (2).
<br>
	Human consciousness has the  capacity to watch the human mind. Everybody can watch his thoughts and emotions. By watching them the speed of thought and the intensity of emotion calms down. Once the mind stops, human consciousness can watch and recognize itself (4). When the mind stops, psychological time stops too. One experiences physical time as he/she perceive it: as a stream of change. 	
<br>
	One can imagine consciousness as his/her inner space and psychological time as a stream of thoughts running in the inner space. According to the Buddhist tradition the inner space in which stream of thoughts run and outer space in which material change run are undivided. 
<br>
	Allan Wallace says: The distinction between external and internal is an illusion; internal and external space are ultimately non-dual. This is the absolute space of phenomena. In Buddhist literature, this is the Great perfection out of which the entire universe originates (3). 
<br>
	The understanding of physical time has changed over the ages. For ancient Greeks, Indians, and Mayans, time was considered a cyclic phenomenon; time moving in circles, with no beginning and no end. When Judaeo-Christian civilization arose in Europe, another understanding of time became prominent - time going forward in a straight line. According to this civilization, time has its beginning with God's creation of the universe and will have its end with the Last Judgement. In Newtonian physics, physical time is an independent quantity (absolute time), running uniformly throughout the entire cosmic space (absolute space). In the General Theory of Relativity, time is no more an independent physical quantity - it is linked with space in four-dimensional space-time. 
<br>
	Here physical time is understood as a stream of irreversible change that runs through cosmic space. It is not that change happens in physical time, change itself is physical time. The image of space-time has developed into the image of space in which change runs. We can measure with clocks the duration and speed of change. Experiments with high precision clocks confirm that change runs slower in the parts of universal space where the gravitational field is stronger. The speed of clocks near the sea in Venice is slower than on the mountain Monte Rosa, because gravity is stronger near sea level. 
<br>
	The special theory of relativity has put forward the famous "problem of twins"; according to the special relativity, time runs slower in a fast moving space ship than on Earth, so if one of the twins were to travel through space on a fast space ship and return to Earth after five year's time, he would find himself younger than his brother who would have stayed home. Experiments with high precision clocks taken aboard fast planes have verified this. And this is where the question arises: Does time in fast flying planes really run slower than on Earth? To be empirically consequent, one has to admit that by means of an elementary perception (sight) it is only possible to conclude that the speed of clocks in a moving plane is smaller than on Earth. It is only by indirect reasoning that we interpret different clock speeds as meaning different time running speeds in the plane and on Earth.  By observing the clocks in the plane and on Earth, it is only possible to state that the speed of  change in fast moving inertial systems is lower than in slower inertial systems. Take two space ships heading towards one another on two parallel straight lines, the former moving at v1=0.5 c, the latter at v2=0.001 c (where c = speed of light). In the moment the two space ships meet, the clocks are set. The clocks on the former will run slower than the clocks on the latter, spacemen on the former will grow old slower than spacemen on the latter. The hypothesis that time as a physical quantity runs slower on the first ship than on the second, is only our deduction, and it cannot be empirically proven. 
<br>
	According to this understanding time is not a consistent part of the universe. It exists only as a "by-product" of the matter that change in the cosmic space. In the universe time does not run. Universe is an eternal self-renewing system in dynamic equilibrium. Big bangs are cyclic, they have no beginning and will have no end (4). Researches of several scientist confirm the that thesis: Kompanichenko from Russia, Turok from Cambridge and Steinhardt from Princeton.  	
<br>
	It makes sense only for humans that morning is before the evening, that father is born before the son. From the point of the universe "change before" and "change after" makes no sense, they all happen in the eternity. The idea of creation of the universe belongs to the past. There is no God that has created Universe, Universe itself is God. 
<br>
	That's why all over the universe matter has an intrinsic tendency to evolve into life and then into conscious species (5).  Human evolution is directed towards discovery of the divine quality of the universe.

Dear Prof. Julian Barbour
<br>
<br>
I'm verw happy to come across your home page and your book. I publish a book with same title "The End of The Time" in 1990 in Slovenia.
<br>
On the brief article below is the abstract of the book.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes, Amrit Sorli
<br>
<br>
<br>
TIMELESS    UNIVERSE
<br>
<br>
	In the universe the passing of physical time cannot be clearly perceived as matter and space; one can perceive only irreversible physical, chemical, and biological changes (hereinafter referred to as "change") in cosmic space. On the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can conclude that physical time exists only as a stream of change that runs through cosmic space. The terms "physical time" and "change" describe the same phenomenon. Physical time is irreversible. Change A transforms into change B, B transforms into C and so on. When B is in existence A does not exist anymore, when C is in existence B does not exist anymore. 
<br>
	The question arises: Why is it that irreversible physical time is experienced as past, present and future? The answer is obtained by analysing the scientific way of experiencing. The eyes perceive a stream of irreversible change. Once elaborated by the mind, the stream of change is experienced chronologically through psychological time that is a part of the human mind.
<br>
	Let's look at the relationship between physical and psychological time by carrying out an experiment. Take a pen and move it from the left side of the table to the right. You can perceive only the movement of the pen in space, but you experience that the pen has also moved through time. How come? Perception passes first through psychological time and then the experience occurs. That's why you experience the movement of the pen in time. But on the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can only state  that the pen has changed position in space.
<br>
	By observing the continuous stream of irreversible physical change humans have developed psychological time through which we experience the universe. Psychological time is reversible. One can go back into past. This creates an idea that physical time also has a past, but this is not so.
<br>
	General  Relativity allows for speculation about time travel. Someone could travel through a black hole with a spaceship , go back into the past and kill his grandmother. The consequence is that he could never have been born (1). Travelling into the past through black holes is not possible because physical time is irreversible; the past exists only as psychological time through which it is not possible to travel with a spaceship. 
<br>
	The speed of psychological time does not always follow physical time, it depends on one's well-being. The more relaxed you are the slower the speed of psychological time is. In modern society time passes quickly, in so called primitive societies time passed slowly. In an altered state of consciousness, such as meditation, ecstatic dance, deep prayer, psychological time stops.  	
<br>
	Already in a normal state of health there are, every now and then, aberrations of subjective time such as acceleration or deceleration of lapse of time. Under several mental disturbances (like those characterising serious mental psychoses, drug-induced states, trances, mediations, as well as other deep "altered" states of consciousness), these anomalies / peculiarities  become more pronounced. The flux of time may even cease completely (the sensations usually described as "time standing still", or "suspended", arrested" time or expand without limit (the feelings of "everlasting now, eternity") (2).
<br>
	Human consciousness has the  capacity to watch the human mind. Everybody can watch his thoughts and emotions. By watching them the speed of thought and the intensity of emotion calms down. Once the mind stops, human consciousness can watch and recognize itself (4). When the mind stops, psychological time stops too. One experiences physical time as he/she perceive it: as a stream of change. 	
<br>
	One can imagine consciousness as his/her inner space and psychological time as a stream of thoughts running in the inner space. According to the Buddhist tradition the inner space in which stream of thoughts run and outer space in which material change run are undivided. 
<br>
	Allan Wallace says: The distinction between external and internal is an illusion; internal and external space are ultimately non-dual. This is the absolute space of phenomena. In Buddhist literature, this is the Great perfection out of which the entire universe originates (3). 
<br>
	The understanding of physical time has changed over the ages. For ancient Greeks, Indians, and Mayans, time was considered a cyclic phenomenon; time moving in circles, with no beginning and no end. When Judaeo-Christian civilization arose in Europe, another understanding of time became prominent - time going forward in a straight line. According to this civilization, time has its beginning with God's creation of the universe and will have its end with the Last Judgement. In Newtonian physics, physical time is an independent quantity (absolute time), running uniformly throughout the entire cosmic space (absolute space). In the General Theory of Relativity, time is no more an independent physical quantity - it is linked with space in four-dimensional space-time. 
<br>
	Here physical time is understood as a stream of irreversible change that runs through cosmic space. It is not that change happens in physical time, change itself is physical time. The image of space-time has developed into the image of space in which change runs. We can measure with clocks the duration and speed of change. Experiments with high precision clocks confirm that change runs slower in the parts of universal space where the gravitational field is stronger. The speed of clocks near the sea in Venice is slower than on the mountain Monte Rosa, because gravity is stronger near sea level. 
<br>
	The special theory of relativity has put forward the famous "problem of twins"; according to the special relativity, time runs slower in a fast moving space ship than on Earth, so if one of the twins were to travel through space on a fast space ship and return to Earth after five year's time, he would find himself younger than his brother who would have stayed home. Experiments with high precision clocks taken aboard fast planes have verified this. And this is where the question arises: Does time in fast flying planes really run slower than on Earth? To be empirically consequent, one has to admit that by means of an elementary perception (sight) it is only possible to conclude that the speed of clocks in a moving plane is smaller than on Earth. It is only by indirect reasoning that we interpret different clock speeds as meaning different time running speeds in the plane and on Earth.  By observing the clocks in the plane and on Earth, it is only possible to state that the speed of  change in fast moving inertial systems is lower than in slower inertial systems. Take two space ships heading towards one another on two parallel straight lines, the former moving at v1=0.5 c, the latter at v2=0.001 c (where c = speed of light). In the moment the two space ships meet, the clocks are set. The clocks on the former will run slower than the clocks on the latter, spacemen on the former will grow old slower than spacemen on the latter. The hypothesis that time as a physical quantity runs slower on the first ship than on the second, is only our deduction, and it cannot be empirically proven. 
<br>
	According to this understanding time is not a consistent part of the universe. It exists only as a "by-product" of the matter that change in the cosmic space. In the universe time does not run. Universe is an eternal self-renewing system in dynamic equilibrium. Big bangs are cyclic, they have no beginning and will have no end (4). Researches of several scientist confirm the that thesis: Kompanichenko from Russia, Turok from Cambridge and Steinhardt from Princeton.  	
<br>
	It makes sense only for humans that morning is before the evening, that father is born before the son. From the point of the universe "change before" and "change after" makes no sense, they all happen in the eternity. The idea of creation of the universe belongs to the past. There is no God that has created Universe, Universe itself is God. 
<br>
	That's why all over the universe matter has an intrinsic tendency to evolve into life and then into conscious species (5).  Human evolution is directed towards discovery of the divine quality of the universe.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Dogen Zenji, a leading Zen master in Japan around a thousand years ago, wrote about a similar idea in a collection of his writings named the Shobogenzo.
<br>
<br>
Dogen insisted that reality was made up of separate instants of time which, in the English translation, he called 'Being-Time'.
<br>
<br>
His point was that time, in an of itself, did not exist. There are only individual moments of reality.
<br>
<br>
It is fascinating to see the way in which modern thinkers like Barbour are heading in the same direction. As Barbour points out in his interview, this approach has more predictive value than classical physics.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, he did not give a specific example of this. Hopefully, the observation can be demonstrated soon.

Dear Prof. Julian Barbour
<br>
<br>
I'm verw happy to come across your home page and your book. I publish a book with same title "The End of The Time" in 1990 in Slovenia.
<br>
On the brief article below is the abstract of the book.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes, Amrit Sorli
<br>
<br>
<br>
TIMELESS    UNIVERSE
<br>
<br>
	In the universe the passing of physical time cannot be clearly perceived as matter and space; one can perceive only irreversible physical, chemical, and biological changes (hereinafter referred to as "change") in cosmic space. On the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can conclude that physical time exists only as a stream of change that runs through cosmic space. The terms "physical time" and "change" describe the same phenomenon. Physical time is irreversible. Change A transforms into change B, B transforms into C and so on. When B is in existence A does not exist anymore, when C is in existence B does not exist anymore. 
<br>
	The question arises: Why is it that irreversible physical time is experienced as past, present and future? The answer is obtained by analysing the scientific way of experiencing. The eyes perceive a stream of irreversible change. Once elaborated by the mind, the stream of change is experienced chronologically through psychological time that is a part of the human mind.
<br>
	Let's look at the relationship between physical and psychological time by carrying out an experiment. Take a pen and move it from the left side of the table to the right. You can perceive only the movement of the pen in space, but you experience that the pen has also moved through time. How come? Perception passes first through psychological time and then the experience occurs. That's why you experience the movement of the pen in time. But on the basis of elementary perception (sight) one can only state  that the pen has changed position in space.
<br>
	By observing the continuous stream of irreversible physical change humans have developed psychological time through which we experience the universe. Psychological time is reversible. One can go back into past. This creates an idea that physical time also has a past, but this is not so.
<br>
	General  Relativity allows for speculation about time travel. Someone could travel through a black hole with a spaceship , go back into the past and kill his grandmother. The consequence is that he could never have been born (1). Travelling into the past through black holes is not possible because physical time is irreversible; the past exists only as psychological time through which it is not possible to travel with a spaceship. 
<br>
	The speed of psychological time does not always follow physical time, it depends on one's well-being. The more relaxed you are the slower the speed of psychological time is. In modern society time passes quickly, in so called primitive societies time passed slowly. In an altered state of consciousness, such as meditation, ecstatic dance, deep prayer, psychological time stops.  	
<br>
	Already in a normal state of health there are, every now and then, aberrations of subjective time such as acceleration or deceleration of lapse of time. Under several mental disturbances (like those characterising serious mental psychoses, drug-induced states, trances, mediations, as well as other deep "altered" states of consciousness), these anomalies / peculiarities  become more pronounced. The flux of time may even cease completely (the sensations usually described as "time standing still", or "suspended", arrested" time or expand without limit (the feelings of "everlasting now, eternity") (2).
<br>
	Human consciousness has the  capacity to watch the human mind. Everybody can watch his thoughts and emotions. By watching them the speed of thought and the intensity of emotion calms down. Once the mind stops, human consciousness can watch and recognize itself (4). When the mind stops, psychological time stops too. One experiences physical time as he/she perceive it: as a stream of change. 	
<br>
	One can imagine consciousness as his/her inner space and psychological time as a stream of thoughts running in the inner space. According to the Buddhist tradition the inner space in which stream of thoughts run and outer space in which material change run are undivided. 
<br>
	Allan Wallace says: The distinction between external and internal is an illusion; internal and external space are ultimately non-dual. This is the absolute space of phenomena. In Buddhist literature, this is the Great perfection out of which the entire universe originates (3). 
<br>
	The understanding of physical time has changed over the ages. For ancient Greeks, Indians, and Mayans, time was considered a cyclic phenomenon; time moving in circles, with no beginning and no end. When Judaeo-Christian civilization arose in Europe, another understanding of time became prominent - time going forward in a straight line. According to this civilization, time has its beginning with God's creation of the universe and will have its end with the Last Judgement. In Newtonian physics, physical time is an independent quantity (absolute time), running uniformly throughout the entire cosmic space (absolute space). In the General Theory of Relativity, time is no more an independent physical quantity - it is linked with space in four-dimensional space-time. 
<br>
	Here physical time is understood as a stream of irreversible change that runs through cosmic space. It is not that change happens in physical time, change itself is physical time. The image of space-time has developed into the image of space in which change runs. We can measure with clocks the duration and speed of change. Experiments with high precision clocks confirm that change runs slower in the parts of universal space where the gravitational field is stronger. The speed of clocks near the sea in Venice is slower than on the mountain Monte Rosa, because gravity is stronger near sea level. 
<br>
	The special theory of relativity has put forward the famous "problem of twins"; according to the special relativity, time runs slower in a fast moving space ship than on Earth, so if one of the twins were to travel through space on a fast space ship and return to Earth after five year's time, he would find himself younger than his brother who would have stayed home. Experiments with high precision clocks taken aboard fast planes have verified this. And this is where the question arises: Does time in fast flying planes really run slower than on Earth? To be empirically consequent, one has to admit that by means of an elementary perception (sight) it is only possible to conclude that the speed of clocks in a moving plane is smaller than on Earth. It is only by indirect reasoning that we interpret different clock speeds as meaning different time running speeds in the plane and on Earth.  By observing the clocks in the plane and on Earth, it is only possible to state that the speed of  change in fast moving inertial systems is lower than in slower inertial systems. Take two space ships heading towards one another on two parallel straight lines, the former moving at v1=0.5 c, the latter at v2=0.001 c (where c = speed of light). In the moment the two space ships meet, the clocks are set. The clocks on the former will run slower than the clocks on the latter, spacemen on the former will grow old slower than spacemen on the latter. The hypothesis that time as a physical quantity runs slower on the first ship than on the second, is only our deduction, and it cannot be empirically proven. 
<br>
	According to this understanding time is not a consistent part of the universe. It exists only as a "by-product" of the matter that change in the cosmic space. In the universe time does not run. Universe is an eternal self-renewing system in dynamic equilibrium. Big bangs are cyclic, they have no beginning and will have no end (4). Researches of several scientist confirm the that thesis: Kompanichenko from Russia, Turok from Cambridge and Steinhardt from Princeton.  	
<br>
	It makes sense only for humans that morning is before the evening, that father is born before the son. From the point of the universe "change before" and "change after" makes no sense, they all happen in the eternity. The idea of creation of the universe belongs to the past. There is no God that has created Universe, Universe itself is God. 
<br>
	That's why all over the universe matter has an intrinsic tendency to evolve into life and then into conscious species (5).  Human evolution is directed towards discovery of the divine quality of the universe.

It's great that physicists can design all these abstract metaphors to think about what they're doing, but until some application is described that shows one metaphor is more useful than another as a predictive device for our experiences, I tire being put through such loops.

literally. everybody is smart but the people who take their badges out of the closet to shine it off to those who leave it at home, the difference is the intentions of the people who Know their smart... which takes up brain power that could be used for something worthwhile. By all means, enjoy your healthy and inducing discussions, just remember not to think your wasting time by being with someone who isn't turned on by the physics of reality, cause after all, an inactive brain is clinically dead, and those are the people that drag you down. and if anbody thinks their wasting their time reading this than "all the power to ya"</p></td>

For one thing, it has allowed us to build computers that can divide a second into a hundred billion pieces and use each piece to do some work, such as make a decision about where to store data or add two numbers together.  Hertz and gigahertz are applications of the division of time that impinge on our lives on a daily basis.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>P.S.  Time is not a thing, it's an acknowledgement that everything in the universe is moving - relatively speaking. It's a measurement that compares the motion of one thing with the motion of another.  I challenge anyone out there to give me an example of time that does not involve such a comparison.  The arrow of time is based on the fact that for the life of the universe, everything in it has been moving.  Any measurement of that movement must begin at some arbitrary point and end at some equally arbitrary point.  Changing the direction of what you are measuring will not change the measurement, so you can't "go back" in time.  Almost all measures of time involve a comparison of the motion of something with the rotation of the earth.  If you talk about stopping time, you are really talking about stopping the motion of everything in the universe.</p></td>

You seem to imply that you have a satisfactory explanation...at least satisfactory to you...however that isn't enough reason for the rest of the world to "get over" their curiosity.

Hey world! This guy understands time, we can all stop thinking about it now! ...yeah, right.

Other than that you comment is hardly insightful or useful. Give us your explanation such that we all accept it and can "move on"...please.</p></td>
