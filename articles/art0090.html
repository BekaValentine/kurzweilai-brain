<span class="Caption">A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> image.</span>
<br>Let us review a few of the fundamental issues underlying the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">age of intelligent machines</a>.</p><h1>Will <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s Reach <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>?</h1><p>As I noted in the last section of the previous chapter, the strengths of today's <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are quite different from those of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and in many ways complement it. Once we have defined the transformations and methods underlying intelligent processes, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can carry them out tirelessly and at great speed. It can call upon a huge and extremely reliable <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and keep track of billions of facts and their relationships. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, on the other hand, though weak at mastering facts, still excels at turning <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The ability to recognize, understand, and manipulate the subtle <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> inherent in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> continues to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> apart.</p>
<p>Yet <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are clearly advancing in these skills. Within narrow domains--diagnosing certain classes of disease, performing financial judgments, and many other specialized tasks--<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s already rival <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> experts. During the 1980s <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s went from <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> experiments to commercially viable tools that are relied upon daily to perform important jobs. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s have also begun in recent years to master the pattern-recognition tasks inherent in vision and hearing.</p>
<p>Though not yet up to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> standards, pattern-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is sufficiently advanced to perform a wide variety of practical tasks. It is difficult to estimate when these capabilities will reach <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels, but there does not appear to be any fundamental barrier to achieving such levels. Undoubtedly, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will achieve such levels gradually; no bell will ring when it happens.</p>
<p>What is clear is that by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of performance in those areas of traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> strength, they will also have greatly enhanced their areas of traditional superiority. (Not all experts agree with this. Doug Hofstadter, for example, speculates in <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i> that a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> "actually intelligent" <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> may not be able to do fast accurate arithmetic, because it will get distracted and confused by the concepts triggered by the numbers-a dubious-proposition in my view.<sup>1</sup>) Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can read and understand what it is reading, there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why it should not read everything ever written (encyclopedias, reference works, books, journals and magazines, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> bases, etc.) and thus master all <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>As Norbert Wiener has pointed out, no <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being has had a complete mastery of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> for the past couple centuries (and it is doubtful in my view that anyone has ever had such mastery). Even mere <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> combined with a thorough mastery of all <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> would give <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s unique intellectual skills. Combine these <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s' traditional strengths of speed, tireless operation, prodigious and unfailing <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and extremely rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, and the result will be formidable. We are, of course, not yet on the threshold of this vision. This early phase of the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">age of intelligent machines</a> is providing us with obedient servants that are not yet intelligent enough to question our demands of them.</p>
<p>Minsky points out that we have trouble imagining <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s achieving the capabilities we have because of a deficiency in our concept of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.<sup>'2</sup> The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race first encountered <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (of its own creation) as <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with a few dozen, and in some cases a few hundred, active parts. Today, our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have millions of active <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, yet our concept of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> as a relatively inflexible <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> with only a handful of behavioral options has not changed. By the end of this century chips with over a billion <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s are anticipated, and we will enter an era of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with many billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s.</p>
<p>Clearly, the subtlety and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of the behavior of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s at those different levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> are quite different. Emulating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of performance will require trillions, perhaps thousands of trillions, of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. At current rates of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, we shall achieve such levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> early in the next century. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will not automatically follow, but <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able extrapolations of the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a broad variety of skills in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, fine motor coordination, decision making, and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> acquisition leads to the conclusion that there is no fundamental barrier to the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> field's ultimately achieving this objective.</p><h1>Can a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> Think?</h1><p>The question sounds innocuous enough, but our approach to it rests on the meanings we ascribe to the terms "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>" and "think." Consider first the question of whether or not a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being is certainly not like the early <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-made <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, with only a handful of parts. Yet are we fundamentally different from a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, one with, say, a few trillion parts? After all, our bodies and brains are presumably subject to the same natural laws as our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, this is not an easy question, and several thousand years of philosophical debate have failed to answer it. If we assume that the answer to this question is no (humans are not fundamentally different from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s), then we have answered the original question. We presumably think, and if indeed we are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, then we must conclude that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can think. If, on the other hand, we assume that we are in some way fundamentally different from a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, then our answer depends on our definition of the word "think."<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>First, let us assume a behavioral definition, that is, a definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> based on <i>outwardly</i> observable behavior. Under this definition, a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> should be considered to think if it appears to engage in intelligent behavior. This, incidentally, appears to be the definition used by the children I interviewed (see the section "Naive Experts" in chapter 2). Now the answer is simply a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of the level of performance we expect. If we accept levels of performance in specific areas that would be considered intelligent if performed by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, then we have achieved intelligent behavior in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s already, and thus we can conclude (as did the children I talked with) that today's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we expect an overall level of cognitive ability comparable to the full range of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, then today's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s cannot be regarded as <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. If one accepts my conclusion above that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will eventually achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of intellectual ability, then we can conclude that it is inherently possible for a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to think, but that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> have not yet started to do so.</p>
<p>If one accepts instead an intuitive definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, that is, an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is considered to be <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> if it "seems" to be <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, then responses will vary widely with the person assessing the "seeming." The children I spoke to felt that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s seemed to think, but many adults would disagree. For myself, I would say that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s do not yet <i>seem</i> to be <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, although occasionally a clever leap of insight by a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> I am interacting with will make it seem, just for a moment, that <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is taking place.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the most difficult approach. If we define <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> to involve <i>conscious intentionality</i>, then we may not be in a position to answer the question at all. I know that I am conscious, so I know that I think (hence Descartes's famous dictum "I think, therefore I am"). I assume that other people think (lest I go mad), but this assumption appears to be built in (what philosophers would call <i>a priori</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>), rather than based on my observations of the behavior of other people. I can imagine <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can understand and respond to people and situations with the same apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> as real people (see some of the scenarios above).</p>
<p>The behavior of such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s would be indistinguishable from that of people; they would pass any behavioral test of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, including the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. Are these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s conscious? Do they have genuine intentionality or <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>? Or are they just following their <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s? Is there a distinction to be made between conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a> and just following a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>? Is this a distinction with a difference? Here we arrive once again at the crux of a philosophical issue that has been debated for several thousand years.</p>
<p>Some observers, such as Minsky and Dennett, maintain that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is indeed an observable and measurable facet of behavior, that we can imagine a test that could in theory determine whether or not an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is conscious. Personally, I prefer a more subjective concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, the idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is a reality appreciated only by its possessor. Or perhaps I should say that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is the possessor of the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, rather than the other way around. If this is confusing, then you are beginning to appreciate why <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> has always been so difficult.</p>
<p>If we assume a concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> based on <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and hold that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is detectable in some way, then one has only to carry out the appropriate experiment and the answer will be at hand. (If someone does this, let me know.) If, on the other hand, one accepts a subjective view of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, then only the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> itself could know if it is conscious and thus <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> (assuming it can truly <i>know</i> anything). We could, of course, ask the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> if it is conscious, but we would not be protected from the possibility of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> having been <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to lie. (The philosopher Michael Serwen once proposed building an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that could not lie and then simply asking it if it was conscious.)</p>
<p>One remaining approach to this question comes to us from <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. In perhaps its most puzzling implication, <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> actually ascribes a physical reality to <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Quantum theory states that a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> cannot have both a precise location and a precise <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>. If we measure its <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> precisely, then its location becomes inherently imprecise.</p>
<p>In other words, its location becomes a probability cloud of possible locations. The reverse is also true: measuring its precise location renders its <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> imprecise. It is important to understand exactly what <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> is trying to say. It is not saying that there is an underlying reality of an exact location and <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> and that we are simply unable to measure them both precisely. It is literally saying that if a conscious being measures the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>, it actually renders the <i>reality</i> of the location of that <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> imprecise.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> is addressing not simply limitations in observation but the impact of conscious observation on the underlying reality of what is observed. Thus, <i>conscious</i> observation actually changes a property of a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>. Observation of the same <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> by a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that was not conscious would not have the same effect. If this seems strange to you, you are in good company. Einstein found it absurd and rejected it.<sup>4</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> is consistent with a philosophical tradition that ascribes fundamental reality to <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, as opposed to <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> simply being a reflection of some other fundamental reality.<sup>5</sup>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> is more than just a philosophical viewpoint, however: its predictions have been consistently confirmed. Almost any <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> of the past 20 years demonstrates its principles, since the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> is an embodiment of the paradoxical predictions of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> is the only theory in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> to ascribe a specific role to <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> beyond simply saying that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is what may happen to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> that evolves to high levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> according to physical laws.</p>
<p>If one accepts its notions fully, then <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> may imply a way to physically detect <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. I would counsel caution, however, to any who would be builder of a <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> detector based on these principles. It might be upsetting to point a quantum-mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> detector at ourselves and discover that we are not really conscious after all.</p>
<p>As a final note on <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> let me provide a good illustration of the central role it ascribes to <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. According to <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, observing the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> affects not only the preciseness of its location but also affects the preciseness of the location of certain types of "sister" <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s that may have emerged from the same <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> interaction that produced the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> whose <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> we just observed.</p>
<p>For example, if an interaction produces a pair of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s that emerge in opposite directions and if we subsequently observe the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of one of the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, we will instantly affect the preciseness of the position of both that <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> and its sister, which may be millions of miles away. This would appear to contradict a fundamental tenet of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>: that effects cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. This paradox is currently under study.<sup>6</sup>
</p><h1>What Impact Will the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a> Have on Society?</h1><p>When <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were first invented in the mid 1940s, they were generally regarded as curiosities, though possibly of value to <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and a few <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering disciplines. Their value to <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, business, and other disciplines soon became apparent, and exploration of their practical applications soon began.</p>
<p>Today, almost a half-century later, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are ubiquitous and highly integrated into virtually all of society's institutions. If a law were passed banning all <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (and in the doubtful <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that such legislation were adhered to), society would surely collapse. The orderly functioning of both <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> and business would break down in <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. We are already highly dependent on these "amplifiers of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>," as Ed Feigenbaum calls them.</p>
<p>As the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s improves and broadens, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will become increasingly integrated into our decision-making, our economy, our work, our <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, our ability to communicate, and our <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> styles. They will be a driving force in shaping our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> world. But the driving force in the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will continue to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, at least for the next half century.</p><h1>A Final Note</h1><p>When I was a boy, I had a penchant for collecting magic tricks and was known to give magic shows for friends and family. I took pleasure in the delight of my audience in observing apparently impossible phenomena. It became apparent to me that organizing ordinary methods in just the right sequence could give rise to striking results that went beyond the methods I started with. I also realized that revealing these methods would cause the magic to disappear and leave only the ordinary methods.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I discovered a more powerful form of magic: the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Again, by organizing ordinary methods in just the right sequences (that is, with the right <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s), I could once again cause delight. Only the delight caused by this more grown-up magic was more profound. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>ized <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that help overcome the handicaps of the disabled or provide greater expressiveness and <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> for all of us provide measures of delight more lasting than the magic tricks of childhood.</p>
<p>The sequences of <i>1</i>s and <i>0</i>s that capture the designs and <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s of our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s embody our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and wealth. And unlike more ordinary magic, any revelation of the methods underlying our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> magic does not tarnish its enchantment.</p><h1>Notes</h1><a name="r1"></a>
