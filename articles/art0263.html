<blockquote>
<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> is power and permits the wise to conquer without bloodshed and to accomplish deeds surpassing all others.</blockquote>
<blockquote>--Sun Tzu (Chou Dynasty philosopher and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> strategist), The <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">Art</a> of War, fourth century B.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Originally published November 1991. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 6, 2001.</p>
<p>Some of our trading partners have indeed been accomplishing deeds surpassing all others and doing so without bloodshed. As I discussed in my previous two columns, we are entering an age in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and the requisite skills to create and convey <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> are approaching dominance in our increasingly interdependent world. So how are we doing in providing our emerging generations with the necessary competence and expertise? And what role can <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> itself play in enhancing the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process?</p>
<p>In assessing our educational resources, there is good news and bad. We have the finest university <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in the world, which provides the <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> for many of the world's leaders (in all fields). We have the ability to recognize talent and provide a relatively optimal <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> for our best and brightest, or at least those fortunate enough to live in affluent neighborhoods. On the other hand, we are failing the rest of the population.</p>
<p>In international tests ranking American students with their counterparts in Europe and Japan, our students generally come out last or close to last in math and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. Japanese students almost always rank first. Ninety percent of Japanese students graduate high school, which includes the equivalent of two years of American college studies (including one year of <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a>). Only 70 percent of our students graduate high school, and a disturbingly high fraction of these graduates lack basic reading and technical skills.</p>
<p>Copying the Japanese <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> (or any of the European systems) here is not the answer. We need to reflect the different strengths of our respective societies. Japan benefits from the homogeneity of its culture with a common tradition going back thousands of years. In sharp contrast, we benefit from the diverse roots of our people. We are the only <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> in the world purposely formed from every other <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. What works well for Japan and many European countries--enforced national standards--is not the answer for our uniquely diverse <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.</p>
<p>We could, however, do worse than to follow Japan in certain other ways. On several recent trips to the Far East, I was struck by the central role of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> in Japanese <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. I was taken on a tour of leading Japanese libraries and was impressed with the deeply respectful, almost reverent attitude toward books as gateways to <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>. At the same time, I was shown plans for a massive <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>-led initiative to develop and subsequently distribute a new generation of educational <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to provide Japanese students with advanced workstations, <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to comprehensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> bases, and advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-assisted instruction. Japan is a fascinating blend of the old and the new, and we could take a lesson in both.</p><h1>Eight benefits of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></h1><p>With respect to the new, we have no national policy or <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> of any substantive <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> to use powerful emerging technologies that can play a key role in transforming the effectiveness of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. These technologies are not intended to replace teachers or books, but nonetheless provide a range of critical benefits that are not widely understood. To share my perspective, the following describes what I regard as the eight benefits of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> process.</p>
<p>
<b>Computer</b><b> </b><b>technology</b><b> can provide students with power over the process of </b><b>learning</b><b>.</b> In working with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-assisted reading instruction <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that I was involved in creating, students were able to have printed passages read to them (while they visually studied the words) ten, 20, even 30 times without having to deal with an intimidating teacher who might get irritated after three or four requests for repetition.</p>
<p>
<b>Technology</b><b> can broaden the dynamic between challenge and skill.</b> Recently I had the opportunity to discuss educational <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/kay_entry.html">Alan Kay</a>, the noted <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist who originated the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the "desktop metaphor," the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> for a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> using a mouse and icons that has made the <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> Macintosh so popular (first implemented by Kay and his associates in the Xerox Altos, an early prototype of a "<a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>," a term that Kay originated).</p>
<p>Kay, who describes himself as a "Luddite who creates <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>," described to me the dynamic relationship between challenge and skill in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. If challenge exceeds skill at any point, the result is anxiety. If skill exceeds challenge, the result is boredom. Both emotions are detrimental to the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process. Riding between these two opposing forces is a thin channel or flow of useful <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. The tricky part of this dynamic is that the student's skill is constantly changing (hopefully improving), so maintaining the optimal tension between challenge and skill for each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> student becomes very difficult and is rarely achieved.</p>
<p>Kay points out two essential ways in which <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can improve this process by broadening this thin channel. We can broaden the channel (of effective <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>) on the anxiety side (toward greater challenge) by providing the student with greater safety. By allowing him or her to fail privately, he or she is emboldened to attempt greater challenges. In my own view, great achievements in life are attained by a willingness to fail, an attitude that failure is not what counts. that ten failures and one achievement is better than never having tried. I have watched children tread fearlessly, and surprisingly successfully, into domains one would have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> exceeded their abilities given the <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> and safety net of computerized <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Conversely, we can broaden the channel on the boredom side (toward greater skill) by providing the student with greater awareness of his/her own <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process. Computerized systems can provide webs of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that allow the exploration of topics along intuitive networks that increase awareness and leave little opportunity for boredom.</p>
<p>
<b>Technology</b><b> can provide students with early experiences of success.</b> Educational music <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, for example, can provide students with the thrill of creating music in the first few sessions. In traditional approaches to <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> the piano, in contrast, students typically do not gain sufficient keyboard skills to obtain a musically rewarding <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> for several years, during which time most students drop out.</p>
<p>
<b>Technology</b><b> draws students' attention.</b> Consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> attained by the nation's nine-year-olds on the legend of Zelda (a popular Nintendo game). Most can recite the properties of each magic shield and have developed an intimate familiarity with every hidden forest. Imagine if instead of the usual array of swords and sorcerers these games allowed children to explore the battle of Gettysburg, the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of the atom, or the intricacies of the human body.</p>
<p>Many observers have criticized the paucity of educational <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> for the ubiquitous Nintendo <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>. I spoke recently with Doug Carlston, the founder and CEO of Broderbund, a leading developer and producer of educational <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, who lamented Nintendo's restrictive licensing policies that make it economically prohibitive to provide third-party educational applications. Nintendo itself has emphasized <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> games and the few educational titles it has provided have not been of the same quality. An industry of d educational <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> has emerged, however, on other platforms (particularly personal computers) that allow users of all ages to learn through exploration. For example, the popular series of Sim City, Sim <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, and now Sim Ant provide the opportunity to probe richly detailed simulations of social, ecological, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> systems.</p>
<p>
<b>Technology</b><b> can be a mediun for enhanced human </b><b>communication</b><b>.</b> Japan has committed to installing a high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> (ten billion bit per second) fiber optic-based <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> superhighway into every home and office by early in the next century. With such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, a class in Kyoto will be able to actively participate in a lesson complete with questions and answers given by a Nobel Prize winner in Tokyo. It has been estimated that 30 to 40 percent of Japan's GNP will be derived from this vital <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> infrastructure. I recently participated in a Hudson Institute conference on communications <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that cited the profound educational and economic implications of such a communications <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> and called for the creation of a comparable American <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Even today's relatively crude copper-based <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> already provides a fascinating forum for an exchange of views and expertise that cuts across all lines of age and status. Teenagers tying into <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> bulletin boards from their bedrooms can interact with eminent scientists, business and academic leaders, not to mention other teenagers. When not engaging in <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> conversations with other persons, they can tie into extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> bases through both <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a> drives.</p>
<p>On many American campuses today, students are required to obtain laptop or notebook computers. At MIT, students can plug their laptops into the omnipresent <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> outlets around campus and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> extensive libraries of scientific literature; communicate with other students and professors; tie into a national <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> that links leading colleges around the country; and even submit their term papers electronically. Now a new generation of notebook computers is emerging that communicates without wires using cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Technology</b><b> requires students to be actively rather than passively engaged.</b> Television, another powerful medium for <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, has been criticized as encouraging viewers to put heir brains in a passive mode as the torrent of images and sounds wash over them. In contrast, books require a certain amount of reflection and interpretation. Even with a book, however, it is certainly possible for a student to remain passive and indifferent to assigned readings. Properly designed educational <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, by providing immediate feedback and interaction, can leave little room for detachment.</p>
<p>
<b>Technology</b><b> can provide equal </b><b>access</b><b> to </b><b>information</b><b> for individuals with sensory disabilities.</b> Print-to-speech reading machines have made mainstreaming feasible for the visually impaired. Speech recognition devices are enabling the hands-impaired to use word processors, interact with computers, and control their environments. In a few years, we will see the first generation of listening machines for the deaf that will provide a text display of what people are saying.</p>
<p>Finally, <b>technology</b><b> broadens the scope of the teacher by reducing the need for specific </b><b>knowledge</b><b> and expertise.</b> The traditional model of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> presents the teacher as the repository of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> who imparts his or her erudition. This limits the students (not to mention the teacher) to a narrow body of subject <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. With appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the teacher plays a different role, that of a sociable adult who provides a cultural and social <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. The teacher does not need to be an expert in every topic, but is rather a mature guide who learns along with his students.</p>
<p>If you visit today's elementary and secondary schools, you will see a motley collection-of old trailing-edge computers. Seymour Papert, developer of LOGO, the principal educational <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_language_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, compares the specter of an entire classroom of children sharing one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to that of one classroom sharing one pencil. One pencil, according to Papert, is probably better than none, but it is not likely to lead to a "pencil revolution."</p>
<p>With a presidential campaign year ahead, we are likely to hear a lot about the importance of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. But rhetoric won't improve our schools. Our international competitors really do take <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> seriously. They invest more than we do, in both the old and the new, and the results show it. By the time it is fully apparent that our kids have emerged unprepared onto the world scene, it will be too late.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Mr. Kurzweil's prescience makes this a wonderfully nostalgic article for a college student.
<br>
<br>
He hadn't been influenced yet by the peer to peer phenomena, but he probably now knows about the emergence of undergraduate file archives(www.dswap.com), and the impact these will have upon the collegiate meme pool.  Students building upon the research of other students--this not a new idea, but we are still unaware that pregraduate kids are capable of acting as information synthesizers, rather than merely consumers.  There are far too many questions to ask to rely on the snail's pace of traditional academia!
<br>
<br>
I predict that flow will become central to educational theory through the adoption of a methodology of cognitive ergonomics.  Flow is the teleological underpinning of any computer interface. Similarly, it alone indicates optimal educational experiences--within a digital environment or among the traditional interaction of people.  Lets turn our heads towards adaptive interface intelligence (AII)and the impact it will have in facilitating skill assessment, acquisition, and educational flow states.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>One thing Kurzweil seems to overlook in his view of learning is that language and learning are skills.  Language is the medium by which we learn.  We get better at doing it by doing it.  What most computer learning programs do today is drill the student in certain exercises that provide lots of practice but don't improve skill.
<br>
<br>
Take tennis, for example.  Just hitting the ball over the net again and again will not make a person a good tennis player.  What's more, we shouldn't expect everyone who gains the skill of tennis to be a contender for the U.S. Open.  What a really good tennis player learns is how to read an opponent and anticipate what he/she is going to do and then come up with an answer for that challenge.  And that's what one must practice to become a really good player.  Hitting the ball over the net is just a basic skill that is taken for granted as a bare minimum of ability.  
<br>
<br>
The great player is able to come up with new challenges that his opponent doesn't expect and can't anticipate.  And that, I think, is what great teaching must do.  It must challenge the student to rise to his highest skill level and then go beyond that to reach a new level he never anticipated.  And we must not put down the students who fail to achieve this level.  Only the best will be able to do it.  Not everybody is going to be the best -- that would negate the meaning of the word.  
<br>
<br>
But the challenge and the act of overcoming that challenge is what drives the student to be all he/she can be.  The videogame player or tennis player doesn't become great for the money they might earn.  They do it because it feels good to rise to the challenge.  If there is no challenge, as there seldom is in most educational software, there is no motive to improve and no reward for doing so.  It's the job of the program to provide that challenge.  The teacher can provide a suitable reward.
