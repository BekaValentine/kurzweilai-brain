<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published as an academic paper on August 15, 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net September 18, 2001.</p>
<p>Some years ago a friend of mine in the Peace Corps told me about his efforts on behalf of a tribe of gentle Indians deep in the Brazilian forest. I asked him if he had been required to tell them about the conflict between the USA and the USSR. Not at all, he replied. There would be no point in it. They had not only never heard of either America or the Soviet Union, they had never even heard of Brazil! Who would have guessed that it is still possible to be a human being living in, and subject to the laws of, a nation without the slightest <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of that fact? If we find this astonishing, it is because we human beings, unlike all other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, are <i>knowers</i>. We are the ones--the <i>only</i> ones--who have figured out what we are, and where we are, in this great <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. And we are even beginning to figure out how we got here.</p>
<p>These quite recent discoveries are unnerving, to say the least. What you are--what each of us is--is an assemblage of roughly a trillion cells, of thousands of different sorts. Most of these cells are "daughters" of the egg and sperm cell whose union started you (there are also millions of hitchhikers from thousands of different lineages stowed away in your body), but each cell is a mindless mechanism, a largely autonomous micro-robot, no more conscious than a bacterium, and not a single one of the cells that compose you knows who you are, or cares.</p>
<p>Each trillion-robot team is gathered together in a breathtakingly efficient regime that has no dictator but manages to keep itself organized to repel outsiders, banish the weak, enforce iron rules of discipline--and serve as the headquarters of one conscious self, one mind. These communities of cells are fascistic in the extreme, but <i>your</i> interests and values have almost nothing to do with the limited goals of the cells that compose you--fortunately. Some people are gentle and generous, others are ruthless; some are pornographers and others devote their lives to the service of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, and it has been tempting over the ages to imagine that these striking differences must be due to the special features of some <i>extra</i> thing (a soul) installed somehow in the bodily headquarters, but what we now have figured out is that there is no such extra ingredient; we are each <i>made</i> <i>of</i> mindless robots and nothing else, no non-physical, non-robotic ingredients at all. The differences between people are all due to the way their particular robotic teams are put together, over a lifetime of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. The difference between speaking French and speaking Chinese is a difference in the organization of the working parts, and so are all the other differences of personality--and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>Four and a half billion years ago, the earth was formed, and it was utterly without life. And so it stayed for perhaps as long as a billion years. For another billion years, the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>'s oceans teemed with life, but it was all blind and deaf. Simple cells multiplied, engulfing each other, exploiting each other in a thousand ways, but oblivious to the world beyond their membranes. Then much larger, more complex cells evolved--eukaryotes--still clueless and robotic, but with enough internal machinery to begin to specialize. So it continued for more than two billion more years, the time it took for the algorithms of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to hit upon good ways of banding these workers together into multi-cellular organisms composed of millions, billions and, (eventually) trillions of cells, each doing its particular mechanical routine, but now yoked into specialized service, as part of an eye or an ear or a lung or a kidney. These organisms (not the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> team members composing them) had become <i>long-distance</i> knowers, able to spy supper trying to appear inconspicuous in the middle distance, able to hear danger threatening from afar. But still, even these whole organisms knew not what they were. Their instincts guaranteed that they tried to mate with the right sorts, and flock with the right sorts, but just as those Brazilians didn't know they were Brazilians, no buffalo has ever known it's a buffalo.</p>
<p>In just one <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, a new trick evolved: <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. It has provided us a broad highway of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-sharing, on every topic. <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">Conversation</a> unites us, in spite of our different languages. We can all know quite a lot about what it is like to be a Vietnamese fisherman or a Bulgarian taxi driver, an eighty-year-old nun or a five-year-old boy blind from birth, a chess master or a prostitute. No <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how different from one another we people are, scattered around the globe, we can explore our differences and communicate about them. No <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how similar to one another buffalos are, standing shoulder to shoulder in a herd, they cannot know much of anything about their similarities, let alone their differences, because they can't compare notes. They can have similar experiences, side by side, but they really can't share experiences the way we do.</p>
<p>Even in our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, it has taken thousands of years of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> for us to begin to find the keys to our own identities. It has been only a few hundred years that we've known that we are mammals, and only a few decades that we've understood in considerable detail how we have evolved, along with all other living things, from those simple beginnings. We are outnumbered on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> by our distant cousins, the ants, and outweighed by yet more distant relatives we share with the ants, the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, but though we are in the minority, our <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for long-distance <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> gives us powers that dwarf the powers of all the rest of the life on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. Now, for the first time in its billions of years of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> is protected by far-seeing sentinels, able to anticipate danger from the distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>--a comet on a collision course, or <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>--and devise schemes for doing something about it. The <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> has finally grown its own nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>: us.</p>
<p>We may not be up to the job. We may destroy the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> instead of saving it, largely because we are such free-<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, creative, unruly explorers and adventurers, so unlike the trillions of slavish workers that compose us. Brains are for anticipating the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, so that timely steps can be taken in better directions, but even the smartest of beasts have very limited time horizons, and little if any ability to imagine alternative worlds. We human beings, in contrast, have discovered the mixed blessing of being able to think even about our own deaths and beyond, and a huge portion of our <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> expenditure over the last ten thousand years or so has been devoted to assuaging the concerns provoked by this unsettling new vista. If you burn more calories than you take in, you soon die. If you find some tricks that provide you a surplus of calories, what might you spend them on? You <i>might</i> devote person-centuries of labor to building temples and tombs and sacrificial pyres on which you destroy some of your most precious possessions--and even some of your very own children. Why would you want to do <i>that</i>? These strange and awful expenditures give us clues about some of the hidden costs of our heightened powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. We did not come by our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> painlessly.</p>
<p>Now what will we do with our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>? The birth-pangs of our discoveries have not subsided. Many are afraid that <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> too much about what we are--trading in mystery for mechanisms--will impoverish our vision of human possibility. This fear is ill-considered. Look around at those who are eagerly participating in this quest for further <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and embracing the new discoveries; they are manifestly not bereft of <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a>, moral conviction, engagement in life, commitment to <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. In fact, if you want to find anxiety, despair, <i>anomie</i> today, look among the undereducated young people scavenging their dimly understood heritages (or popular culture) for a comfortable <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>. Among intellectuals, look to the fashionable tribe of postmodernists, who would like to suppose that modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is just another in a long line of myths, its institutions and expensive apparatus just the rituals and accouterments of yet another <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>. That intelligent people can take this seriously is a testimony to the power that fearful <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> still has, in spite of our advances in self-<a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. The postmodernists are right, of course, that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is just one of the things we might want to spend our extra calories on. The fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has been the major source of the efficiencies that created those extra calories does not <i>entitle</i> it to any particular share of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> it has created. But it still ought to be obvious that the methods and rules of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>--not just its microscopes and telescopes and computers--are the new sense organs of our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, enabling us to answer questions, solve mysteries, and anticipate the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> in ways no earlier human institutions can approach. The more we learn about what we are, the more options we will discern about what to try to become. We Americans have long honored the "self-made man" but now that we are actually <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> enough to be able to re-make ourselves into something new, many flinch. Many people would apparently rather bumble around with their eyes closed, trusting in tradition, than look around to see what's about to happen. Yes, it is unnerving; yes, it can be scary. After all, there are many entirely new mistakes we are now empowered to make. But it's the beginning of a great new adventure for our knowing <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>--and much more exciting, as well as safer, if we open our eyes.</p>

<br>
this link http://www.collectiveintelligence.net/weblog.htm
<br>
 is the end of a strange, excruciating email thread i've been having with this american expat in hong kong who actually used to run the net market makers' chapter there. i think it sums up what i believe to be both right and politically expedient about our current political situation. unlike my wife, the vicar, i don't count on virtue, but try to set up systems where peoples' innate self interest accomplishes my aims. 
<br>
<br>
i think i have a political alternative that supports justice for the palestinians, gays and lesbians and empowered women in the u.s. and still accomplishes what i consider to be the necessary military/political/police action aims of minimizing the threat that my family will be blown up. 
<br>
<br>
again, my tactics are not based on conversion, or requiring anyone to be act in a way other than in accord with their own self interest while conversion, redemption, and being called to something better, higher, etc. sometimes happens, i have always found i can rely on self interest in most situations. it's worked in business. why not in geopolitics?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Self interest is a big part of what the fanatics are fighting against.  It's called a sin.  To join their club, you must give up all earthly desire and be willing to die for what you believe in.  The Taliban has even banned kite flying!  They want their people to have no self interest whatsoever.  Christians have used this tactic for a couple of thousand years now.  The priest cannot marry, must take a vow of poverty, and devote his life to what the church sees as the will of God.  Nuns and lay brothers follow pretty much the same course.  
<br>
<br>
Lack of self interest is the essence of most religious beliefs.  Buddhist teachers say desire is the root cause of all suffering and pain.  They say the road to nirvana starts with getting rid of it.  So while self interest will work with the average man and woman in society at large, the fanatic will be immune to it and will consider it part of what he is giving up his life to destroy.  
<br>
<br>
Look at the symbols the hijackers were trying to bring down.  The twin towers were symbols of excess in almost every sense of the word.  They were the tallest buildings in the richest country and contained some of the biggest players in a world of finance and monetary excess. 
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the religious fanatics are the ones we are trying to stop. </p></td>

Worldwide, a huge amount of knowledge is accumalating, at an expediential rate through plain old person to person communication. What is even better? The internet. It's an amazing medium for our knowledge sharing connections to come together even more quickly, and across even further distances. World-Neurons connect!!
