<div class="TeaserText">Vernor Vinge's Hugo-award-winning short science fiction story "Fast Times at Fairmont High" takes place in a near future in which everyone lives in a ubiquitous, wireless, networked world using wearable computers and contacts or glasses on which computer graphics are projected to create an augmented reality.

<p><i>Originallly published in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090809134702/http://www.extropy.org/ideas/journal/current/2002-04-02.html" target="_blank">Extropy</a> 
              April 2002. Published on KurzweilAI.net Sept. 5, 2002</i></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090809134702/http://www.kurzweilai.net/bios/bio0007.html" target="_top">Vernor Vinge</a>'s short 
              story "Fast Times at Fairmont High" won the 2002 Hugo 
              award in the Novella category. It appears in his recently published 
              story collection called <i>The Collected Stories of <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a></i>. 
              It's a somewhat expensive collection so I know most people won't 
              have read the story yet, but I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> I'd make some comments about 
              it here. </p>
<p>"Fast Times" obviously takes its title from the popular 
              movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but it's a little misleading 
              because actually the story is about junior high kids. It's <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in 
              the 2020s, I think -- a difficult era for authors to write about 
              because the world needs to be significantly different from our own, 
              but still recognizably grown from our world. (The year is not stated, 
              but one character's grandfather grew up in the 1980s, which would 
              suggest that the father grows up in the 2000s, and this kid is about 
              14 so it should be the late 2020s.)</p>
<p>I wasn't impressed by the plot. Too much <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is spent with the 
              kids wandering around in the nighttime fog at Torrey Pines State 
              Beach, making a surprising and rather unlikely discovery (which 
              I won't give away here, because it would spoil the plot, such as 
              it is). However the technological milieu is fascinating and is the 
              true appeal of the story. Also the grounding of the story in actual 
              San Diego County locations (where Vinge lives) adds some local color 
              which I enjoyed. My wife lived in San Diego when we were first going 
              together, and I used to travel down there to visit her.</p>
<p>Vinge indicates that he hopes to expand the story into a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>, 
              and that sounds like a great idea. The story is really more of a 
              peek into the "fast times" of the 2020s, much as "The 
              Blabber" (also in the collection) gives a very abbreviated 
              picture of the Zones of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a>. A weak story led to a great <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>, 
              and the same thing could happen with "Fast Times".</p>
<p>So what is <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> like in Vinge's 2020?</p>
<p>The biggest technological change involves <a class="thought" href="entries/ubiquitous_computing_entry.html">ubiquitous computing</a>, 
              wearables, and augmented <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> (although none of those terms are 
              used). Everyone wears contacts or glasses which mediate their view 
              of the world. This allows <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics to be superimposed on 
              what they see. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s themselves are actually built into 
              the clothing (apparently because that is the cheapest way to do 
              it) and everything communicates <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly. Scientific American 
              had an article about this.</p>
<p>In Vinge's hands this is an astonishingly powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. 
              Remember the mediatrons from Diamond Age, where any surface could 
              be turned into a display? You have the same thing here, except it's 
              all in the eye of the beholder, so to speak. If you want a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              display, it can appear in thin air, or be attached to a wall or 
              any other surface. If people want to watch TV together they can 
              agree on where the screen should appear and what show they watch. 
              When doing your work, you can have screens on all your walls, menus 
              attached here and there, however you want to organize things. But 
              none of it is "really" there.</p>
<p>It goes beyond this. Does your house need a new coat of paint? 
              Don't bother, just enter it into your public <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> and you have 
              a nice new mint green paint job that everyone will see. Want to 
              redecorate? Do it with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics. You can have a birdbath 
              in the front yard inhabited by Disneyesque <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s who frolic and 
              play. Even indoors, don't buy artwork, just <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> it from the 
              net and have it appear where you want. You can change your decor 
              theme instantly.</p>
<p>These kids are teenagers. Got a zit? No need to cover up with Clearsil, 
              just erase it from your public face and people will see the improved 
              version. You can dress up your clothes and hairstyle as well.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone can turn off their enhancements and see the plain 
              old <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, but most people don't bother most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> because 
              things are ugly that way.</p>
<p>Augmented <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> automatically produces sight-and-sound virtual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. Some of the kids attending Fairmont Junior High do so remotely. 
              They appear as "ghosts", indistinguishable from the other 
              kids except that you can walk through them. They go to classes and 
              raise their hands to ask questions just like everyone else. They 
              see the school and everyone at the school sees them. Instead of 
              visiting friends, the kids can all instantly appear at one another's 
              locations.</p>
<p>They even have tactile VR <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, but you have to buy special 
              clothes with "gaming stripes", whatever those are.</p>
<p>A related <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is the localizer <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. These are small, 
              inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> relay nodes that are scattered about, solar 
              and battery powered. Each one sets up connections to the local nodes 
              and provides for <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>. They also have some sensors, sight, 
              and sound apparently, which can enhance the augmented <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> synthesizing visual imagery is able to call on the 
              localizer <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> for views beyond what the person is seeing. In 
              this way you can have 360 degree vision, or even see through walls. 
              This is a transparent <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> with a vengeance!</p>
<p>The cumulative effect of all this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was absolutely amazing 
              and completely believable. It's as far beyond our current <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> as the net is beyond the telephone. It's very exciting to 
              imagine this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> coming into <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>.</p>
<p>Vinge has other technological changes that I found less convincing. 
              The biggest was an effective increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> due 
              to better <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> support. He has these junior high kids doing 
              Putman level math problems with ease, and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> in a couple of hours that the kid's father spent 3 years 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> is turned topsy turvy, with competence running 
              inversely with age. The adults are helpless compared to these junior 
              high kids, who themselves fear the fifth graders.</p>
<p>I didn't buy it. All the net connectivity and visual <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s don't 
              clearly add up to the kinds of improved competence Vinge is claiming. 
              One of the kids is using some <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> boosters but this didn't 
              add credibility for me because first, it comes out of nowhere as 
              far as grounding in our current scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and second, 
              most of the kids didn't use these but they were all expected to 
              master these skills.</p>
<p>One thing that was believable is that it seemed that a lot of the 
              kids cheated, and it was almost impossible for the adults to catch 
              them. With universal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> connectivity it would be hard to make 
              sure kids are doing their work on their own. I got the impression 
              the school sort of looked the other way, the idea being that as 
              long as the kids solved their problems, even if they got help via 
              the net, that was itself a useful skill that they would be relying 
              on all their lives.</p>
<p>Overall while I did not buy everything Vinge presented, it was 
              an astonishing glimpse at a near-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> world which is continuing 
              to go through revolutionary changes. Expanding the story to <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> 
              length should provide many more opportunities to develop techniques 
              that are only hinted at here.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The ongoing developments in neuroscience, technology &amp; body-hosted systems points in the very direction of Vinge's 'Fast Times.' 
<br>
<br>
A few quick cites of current science:
<br>
<br>
1. A mobile phone implanted in a molar. This is under development in England.
<br>
<br>
2. Rollable/foldable 'flat panel' video sheets/screens. Currently making the rounds at the expo/trade shows integrated into an eentsy teentsy 'Dick Tracy' watch/mobile videophone.
<br>
<br>
3. Inter-mind communications: A couple of years ago a group of researchers was able to display what a lab cat's visual cortex was 'seeing.' The researchers indicated this was a 'first try' and stated the results could be refined greatly. 
<br>
<br>
4. Remote stimulating of motor nerves: Currently being developed / tested.
<br>
<br>
5. Brain enhancements: 'Ratbots' are currently being deployed for the military that are guided by stimulation of their medial forebrain regions, inducing what the researchers described as 'nirvanna.' Orwellian/dystopian as well as utopian possibilities abound.
<br>
<br>
6. Electrode stimulation of the right angular gyrus in humans has been shown to lead to out of body experiences.
<br>
<br>
7. MRI 'treatments' of the brain have been shown to be able to 'turn off' an entire cerebral hemisphere and mitigate clinical depression. A wearable magnetic resonant 'hat' (not made of tin-foil...) is being developed (should go well with the Faraday baseball caps &amp; suits already available for sale on the web).
<br>
<br>
A coupla more mundane but eminently useful things that are already on the store shelves:
<br>
<br>
8. Ubiquitous solar chargers, low-power appliances: Go to the local Walmart and find thermo-electric refrigerators that cool/heat to 40 degrees below/above ambient temp and solar-rechargers for deer feeder batteries. 
<br>
<br>
9. White LED flashlights and white LED lighting arrays are coming to market (already red LEDs in the brake lights on late model cars.). As a result it's economical to live comfortably in remote exurbs w/out being hooked up to the grid. They almost never burn out, are rugged &amp; use very little electricity. 
<br>
<br>
10. Wireless broadband: Coming to a cable TV company near you, replete with wireless repeaters providing greater service areas.
<br>
<br>
11. Quantum technologies. Instantaneity via quantum entanglement - spooky action at a distance: Entangled systems can communicate with no wires required.
