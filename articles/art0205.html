<div class="TeaserText">Raymond Kurzweil created a hubbub with his idea that we will soon be able to "download" ourselves into machines and live forever. Find out what else he's got up his futuristic sleeve.</div>

<br><p>Originally published January 1, 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050227104856/http://www.technologyreview.com/magazine/jan00/qa.asp" target="_new">Technology Review</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 31, 2001.</p>
<p>Struggling to find <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in a busy schedule for yet another interview, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a> jokes that the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> frenzy surrounding him these days only happens "every thousand years." That's because the inventor and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> who brought us such products as the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> keyboard, a text-to-speech <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a> for the blind and voice-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is also one of the most audacious--and, some say, accurate--<a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s around. Kurzweil's fearlessly detailed predictions make his latest book, <i>The </i><i><a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i>, a must-read for the turn of the millennium.</p>
<p>
<i>TR</i> Associate Editor Rebecca Zacks visited Kurzweil at the Wellesley Hills, Mass., offices of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_technologies_entry.html">Kurzweil Technologies</a>, one of the half-dozen high-tech companies he has founded since selling his first major enterprise to Xerox in 1980. The son of a composer and trained as an MIT undergraduate in both <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> and creative writing, Kurzweil moves deftly from <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> processors and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. And though his manner and his gray pinstriped suit are remarkably subdued, his ideas about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> are explosive.</p>
<p>
<b>TR:</b> You're accomplished both as an inventor and as a writer--how do you see those two roles fitting together?</p>
<p>
<b>KURZWEIL:</b> In writing, you're also inventing. My main interest is to write about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, though I did write a health book. Lately, my interest in health has intersected with my interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, because they both have a bearing on the issues of longevity and <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>--keeping our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> bodies and brains healthy is the first bridge to <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. That'll bring us to the <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> revolution. Within 10 years, <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> will extend <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans at least a year every year. And that'll be the second bridge that'll bring us to the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> revolution, which gives us a real shot at <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. But writing about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is also an <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> process, because you have to invent the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to have a compelling statement about it.</p>
