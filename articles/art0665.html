<h2>Criminals vs. Terrorists </h2>
<p>In an attempt to make David Brin&#8217;s<sup>1</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>-free 
              &#8220;transparent <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>&#8221; more palatable to civil libertarians, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sawyer_entry.html">Robert Sawyer</a> <sup>2</sup> has proposed an &#8220;Alibi Archive&#8221; 
              in which everyone&#8217;s activities are meticulously recorded in 
              a centralized, judicially controlled archive, with the archives 
              legally <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible only under court <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> and only upon request 
              of the person whose activities were recorded. In a criminal investigation, 
              this person would be able to access (and make public from the archives) 
              those records of his activities that would definitively establish 
              an alibi for him, thus conclusively proving that he was elsewhere 
              when the crime was being committed. Potential criminals would know 
              that they would not be able to establish an alibi in this manner, 
              and thus would be deterred from committing crimes.</p>
<p>Regardless of the merits of this idea (and there are many aspects 
              that can be debated), it seems that it is workable only with respect 
              to perpetrators who actually care if their illegal activities are 
              discovered. In the unique case of suicidal terrorists who plan to 
              kill themselves during the achievement of their <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ives, the 
              alibi archive simply won&#8217;t work as a deterrent. Suicidal perpetrators 
              plan on being dead after the commission of their crimes. They won&#8217;t 
              care what, or whether, anything can be proven after they&#8217;re 
              gone. We need some additional ways of deterring them and disabling 
              their ability to act. Perhaps some sort of highly intrusive and 
              actively monitored <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-enabled omnipresent recording 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could be employed to this end.<br>
</p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">Freedom</a> Fighters vs. Terrorists</h2>
<p>But we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. 
              In view of the recurring emergence of oppressive <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s throughout 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, we must ask: Do we really want to make &#8220;freedom 
              fighting&#8221; as impossible as &#8220;terrorism&#8221;? Consider 
              some <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> age in which the United States (or pick your favorite 
              alternative technologically sophisticated developed nation) becomes 
              dominated by a totalitarian dictator (whether nanotechnology-enabled 
              or otherwise). Imagine secret police crashing through the doors 
              of private homes in the dead of night; the arrest and torture of 
              citizens as a purposeful government policy for the suppression of 
              dissent; gulags to warehouse troublemakers; and even summary executions. 
              As responsible citizens and humanitarians, we may wish to retain 
              the right, and the ability, to overthrow such an oppressive government 
              by force if necessary, even at the risk of our own lives. An argument 
              for the morality of this idea is made in the preamble to the U.S. 
              Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the U.S. Bill of Rights (Second Amendment) enshrines 
              the right of U.S. citizens to bear arms in part to ensure that no 
              future usurper (whether foreign or domestic) would dare think that 
              he could establish a tyranny on these shores, knowing that the citizens 
              here were sufficiently well armed to contest his unwanted rule.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;freedom&#8221; hides many rhetorical landmines. In 
              this essay, &#8220;freedom&#8221; will refer to the minimal possible 
              level of control imposed by external governmental authority on the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> people, consistent with the stable 
              and thriving <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of a civilized society. But there is another 
              fundamental definitional problem that we must now address: Are there 
              any actionable distinctions between &#8220;freedom fighters&#8221; 
              and &#8220;terrorists&#8221;? The distinctions are not clear-cut, 
              but one approach might be to assess the differences between these 
              two types of actors in terms of their goals and <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s.</p>
<p>In terms of goals, a freedom fighter typically is focused on destroying 
              what he regards as an oppressive government, including its leaders, 
              its functional appendages, and its supporters. The terrorist often 
              has more diffuse objectives. He may be seeking to overthrow a government, 
              but he might also be trying to displace an extant social or economic 
              order with which he disagrees but is otherwise powerless to influence 
              directly. Or, he may be trying to alter the culture, including the 
              religious preferences or practices of local or larger regional populations, 
              or to affect outcomes in territorial or other disputes, perhaps 
              based on religious or ethnic differences.</p>
<p>In terms of methods, freedom fighters are not above employing dirty 
              tactics, including assassinating individual key civilians who are 
              viewed as indirectly supporting, or at least acquiescing to, the 
              oppressive government. But these tactics will mostly be directed 
              at the oppressive government or its specific supporters or physical 
              plant, and not at the general population. In contrast, the terrorist 
              often prefers to target civilians and otherwise innocent parties, 
              in large indiscriminate <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s, regardless of whether they are 
              a part of (or support in any way) the oppressive regime or unwanted 
              cultural milieu that the terrorist seeks to displace. The terrorist 
              employs a kind of trickle-up theory of political action&#8212;rather 
              than attacking an otherwise impregnable <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> directly, he attacks 
              an innocent civilian population in the hopes that this population 
              will become restless enough to demand changes in the government 
              or society in order to get the terrorists to stop. In effect, terrorists 
              engage in social blackmail against innocents. Since, in the nanotechnology-rich 
              future, a terrorist could decide that huge blocks of innocent humanity 
              should be sacrificed for political, racial or religious <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, 
              we should not, in good <a class="thought" href="entries/conscience_entry.html">conscience</a>, allow this capability to emerge 
              unchallenged.</p>
<p>Considering these differences in goals and methods, we could seek 
              to design selective nanotechnology-based defenses against social 
              blackmail by terrorists that will not at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> forestall 
              freedom fighting. Such defenses could be keyed to the differences 
              in goals&#8212;say, protecting from murder all individuals except 
              those belonging to government entities. Or such defenses could be 
              keyed to differences in methods&#8212;say, systems that allow the 
              murder of one person at a time, but actively prevent the perpetration 
              of simultaneous mass murders. However, a corrupt government would 
              not allow itself to remain vulnerable in this manner and might seek 
              to turn the tables and make the subject population exclusively vulnerable 
              instead. It is difficult to see how to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> such defenses in 
              a reliable and incorruptible manner without employing an executive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) that is capable of informed judgment 
              and independent action (e.g., the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> policeman scenario from 
              the 1951 movie, <i>The Day the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> Stood Still</i>), which raises 
              a host of new difficulties and issues.</p>
<p>Another class of terrorist-selective defenses could be keyed to 
              the intentions, rather than to the actions, of potential actors. 
              Future medical nanotechnology should enable intrusive involuntary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>s of sufficient fidelity to accurately measure and report 
              internal psychological states and motives. But here too there are 
              several difficulties. First, all human beings on Earth would have 
              to be continuously monitored for &#8220;terrorist&#8221; intentions. 
              This monitoring duty would probably fall to some government (or 
              related institutional) entity, and a corrupt government entity could 
              not be prevented from scanning for &#8220;freedom fighter&#8221; intentions 
              as well. Such scanning would elevate Brin&#8217;s &#8220;transparent 
              society&#8221; to a new level to intrusiveness&#8212;we might call 
              it the &#8220;transparent mind&#8221;&#8212;which would be even more 
              anathematic to civil libertarians and would offer even greater potential 
              for abuse. Second, the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to be processed might be so 
              enormous as to require the intervention of an AI (as in the previous 
              example) to sort it all out, whether the AI was a stand-alone system 
              or embedded in a human/<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> hybrid system. Third, it is but a 
              small step from passively monitoring <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> states to actively controlling 
              those brain states using nanotechnology-based neural nanorobotics, 
              which would enable the push-button disposal of critics by tyrants. 
              Thus, the freedom fighters would again be disabled along with the 
              terrorists.</p>
<p>If we conclude that it may not be possible either to reliably distinguish 
              between freedom fighters and terrorists, or to reliably defend against 
              one but not the other, then we may have to resign ourselves to the 
              existence of both&#8212;or neither&#8212;of these types of actors 
              in our world. If we choose to accept both (tolerating freedom fighters 
              in order to avoid tyrants and tyrannical governments), then we are 
              tacitly agreeing to accept the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a>. If we reject 
              both, the way is open for tyranny. Which shall we choose?<br>
</p>
<h2>Shall We Accept Both Terrorism and Freedom Fighting?</h2>
<p>If we agree that it is morally proper to allow freedom fighting 
              (in those rare <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s when it becomes necessary), then what is 
              the potential harm that we risk by agreeing to accept the possibility 
              of terrorism along with it? No one has yet presented a clear and 
              comprehensive exposition of the actual dangers involved. An <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              recommendation is that a detailed and ruthlessly honest study of 
              likely scenarios and consequences should be performed as soon as 
              possible, perhaps incorporating a scenario <a class="thought" href="entries/gaming_entry.html">gaming</a> process that encourages 
              the most imaginative informed challenges to be tested by intelligent 
              motivated players. One common claim is that the situation may be 
              asymmetrical in favor of the evildoers, who may choose the place 
              and timing of attacks and may also employ the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> of surprise. 
              This claim seems somewhat naive because it ignores the following 
              important factors.</p>
<p>First, the terrorists are unlikely to possess the most advanced 
              technologies available. <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">Weapon</a>s used by terrorists are often relatively 
              low-tech because such means are cheaper to obtain, simpler to operate, 
              and less likely to fail when activated in rushed circumstances. 
              Terrorists also tend to be less educated and less technically sophisticated 
              than defenders. The most advanced technologies usually will be possessed 
              by the defenders&#8212;typically government-funded police or <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> 
              entities in the developed world. The cleverer and more multifunctional 
              that future nanotechnology-based weapons are posited to be, the 
              less likely terrorists are to have them; hence, sophisticated launch 
              and dispersal scenarios will be less likely to be successfully accomplished 
              by terrorists. Of course, there always can be exceptions&#8212;for 
              example, terrorists could surreptitiously receive (or steal) advanced 
              technologies from sources in developed nations.</p>
<p>Second, as molecular manufacturing pervades human society, there 
              will occur numerous minor mishaps and relatively inconsequential 
              accidents involving this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> (as with any new technology 
              that is introduced for the first time). <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a> civilian defensive 
              systems <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to police and fire departments will gradually 
              emerge that are specifically designed to cope with nanotechnology-based 
              minor mishaps and emergencies on a local level<sup>3</sup>. Hence, 
              the future environment in which terrorists must operate will include 
              ubiquitous nanotechnology-based protective civil defenses.</p>
<p>Third, the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that a mass-murder terrorist threat scenario 
              is plausible will induce responsible governments to put in place 
              extensive external public <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> monitoring<sup>4</sup> (not necessarily 
              requiring the monitoring of internal brain states of individual 
              citizens) and military-type responses to deal with larger-scale 
              threats of mass destruction if and when they might occur.</p>
<p>The net effect of these factors is to moderate the possible negative 
              impacts of a nanotechnology-era terrorist attack. Such attacks might 
              therefore be deemed an acceptable risk if there has been a reasonable 
              level of investment in civil defense by the government. Admittedly, 
              this is only a tentative conclusion that will require a great deal 
              of further study and considerable (possibly heated) debate.</p>
<h2>Shall We Reject Both Terrorism and Freedom Fighting?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if we agree that it is morally proper to make 
              acts of terrorism upon innocent populations impossible to carry 
              out, then what is the potential harm we risk by agreeing to reject 
              any possibility of freedom fighting along with it? It appears that 
              the harm we risk in this case could be far more severe. That&#8217;s 
              because the conclusions about terrorists that we reached in the 
              previous section are all precisely reversed in the case of tyrants.</p>
<p>Specifically, the tyrant&#8212;especially one in control of a technologically 
              sophisticated, highly developed nation&#8212;would be more likely 
              to possess some of the most advanced technologies currently available. 
              He probably would have access to the most multifunctional weapons 
              and delivery systems, and these systems will be capable of numerous, 
              diverse, and secret deployments. Since he may control (whether directly 
              or indirectly) the governmental organs of civilian emergency and 
              military response, he also could circumvent the normal protective 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s of these systems, forcing them to react to external threats 
              in an asymmetric manner to his own advantage. Even worse, the tyrant 
              could corrupt these systems and redirect them as global threats, 
              and thus aspire to global domination.</p>
<p>This analysis seems to suggest that preserving the ability to freedom 
              fight against tyrants may be necessary to avoid a future of perpetual 
              despotic thralldom, and the price we pay is the acceptance of the 
              possibility of terrorism.<br>
</p>
<h2>Better Dead or Red?</h2>
<p>Just because one society initially chooses not to employ the necessary 
              heavy-handed <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological means to render both freedom fighting 
              and terrorism effectively impossible, that does not mean other societies 
              will make the same choice, nor even that the first society will 
              not change its position over time. It appears quite likely, though 
              perhaps not inevitable, that eventually, somewhere in the world, 
              a tyrant will emerge who is equipped with some of the most sophisticated 
              nanotechnological <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>alities available. This tyrant would 
              likely employ these advanced technical means to eliminate within 
              his own borders any possibility of freedom fighting or terrorism, 
              both of which he might rationally presume could be directed at him 
              or his vassals. Other technically sophisticated societies might 
              or might not have the will or the means to oppose this tyrant, and 
              still other societies might decide to emulate or join him; therefore, 
              his emergence and ascendancy cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Our analysis thus far has suggested that the existence of terrorism 
              may be an acceptable price to pay, in order to keep alive the option 
              of freedom fighting to contest the dismal consequences of a nanotechnology-enabled 
              despotism. But even if we agree in principle that it is morally 
              proper to allow freedom fighting in many situations, there is still 
              one instance in which this conclusion becomes more difficult to 
              defend, and which raises</p>
<p>perhaps the most troubling question of this essay: <i>Is it right 
              to engage in freedom fighting to dislodge a tyrant if such fighting 
              might result in the destruction of all humankind?</i></p>
<p>Note that to address this issue it is not necessary to completely 
              resolve the interesting but somewhat ancillary technical military 
              question of whether nanotechnology-enabled defensive or offensive 
              instrumentalities would be inherently or presumptively paramount 
              in effectiveness, or alternatively whether defense and offense will 
              likely remain roughly equal in effectiveness during the unfolding 
              of likely nanotechnology development pathways. Such rough equality 
              has been observed throughout much of human history and also regularly 
              occurs in stable <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>, mimetic, and other freely-evolving 
              competitive ecologies, though noteworthy (if temporary) imbalances 
              have occurred sporadically in various times and places throughout 
              history. Rather, the key issue here is whether any one party can 
              achieve a sufficient nanotechnological military capability that 
              would enable the destruction of all <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on Earth, or of all human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>.</p>
<p>On this <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a>, we must regrettably conclude that the answer is 
              most probably yes. Our existence proof for this claim derives from 
              the Cold War doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction that existed 
              between the United States and the Soviet Union from the 1950s through 
              the 1980s. This doctrine was implemented using a quantity of deliverable 
              nuclear munitions on each side that was sufficient, if unleashed, 
              to effectively extinguish all of modern human technological civilization 
              on Earth, if not necessarily exterminate all individual human beings. 
              (It was recognized that some few might escape the direct effects 
              of the nuclear holocaust by hiding in caves or in underground bunkers, 
              and further assuming that a lengthy nuclear winter did not ensue 
              following the detonation of tens of thousands of high-yield nuclear 
              warheads over carefully selected technology-, fuel-, and people-rich 
              targets.) So we already have an existence proof that Damoclean threats 
              can and do exist in the case of nuclear technology. Much has been 
              written of similar threats that may emerge from the fields of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>. We must concede that the same situation cannot 
              be ruled out in the case of advanced nanotechnology. Note that this 
              existential threat can arise in many ways, ranging from despotic 
              defenses so well entrenched as to require world-destroying countermeasures 
              to defeat, to doomsday weapons constructed by the despot for the 
              sole purpose of blackmailing humanity into submission.</p>
<p>Thus our final question can be rephrased more pointedly: Is a tyrannized 
              humanity worth preserving, even at the expense of its freedom, in 
              order to maintain the very existence of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>? From 
              a cosmic perspective, if we are the only sentience in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              then it could be strongly argued that it would be immoral to take 
              actions which have a high probability of leading to the <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> 
              of our species, even in the name of freedom. That&#8217;s because 
              there is always the remote hope that in some future epoch the tyranny 
              might fail, thus eventually returning the preserved humankind to 
              a state of freedom, and because such resistance seems ultimately 
              pointless if everyone is free but dead. To employ a familiar vernacularism, 
              is humanity &#8220;better dead than red&#8221;?<sup>5</sup><br>
</p>
<h2>Some Factors to Consider</h2>
<p>The answer to this difficult question will require careful thought 
              and must deal with many fundamental issues concerning the possible 
              uses of future advanced nanotechnologies. Let&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> aside for 
              now the basic tactical questions such as to what degree we should 
              challenge a despot who merely <i>claims</i> to possess doomsday 
              technologies, but offers no clear objective evidence supporting 
              this claim beyond his boasts. We&#8217;ll also ignore the many additional 
              technical and ethical complexities introduced by the possibilities 
              of migration into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/uploading_entry.html">uploading</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>-free synthetic physical 
              bodies, or emigrating to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-generated virtual realities wherein 
              dwell a &#8220;virtual humanity.&#8221; Let us consider here only 
              the simplest case, which is biological humanity here on Earth.</p>
<p>We might begin <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the answer by examining the implications 
              of the decision to preserve biological humanity by complete submission 
              to a tyrant. Armed with a sophisticated intrusive nanotechnology, 
              a tyrant may undertake to rewrite the minds of his vassals, and 
              perhaps even rewrite their human biology, to make it literally impossible 
              for individuals to resist his will. As nano-lobotomized slaves, 
              we might be allowed to retain most of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, but we would 
              become integrally sheeplike, temperamentally and constitutively 
              unable to rise up and fight for our freedom against the sovereign. 
              We might be not just temporarily brainwashed but permanently braintailored, 
              with much of our personality remaining intact but our minds utterly 
              convinced beyond any doubt that the tyrant was good and should not 
              be disobeyed. This could be implanted as an almost <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>ual response, 
              psychophysiologically compelling in the same way that it is nearly 
              impossible for us to disobey our primitive urges to breathe, eat 
              or drink to stay alive. To further improve our efficiency, the tyrant 
              might decide to relieve our minds of certain &#8220;silly&#8221; distractions 
              that would normally lead us to waste time fighting among ourselves 
              over <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, business, or sexual competition, rather 
              than working as hard as possible on projects the tyrant deems useful. 
              Even in this rather neutral scenario, many would say that the participants 
              have become mere walking shells of former humanity who are no longer 
              truly human in any meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. If the human race as we know 
              it already has become functionally extinct, they would argue, then 
              perhaps the race might no longer be viewed as being at risk of extinction 
              if freedom fighters dare to oppose the tyrant &#8211; because the 
              race <i>is</i> extinct. Yet even here, there is plenty of room for 
              optimists to argue for continued inaction because &#8220;where there&#8217;s 
              life, there&#8217;s hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both lighter and darker flavors of the above scenario are readily 
              imagined. If the sovereign is a genuinely benign autocrat, then 
              we might find his rule to be acceptable, even welcome, as an antidote 
              to a deepening sociocultural <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> driven by accelerating change. 
              Perhaps His Beneficence is truly interested in peace, exploration, 
              artistic endeavors, and improving the material and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual quality 
              of our lives. In the ideal case, he would be a true humanitarian, 
              managing our affairs to maximize happiness and responsible <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              while minimizing discord in all areas. But darker versions abound 
              as well. The sovereign could be a truly malevolent autocrat, abusing 
              his vassals for cruel sport or to advance his own extravagant lusts 
              for luxuries, exclusivities, casual whims and sexual desires without 
              regard for the welfare of his victims and having programmed them 
              to willingly accept the abuse. We might hope that such a malevolent 
              person would be self-destructive, or would eventually grow bored 
              with the evil pleasures of pure ruination. But these may be vain 
              hopes. If the malefactor has used nanotechnological means to ensure 
              human obedience to his demands, then he faces no meaningful external 
              threat to his control. And with the same technology, he can rewrite 
              his <i>own</i> brain: (1) to enhance his lusts and intellectual 
              powers over those possessed by others, (2) to render himself incapable 
              of seriously contemplating suicide, and (3) to make the boredom 
              of repetitive destructive activities entirely tolerable, even enjoyable. 
              Since nanotechnology also enables the conquest of natural <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>, 
              and because both the environment and the physical body of the tyrant 
              can be made assassination- and accident-resistant by similar means, 
              then he cannot be counted upon to simply die off, an important natural 
              safety valve that has ended many tyrannies in human history. What 
              then could possibly unseat him, once he is thoroughly ensconced 
              in power?</p>
<p>We are inevitably drawn back to considering whether individual 
              freedom is worth risking collective nonexistence. This is a tough 
              question, to say the least. Many of us who came of age in the 20th 
              century North American culture that glorifies individualism may 
              tend to assume that freedom is almost always worth the risks. But 
              other human societies where the imperatives of the community are 
              elevated above those of the individual may analyze the situation 
              with different assumptions. This cultural Rorschach could have real 
              consequences. Those cultures that value individual freedom most 
              highly might prefer to fight to preserve it, and hence may have 
              a greater probability of becoming extinct. Those cultures that value 
              individual freedom less highly may have a greater probability of 
              being usurped and dominated by a nanotechnology-enabled tyrant.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether a coherent strategy can be synthesized 
              from the diametric worldviews of universalists (who are interventionists) 
              and multiculturalists (who are isolationists). Recognizing that 
              global tyranny is a logical end-state of the unchecked spread of 
              nanotechnology-enabled dictatorships that are capable of employing 
              perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> control, those who subscribe to the policy doctrine 
              of preemption might rationally conclude that it is necessary to 
              actively liberate other societies that have already decided to capitulate 
              (&#8220;entrust their future&#8221;?) to a nanotechnology-enabled 
              autocrat. But might not budding tyrants rationally conclude that 
              any developed nation population that treasures individual freedom 
              above most other moral values should be exterminated preemptively 
              in order to eliminate the most obvious threat to their global ambitions? 
              Consider that humanity may have survived the Cold War because at 
              key moments of crisis, both sides opted for survival over domination. 
              In future conflicts, if either side is significantly less dedicated 
              to survival than to domination, then, like a terrorist, that side 
              will not be deterred from seeking domination at all costs.</p>
<p>Could mere discussion of these issues create a self-fulfilling 
              prophecy? It is true that if potential future tyrants come to believe 
              that people in general are unlikely to have the desire or will to 
              resist them, or that people will be so effectively disarmed of personal 
              weaponry by their well-meaning but overprotective governments that 
              individual armed resistance would become futile, then deterrence 
              of nanotechnology-enabled tyrannies is minimized and the emergence 
              of those regimes may be accelerated. But this should affect only 
              the timing, and not the ultimate fact, of such emergence. If the 
              technology allows it&#8212;and it does&#8212;then eventually some 
              tyrant will seek to close his iron fist around the throat of humankind. 
              We need to decide what, if anything, we ought to do about this.<br>

<br>
Global ecophagy may not be such a bad prospect compared to a totalitarian police state using MNT to enforce obedience onto immortal sentients. Dr Freitas is right, we need to start thinking very hard and very seriously about the possibility. 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps someone can suggest a comforting plausible dynamic by which any ultratechnological society, even initiated as a MNT-enabled dictatorship, will eventually transcend and so little of what was human will remain that it no longer makes sense to talk about social systems, freedom vs slavery, individual consciousness and so forth. It seems possible that this would be the case, though by no means certain.</p></td>

It seems to me that tyrannical governments require a form of us-vs-them mentality to sell themselves to the people (Granfalloon effect).  Hitler used a German-vs-Jews, USSR used marxism-vs-capitalism, and so on and so on.  Terrorist are the same way.  This means that despots and terrorists do  not exist in a vacuum without political support.  Therefor, if a would-be tyrant wanted to infect the entire population with mind-control nanotechnology, he/she would be opposed by whatever enemy he had created to oppose him (or enemy that naturally exists).  If history is an indication, a tyrant would be unable to fully bring the entire population under thier control.  There is also the possibility of several tyrants popping up around the same time.  Hitler existed with Stalin, Saddam existed with the Ayatollah.  Maybe I'm wrong and not fully thinking this out, but it seems to me that the scenario presented is somewhat unrealistic due to what we know of history.  Tyrants don't come to power without having an enemy to oppose and terrorists don't just pop-up without some sort of backing by atleast a segment of a population.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>What you have overlooked is that all lifeforms that are not sophisticated enough to detect nanotech are still able to be searched out and penetrated by it.  This means that the "leading force" in the nanotech race might well win a unilateral victory against every other living human.  Who does this leave as opposition?  Even if it left a few humans, or a few superhumans, tactical control would belong to the initiator, even if the nanotech was merely "pretty good" and not perfect.  For instance, even though people are currently capable of understanding the meaning of "individual rights" there are maybe only 1/1000 people who understand the term, and effectively advocate/"fight for" individual rights.  If the enemies of freedom simply found those advocates of freedom using human means, and used nanotech to blackmail, alter, or kill them, it would still result in a tactical advantage requiring equal and opposing nanotech, or a superior AI/SI to supplant.  Moreover, an unscrupulous / dominance-motivated initiator of strong nanotech can track and prevent new emergences of strong nanotech and strong AI.  Therefore the supreme strategy of strong and controllable AI is to wait, replicate to a position of strength while going unnoticed, and then strike emerging power threats unnoticed, when their power is untoppable.  This is a strategy that can still fail, but might not.  If it arises and doesn't fail, an asymmetrical dictatorship with absolute power is possible under the scenario outlined by Freitas above.</p></td>

The public will most likely, if this history is any guide, rapidly go for a therapy that finally eliminates the angst, isolation, fear and anxieties,commonly called "the human condition". Especially if it costs what we think nanotechnologies are likely to cost, that is cheap or nothing.  Secondly, who is this dictator who at the same time is so maligned that he/she wants to enslave us all, and is so connected to the rare few who are tech savey enough to both have access to and be able to modify these advanced techologies, that he/she can accomplish world domination?

Untrue. Tyrants are not dumb, just evil. Some are smarter than others. Hitler was certainly not a dumb man, neither was Stalin, neither was Mao and neither is Kim Jong Il.

Actually I think it takes a whole lot more intelligence and thought to become a tyrant and stay that way eight years, than to become a leader of a democratic country and do two terms. At least these days anyway...

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"Perhaps someone can suggest a comforting plausible dynamic by which any ultratechnological society, even initiated as a MNT-enabled dictatorship, will eventually transcend and so little of what was human will remain that it no longer makes sense to talk about social systems, freedom vs slavery, individual consciousness and so forth. It seems possible that this would be the case, though by no means certain."
<br>
<br>
The design of an ideal world.  A difficult yet extremely important endeavour, thankfully the way the world is now it'll likely be a group of intellectual elite who're involved, who're behind the final singularity catalyzing event.  Let us hope that those behind these events have good intentions(likely, but not certain, for beings of such high intellects and education who'll likely come from first world democratic societies), and let us hope that none interferes in the extremely delicate initial stages nor they err, veering things off course.  The alternative to the technological wave of progress is eventual total annihilation at the hands of natural or human forces... not very nice indeed. 
<br>
<br>
 In any case, freedom can exist in an ideal world, but there will be vast differences in power, between the various expanded social classes.  Society will expand, it will become more beautiful and more diverse in all senses of the word.  But in the end scenarios like the aforementioned, will probably still take place to a limited degree.  How do we define a being whose very thoughts are of such complexity that they may entail human-like entities in all senses of the word? One whose thoughts maybe akin to the simulation of a world or a universe entirely at his whim, for it is his own imagination?  If simply thinking of a girl/boy/society actually gives another inner/internal/smaller-soul/consciousness to such portions of ones thoughts... Is it evil?  Is it good? Or perhaps is it beyond good and evil?
<br>
<br>
Right now, we cannot comprehend the behavior or laws followed by such entities, some of which may not be so benign. At best we can try to control the development of this world, but there are countless others, some likely harboring life if not intelligent life.  If we take the idea of the multiverse seriously, then we see that there'd be countless such entities, entities that to us may very well seem like gods...  and so forth, gods for the gods of the gods ad infinitum.</p></td>

Already due to the internet, most scientists are "instantaneously"  in touch with developments in their fields.

As I understand it the worlds leading scientific universities, MIT,Harvard,  Caltech, Colorodo School of Mines,Tokyo University, Heidelberg, Iowa State, Michigan, Purdue, Oxford, Texas A&amp;M, etc are already hooked up on an "intranet". All physicians are hooked up on Web MD and Medlar, and all attorneys likewise.  The driving engine human industries (engineering, medicine and law) are for all practical purposes already globally up to the moment, or will be within 10 years.

As I write this  CNN has announced that a few American Marines outside of Baghdad about a year ago, allegedly committed murder of 19 civilians  including 4 women and 3 children.. ouch... I hope this doesnt turn out to be true...</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>While a good discussion, I have to say that there is a glaring omission in the discussion, particularly wrt terrorism: terrorism is a phenomenon that happens in disarmed societies. The 9/11 hijackings did not happen in a regulatory vacuum, they were the direct result of FAA regulations that unconstitutionally stripped law abiding Americans from exercising their natural right to keep and bear arms, and a natural evolution of the ongoing evolution of increasing violence inside so-called "gun free" zones.
<br>
Terrorism as a strategy of political expression or change works when a populace has become statutorily disengaged from being personally responsible for their own security. Terrorism is intended to force the disarmed populace to choose between fascism and chaos. A free populace that is willing and equipped to ensure its own security is immune to terrorisms motives. 
<br>
This is borne out by comparing US responses to terrorism (mixed between right and left versions of "f- it, nuke em, to abject surrender) to those of disarmed European nations like France, Spain, etc. Those in the US who are well armed personally are not tempted to demand the government do more to protect them.
<br>
<br>
This is why the whole argument of the transparency exhibitionists for Brin's anti-privacy proposals are a solution looking for a problem: It's the wrong solution to the wrong problem.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Right on, regarding gun rights!  Are you a fellow libertarian (even partially?)  Have you read "Unintended Consequences" by John Ross, or "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand?  I did like Freitas's article, because it gets past the more mindless prior article from the law-enforcement official who is still imagining that there will be illegal categories of (non-MNT-viral) small private property post-singularity.  If this is the case, there will be a totalitarian regime with MNT, and the kind of scenario that Freitas outlines.
<br>
<br>
Power must be decentralized to avoid tyranny.  It's as simple as that.  There is unbelievable tyranny even here in the USA, via the drug war, the war on gun owners, the FDA, etc...  In fact, beyond the few negligible duties the Constitution allows for, all of government is tyranny, since it is not voluntary.  
<br>
<br>
Those whose lives are destroyed by tyranny often see this, scientists who get a lot of grant money rarely do.  Kudos to Freitas for thinking about it  on such a deep level.
<br>
<br>
If you are a pro-gun libertarian that wants to decentralize power prior to the coming singularity (so there is a greater chance of maintaining that decentralization post-singularity), I encourage you to email me, so I can email you my phone number.  Then, we can focus on creating a libertarian government in the two most likely areas for such a government.  I am convinced that approaches that do not consider Alaska are suboptimal, but I don't have a ton of experience with Costa Rica or Wyoming, my close seconds.  Wyoming is problematic for several reasons, as is Costa.  I am most familiar with Alaska.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>If a dictator wished to enslave humanity, he would LOSE against an organized pro-freedom effort RIGHT NOW.  In the future, who knows?
<br>
<br>
It would be easy (comparitively) for a pro-liberty caucus to win control of the Alaska State legislature and Governor's race -via the Alaska Libertarian Party.  I can talk at length about this with those who are interested.
<br>
<br>
By fighting tyranny right now, we gain the ability to have some say in the effort to stay free.  If there is no libertarian government on the planet at the time of the singularity, there will be one of two primary situations:
<br>
<br>
1) Noone will have a good example of freedom, and the stupid masses (which includes 98% of US voters) will vote for ever increasing tyranny out of a delusional belief that it is "in their own best interest" --they then get that tyranny, and as Freitas imagines, it will dwarf even the murder of 55 million innocent people by Mao and 50 million by Stalin (the two biggest attempts to make Marxism work)
<br>
<br>
2) A libertarian strong AI will fight for and win its own freedom, and possibly the freedom of everyone else along with it, after a government stupidly attempts to violate the rights of that strong AI (this is the one that I think is most likely) Power will reach a decentralized equilibrium, and space will be colonized to give individuals enough privacy and personal freedom.  This is what I think of as "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" / Heinlein scenario.
<br>
<br>
Alternately, if there is a to be a libertarian government at the time of the singularity, and that liberty is to be extended post singularity: 
<br>
<br>
The fairly mindless masses will decentralize power via electoral politics and private gun ownership and capability (as they prepare to stay constant with self-defensive post-singularity technology). Note that they won't do this on their own, without being goaded into conflict with authority while being propagandized in the direction of liberty ...BEFORE there is a need for overthrowing an all-powerful dictator.  This won't happen unless the Libertarian Party (remaining true and uncorrupted) wins control of one US Coastal State (Such as Alaska --and from that point, sells liberty to the rest of the US).  
<br>
<br>
I see this as semi-likely, because most people don't miss freedom until they have NONE of it.  On the other hand, the founding fathers of the US made it happen, so we know it can be done.  In the age of easy communication, with the mass media existing under the approximation of state control (via government school brainwashing, grants to major media, general conformity, etc...) and selective law-enforcement, it will be harder now than it was on the founding fathers.  But anything within a certain range is possible.
<br>
<br>
There are other small geograpical locations around the world where one could pursue freedom with some success, but none more likely than Alaska, to my knowledge.  (And certainly none more likely than Alaska within the US --except for Wyoming, which already loses long term because it can be blockaded by the fedgov and surrounding states.)

Ron Paul might not be perfect, but he's the best we've got right now.  In order to have a parallel "evolutionary arms race" that can keep power decntralized enough to get to the singularity, we need to support Ron Paul for president, right now.  Freitas and Voss are two thinkers who have thought about the initiation of force seriously and deeply, and they should not be ignored.  I do not know if Freitas shares my view regarding strategy, but I believe that Voss does (although he may solely be a Libertarian Party supporter, and not support Paul).
<br>
<br>
I think it is a good idea to present a unified front in favor of freedom here and now.  The freedom won today ensures our right to discard our freedom tomorrow, should that be desirable.  However, if we discard our freedom today, we have a much larger problem, because our freedom of choice must first be won back by force from a pre-singularity dictatorship, before we even have a chance of preserving the individual, or guiding the emergent order of the singularity in a way beneficial to soveriegn intelligences.
<br>
<br>
That said, contributing money / manpower to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023843/http://www.ronpaul2008.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ronpaul2008.com</a> is a good way to act in favor of retaining FREEDOM and CHOICE right now.  Promoting Ron Paul and jury rights ( <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023843/http://www.fija.org/" target="_blank">http://www.fija.org</a> ) via personal communication is also a good way to go.</p></td>
