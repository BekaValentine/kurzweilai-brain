<div class="TeaserText">In this detailed response to John Searle's "Chinese Room" argument, Ray Kurzweil argues that Searle's reasoning is based on the na&#180;ve, unrealistic premise that nonbiological entities can only manipulate logical syntax, whereas the current trend is toward emergent self-organizing chaotic systems based on pattern recognition, biologically inspired massively parallel methods, and reverse-engineering the brain.  According to Kurzweil, Searle's belief that consciousness requires a neurobiological substrate is equally unsupported. "We will meet [nonbiological] entities in several decades that at least convincingly claim to be conscious," he concludes.</div>

<h2>Those Who Build <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>s are Doomed to Live in Them</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a> is popular among his followers for what they believe 
              is a staunch defense of the deep mystery of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              against trivialization by <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ists like <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>. 
              And even though I have always found Searle&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> in his celebrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument to be hopelessly tautological, even I had 
              expected him to articulate an elevating treatise on the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>es 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Thus it is with some surprise that I find Searle 
              writing statements such as:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>[H]uman brains cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> by a series of specific neurobiological 
                processes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The essential thing is to recognize that 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> process like digestion, lactation, 
                photosynthesis, or <a class="thought" href="entries/mitosis_entry.html">mitosis</a> . . . </p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to be sure, but 
                a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> all the same. So the first step is to figure out how 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does it and then build an artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that has 
                an equally effective mechanism for causing <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that brains cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> with specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
                mechanisms . . . </p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So who is being the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist here? Searle apparently expects 
              that we can measure the subjectivity of another <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> as readily 
              as we measure the <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> output of photosynthesis. </p>
<p>I will return to this central issue, but I also need to point out 
              the disingenuous <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of many of Searle&#8217;s quotations and 
              characterizations. For example, he leaves out critical words that 
              dramatically alter the meaning of a statement. For example, Searle 
              writes in his chapter in this book:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>[Ray Kurzweil] insists that they [the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s] will claim 
              to be conscious . . . and consequently their claims will be largely 
              accepted. People will eventually just come to accept without question 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are conscious. But this misses the point. I can already 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> so that it says that it is conscious&#8212;i.e., 
              it prints out &#8220;I am conscious&#8221;&#8212;and a good <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer 
              can even <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> it so that it will carry on a rudimentary argument 
              to the effect that it is conscious. But that has nothing to do with 
              whether or not it really is conscious.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Searle fails to point out that I make exactly the same point, and 
              further that I refer not to such idle claims that are easily feasible 
              today but rather to the convincing claims of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. As 
              one example of many, I write in my book (p. 60) that these claims 
              &#8220;won&#8217;t seem like a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med response. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will 
              be earnest and convincing.&#8221; </p>
<p>Searle writes that I &#8220;frequently cite IBM&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> 
              as evidence of superior <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.&#8221; The 
              opposite is the case: I cite <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> to (p. 289) &#8220;examine 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and [contemporary] <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> approaches to <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> . . . not 
              to belabor the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, but rather because [they] <i>illustrate 
              a clear contrast</i>.&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> follows a very different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. Solutions emerge in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from the unpredictable 
              interaction of millions of simultaneous self-organizing chaotic 
              processes. There are profound advantages to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>: 
              we can recognize and respond to extremely subtle <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. But we 
              can build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s the same way. </p>
<p>Searle states that my book &#8220;is an extended reflection of the 
              implications of Moore&#8217;s Law.&#8221; But the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
              of computing power is only a small part of the story. As I repeatedly 
              state, adequate <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power is a <i>necessary but not sufficient 
              condition</i> to achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Searle essentially 
              doesn&#8217;t mention my primary thesis: We are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to organize 
              these increasingly formidable resources by <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself. By examining brains in microscopic detail, we 
              will be able to recreate and then vastly extend these processes. 
              As I point out below, we have made substantial <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in this 
              endeavor just in the brief period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> since my book was published. 
            </p>
<p>Searle is best known for his &#8220;Chinese Room&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> and 
              has presented various formulations of it over twenty years (see 
              below). His descriptions illustrate a failure to understand the 
              essence of either <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes or the <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> processes 
              that could replicate them. Searle starts with the assumption that 
              the &#8220;man&#8221; in the room doesn&#8217;t understand anything 
              because, after all, &#8220;he is just a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>,&#8221; thereby illuminating 
              Searle&#8217;s own bias. Searle then concludes&#8212;no surprise&#8212;that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> doesn&#8217;t understand. Searle combines this tautology 
              with a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> contradiction: The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> doesn&#8217;t understand 
              Chinese, yet (according to Searle) can convincingly answer questions 
              in Chinese. But if an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>&#8212;biological or otherwise&#8212;really 
              doesn&#8217;t understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, it will quickly be unmasked 
              by a competent interlocutor. In addition, for the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to convincingly 
              respond, it would have to be as complex as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The observers 
              would long be dead while the man in the room spends millions of 
              years following a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> billions of pages long. </p>
<p>Most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, the man is acting only as the central processing 
              unit, a small part of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. While the man may not see it, the 
              understanding is distributed across the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              itself and the billions of notes he would have to make to follow 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. <i>I understand English, but none of my <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s do</i>. 
              My understanding is represented in vast <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> 
              strengths, synaptic clefts, and interneuronal connections. Searle 
              appears not to understand the significance of distributed <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and their emergent properties. </p>
<p>Searle writes that I confuse a simulation for a recreation of the 
              real thing. What my book (and chapter in this book) actually talk 
              about is a third category: functionally equivalent recreation. He 
              writes that we could not stuff a pizza into a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation 
              of the stomach and expect it to be digested. But we could indeed 
              accomplish this with a properly designed artificial stomach. I am 
              not talking about a mere &#8220;simulation&#8221; of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              as Searle construes it, but rather functionally equivalent recreations 
              of its causal powers. As I pointed out, we already have functionally 
              equivalent replacements of portions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to overcome such 
              disabilities as deafness and Parkinson&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. </p>
<p>Searle writes: &#8220;It is out of the question . . . to suppose 
              that . . . the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is conscious.&#8221; Given this assumption, 
              Searle&#8217;s conclusions to the same effect are hardly a surprise. 
              Searle would have us believe that you can&#8217;t be conscious if 
              you don&#8217;t possess some specific (albeit unspecified) <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              process. No entities based on functionally equivalent processes 
              need apply. This <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>-centric view of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is likely 
              to go the way of other <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-centric beliefs. In my view, we cannot 
              penetrate the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive 
              measurement, which is why many classical <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, including Searle&#8217;s 
              materialist approach, quickly hit a wall.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/intuitive_linear_view_entry.html">Intuitive Linear View</a> Revisited</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Searle&#8217;s slippery and circular arguments aside, <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> 
              entities, which today have many narrowly focused skills, are going 
              to vastly expand in the breadth, depth, and subtlety of their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>. Early in his chapter, Searle makes clear his discomfiture 
              with the radical <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the twenty-first century technologies 
              that I have described and their impact on <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. Searle clearly 
              expects the twenty-first century to be much like the twentieth century, 
              and considers any significant deviation from present norms to be 
              absurd on their face. Not once, but twice he expresses incredulity 
              at the notion of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_sex_entry.html">virtual sex</a>, for example: &#8220;The section on 
              prostitute is a little puzzling to me. . . . But why pay, if it 
              is all an electrically generated fantasy anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Searle obviously misses the point of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> 
              is not fantasy; it is a <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> medium between two or more 
              people. We already have auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>; it&#8217;s called 
              the telephone. Indeed, that is exactly how the telephone was viewed 
              when it was introduced in the late nineteenth century. People found 
              it remarkable that you could actually &#8220;be with&#8221; someone 
              else, at least as far as the auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> was concerned, despite 
              the fact that you were geographically disparate. And indeed we have 
              a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> over phone lines, not very satisfying to many perhaps, 
              but keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> it involves only one <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organ. The <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, 
              however, is just this: two people communicating, and in some cases 
              one of those persons may be paid for their services. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> 
              to provide full immersion visual shared environments is now being 
              developed, and will be ubiquitous by the end of this decade (with 
              images written directly to our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s by our eyeglasses and contact 
              lenses). Then, in addition to talking, it will really appear like 
              you are with that other person. As for touching one another, the 
              tactile <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> will not be full immersion by the end of this decade, 
              but full immersion virtual shared environments incorporating the 
              auditory, visual, and tactile senses will become available by around 
              2020. The design of such <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can already be described. When 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> becomes feasible around 2030, then

              among the most puzzling to him. Clearly Searle&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about

<p></p>
<p>Beyond Searle&#8217;s circular, tautological, and often contradictory 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing, he essentially fails to even address the key points in 
              my chapter and my book, so it is worthwhile reviewing my primary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing in my own words. My message concerns the emergence early 
              in the next century of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities with enormously powerful 
              intellectual skills and abilities and the profound impact this will 
              have on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. The primary themes are:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>(1) The power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> per unit cost is growing 
                exponentially. This has been true for the past one hundred years, 
                and will continue well into the next century. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) New <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> technologies such as nanotube-based <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, 
                which allow three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s to be constructed, 
                are already working in laboratories. Such three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s 
                will ultimately provide physically small <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that vastly exceed 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al ability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) In addition to <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, there is comparable exponential 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> modeling, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and many other 
                areas. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(4) Sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power by itself is not enough. Adequate 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al (and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>) resources are a necessary but 
                not sufficient condition to match the breadth, depth, and subtlety 
                of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capabilities. The organization, <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, and embedded 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of these resources (i.e., the &#8220;software&#8221; of 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>) is also critical.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(5) A key resource for understanding and ultimately recreating 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself. By probing 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, we are already <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> its <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. We are already 
                applying these types of insights (e.g., the front-end sound-<a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> 
                transformations used in <a class="thought" href="entries/automated_speech_rec_entry.html">automatic speech recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are 
                based on early auditory processing in <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian brains). The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
                is not invisible to us. Our ability to scan and understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
                neural functioning both invasively and noninvasively is scaling 
                up exponentially. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(6) We have already created detailed replications of substantial 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters. These replications (not to be confused with the 
                simplified mathematical models used in many contemporary &#8220;neural 
                nets&#8221;) recreate the highly parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> functions 
                of these <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters, and such efforts are also scaling up 
                exponentially. This has nothing to do with manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s, 
                but is a detailed and realistic recreation of what Searle refers 
                to as the &#8220;causal powers&#8221; of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters are certainly complicated, but their 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is not beyond our ability to understand and recreate 
                using other mediums. I cite specific recent <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> below. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(7) We&#8217;ve already shown that the causal powers of substantial 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters cannot only be recreated, but actually placed 
                in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to replace disabled <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> portions. These are 
                not mere simulations, but functionally equivalent recreations 
                of the causal powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(8) With continuing exponential advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> modeling, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning and understanding, it 
                is a conservative statement to say that we will have detailed 
                models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and complete maps of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> within 
                thirty years that enable us to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er its organization 
                and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>. This is no more startling a proposition than was 
                the proposal to scan the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 14 years ago. Well 
                before that, we will have <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> with the requisite 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to replicate its causal powers. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
                power, together with an understanding of the organization and 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> gained through such <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
                efforts, will be a formidable combination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(9) Although contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can compete with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
                in narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, diagnosing blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> images, 
                recognizing land terrain images in a cruise missile, making financial 
                investment decisions), their overall <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> lacks the subtlety 
                and range of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Compared to humans, today&#8217;s 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s appear brittle and formulaic. But contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
                are still a million times simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The depth 
                and breadth of the behavior of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities will appear 
                quite different when the million-fold difference in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
                is reversed, and when we can apply powerful models of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
                processes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(10) There are profound advantages to <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
                If I spend years <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> French, I can&#8217;t transfer that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
                to you. You have to go through a similar painstaking process. 
                We cannot easily transfer (from one person to another) the vast 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> strengths, synaptic clefts, and other

                leave out quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports in our <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> recreations 
                of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s will be able, therefore, to rapidly 
                share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>(11) Virtual personalities can claim to be conscious today, but 
                such claims are not convincing. They lack the subtle and profound 
                behavior that would make such claims compelling. But the claims 
                of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities some decades from now&#8212;entities

<p>Critical to my thesis is the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, 
              so it is worth commenting on recent <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in this area. Just

              but I will cite just one, which is a comprehensive model of a significant 
              portion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> auditory processing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a> 
              &lt;www.lloydwatts.com&gt; has developed from both <a class="thought" href="entries/neurobiology_entry.html">neurobiology</a> 
              studies of specific <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> types and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> interneuronal connection 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Watts&#8217; model includes more than a dozen specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> modules, five parallel paths and includes the actual intermediate 
              representations of auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> at each stage of neural

              which can locate and identify sounds with many of the same properties

              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> into working functionally equivalent recreations. Also, as

<a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ations require about 1,000 times less <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> than 
              the theoretical potential of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s being recreated.

              of hundreds of specialized regions. The process of &#8220;peeling 
              the onion&#8221; to understand these interleaved regions is well

              concentrates entirely on the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s used by <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>, which completely 
              misses the point. </p>
<p>Searle&#8217;s chapter is replete with misquotations. For example, 
              Searle states:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>So what, according to Kurzweil and Moore&#8217;s Law, does 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> hold for us? We will very soon have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that vastly 
              exceed us in <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Why does increase in computing power 
              automatically generate increased <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>? Because <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              according to Kurzweil, is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of getting the right formulas 
              in the right combination and then applying them over and over, in 
              his <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> &#8220;recursively,&#8221; until the problem is solved.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a completely erroneous reference. I repeatedly state that 
              increases in computing power do not automatically generate increased 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Furthermore, with regard to Searle&#8217;s reference 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a>, I present the recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> as only one technique 
              among many, and as a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> suitable only for a narrow class of 
              problems such as playing board games. I never present this simple 
              approach as the way to create <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. 
            </p>
<p>If you read Searle&#8217;s chapter and do not read my book, you 
              would get the impression that I present the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> used by Deep 
              Blue as the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. It makes 
              me wonder if Searle actually read the book, or just selectively 
              picked phrases out of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. I repeatedly contrast the recursive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> based <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              used by the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The field of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> represents 
              my own technical area of expertise. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> is 
              based on a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> in which solutions emerge from the interplay 
              of many interacting processes (see below). What I clearly describe 
              in the book is moving away from the formulaic approaches used by 
              many contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and moving towards the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. </p>
<p>Searle&#8217;s explanation of how <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> works is essentially 
              correct (thanks in large measure to my explaining it to him in response 
              to his urgent <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a> messages to me asking me to clarify for him 
              how <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> works). Although the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of rapidly 
              expanding move-countermove sequences is simple, the evaluation at 
              the &#8220;leaves&#8221; of this move-countermove tree (the scoring 
              function) is really the heart of the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>. If you have a simple 
              scoring function, then the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> is indeed simple and dependent 
              merely on brute force in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al speed. However, the scoring 
              function is not necessarily simple. <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>&#8217;s scoring function 
              uses up to 8,000 different features, and is more complex than most. 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> is able to consider billions of board situations and 
              creates an enormous tree of move-countermove possibilities. Since 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are so slow (at least ten million times slower 
              than <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s), we only have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to consider at most 
              a few hundred board positions. Since we are unable to consider the 
              billions of move-countermove situations that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> such as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> evaluates, what we do instead is to &#8220;deeply&#8221; 
              consider each of these situations. So how do we do that? By using 
              <i><a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a></i>, which is the heart of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              We have the ability to recognize situations as being similar to 
              ones we have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about previously. A <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> master such as Kasparov 
              will have mastered up to one hundred thousand such board situations. 
              As he plays, he recognizes situations as being similar to ones he 
              has <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about before and then calls upon his <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of those 
              previous <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s (e.g., &#8220;this is just like that situation 
              that I got into three years ago against grandmaster so-and-so when 
              I forgot to protect my trailing pawn . . .&#8221;).</p>
<p>I discuss this in my book in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to introduce a proposal to build 
              game-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in a new and hybrid way which would combine 
              the current strength of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (i.e., the ability to quickly sift 
              through a vast <a class="thought" href="entries/combinatorial_explosion_entry.html">combinatorial explosion</a> of move-countermove sequences) 
              with the more <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> which represents 
              at least a current superiority of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Basically, the 
              idea is to use a large (<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-based) neural net to replace the 
              scoring function. Prior to playing, we train that neural net on 
              millions of examples of real-world <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> playing (or whatever other 
              game or problem we are addressing). With regard to <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, we have 
              most of the master games of this century on-line, so we can train 
              this extensive neural net on every master game. And then instead 
              of just using an arbitrary <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules or procedures at the terminal 
              leaves (i.e., the scoring function), we would use this fully trained 
              neural net to make these evaluations. This would combine the combinatorial 
              approach with a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> approach (which, as I mentioned 
              above, is my area of technical expertise). </p>
<p>I proposed this to Murray Campbell, head of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> team, 
              and he was very interested in the idea, and we were going to pursue 
              it, but then <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> cancelled the <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> project. I may yet return 
              to the idea. Recently I brought up the idea again with Campbell. 
            </p>
<p>Searle completely misconstrues this discussion in my book. It is 
              not at all my view that the simple recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> 
              is exemplary of how to build flexible <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is that solutions 
              emerge from the chaotic and unpredictable interplay of millions 
              of simultaneous processes. And these <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> recognizers are themselves 
              organized in elaborate and shifting hierarchies. In contrast to 
              today&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is massively parallel, combines 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, and represents <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as highly distributed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s encoded in trillions of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> strengths. </p>
<p>A failure to understand that computing processes are capable of 
              being&#8212;just like the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brain&#8212;chaotic, unpredictable, 
              messy, tentative, and emergent is behind much of the criticism of 
              the prospect of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that we hear from Searle and 
              other essentially materialist philosophers. Inevitably, Searle comes 
              back to a criticism of &#8220;symbolic&#8221; computing: that orderly 
              sequential <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic processes cannot recreate true <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. I think 
              that&#8217;s true. </p>
<p><i>But that&#8217;s not the only way to build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, or <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              </i> </p>
<p>So-called <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (and part of the problem is the word &#8220;computer&#8221; 
              because <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can do more than &#8220;compute&#8221;) are not limited 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic processing. <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">Nonbiological</a> entities can also use the 
              emergent self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, and indeed that will be one great 
              trend over the next couple of decades, a trend well under way. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s 
              do not have to use only 0 and 1. They don&#8217;t have to be all 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> combines <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> techniques. 
              For example, California Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Professor Carver 
              Mead and others have shown that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can be built by combining 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s can be massively parallel. 
              And <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can use chaotic emergent techniques just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              does. </p>
<p>My own background is in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, and the primary computing 
              techniques that I have used are not <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> manipulation, but rather 
              self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s such as neural nets, <a class="thought" href="entries/markov_model_entry.html">Markov model</a>s, and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary (sometimes called genetic) <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that could really do what Searle describes in the Chinese 
              Room would not be merely &#8220;manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s&#8221; because 
              that approach doesn&#8217;t work. This is at the heart of the philosophical 
              slight of hand underlying the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> (but more about the Chinese 
              Room below). </p>
<p>It is not the case that the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of computing is limited to manipulating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s. Something is going on in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and there is 
              nothing that prevents these <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes from being reverse 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered and replicated in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities. </p>
<p>Searle writes that &#8220;Kurzweil assures us that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was 
              actually <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.&#8221; This is one of Searle&#8217;s many out-of-<a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> 
              quotations. The full quotation from my book addresses diverse ways 
              of viewing the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, and introduces my proposal for 
              building <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> in a different, more <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> way:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>After Kasparov&#8217;s 1997 defeat, we read a lot about 
              how <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was just doing massive <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> crunching, not really 
              &#8220;thinking&#8221; the way his <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> rival was doing. One could 
              say that the opposite is the case, that <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> was indeed <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              through the implications of each move and countermove; and that 
              it was Kasparov who did not have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to really think very much 
              during the tournament. Mostly he was just drawing upon his mental 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of situations he had <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about long ago. Of course, 
              this depends on one&#8217;s notion of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, as I discussed in 
              chapter three. But if the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> approach to chess&#8212;neural <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> 
              based <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> used to identify situations from a library 
              of previously analyzed situations&#8212;is to be regarded as true 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, then why not <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to work the same way? 
              The third way: And that&#8217;s my idea that I alluded to above as 
              the third school of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> in evaluating the terminal leaves in 
              a recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>. . . .</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, a comment on Searle&#8217;s view that the &#8220;real competition 
              was not between Kasparov and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, but between Kasparov and 
              a team of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers.&#8221; Both <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> and Kasparov 
              obtain input and modification to their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s and strategies 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> between games. But both <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> and Kasparov 
              use their internal <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s, strategies, and abilities to 
              play each game without any outside assistance or intervention during 
              the game. </p>

<h2>On Searle and his <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>s</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a> is probably best known for his <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument, 
              which adherents believe demonstrates that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> 
              entities) can never truly understand anything of significance (such 
              as Chinese). There are several versions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>, of 
              which I will discuss three. </p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> One: A Person and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> in a Room</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The first involves a person and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in a room. I quote here 
              from Professor Searle&#8217;s 1992 book: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>I believe the best-known argument against <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> was my Chinese 
                room argument (Searle 1980a) that showed that a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could instantiate 
                a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> so as to give a perfect simulation of some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to understand Chinese, even though 
                that <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> had no understanding of Chinese whatever. Simply imagine 
                that someone who understands no Chinese is locked in a room with 
                a lot of Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for answering 
                questions in Chinese. The input to the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> consists in Chinese 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s in the form of questions; the output of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> consists 
                in Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s in answer to the questions. We might suppose 
                that the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is so good that the answers to the questions 
                are indistinguishable from those of a native Chinese speaker. 
                But all the same, neither the person inside nor any other part 
                of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> literally understands Chinese; and because the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has nothing that this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> does not have, the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, qua <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, does not understand Chinese either. Because 
                the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is purely formal or syntactical and because minds 
                have mental or semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s, any attempt to produce a <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> 
                purely with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s leaves out the essential features 
                of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to recognize that for this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>&#8212;the 
              person and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>&#8212;to, as Professor Searle puts it, &#8220;give 
              a perfect simulation of some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, such as the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to understand Chinese&#8221; and to convincingly answer 
              questions in Chinese, this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is essentially passing a Chinese 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>. It is entirely equivalent to a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>. In the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> answers questions in a <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> 
              such as English, or it could be Chinese, in a way that is convincing 
              to a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judge. That is essentially the premise here in the Chinese 
              Room. Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that we are not talking about answering questions 
              from a fixed list of stock questions (because that&#8217;s a trivial 
              task), but answering any unanticipated question or sequence of questions 
              from a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> interrogator, just as in Turing&#8217;s 
              eponymous test. </p>
<p>Now, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> has little or no significance. 
              He is just feeding things into the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and mechanically transmitting 
              the output of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. And the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> don&#8217;t 
              need to be in a room either.<i> Both the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and the room are 
              irrelevant</i>. The only thing that is significant is the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>Now for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to really perform this &#8220;perfect simulation 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to understand 
              Chinese,&#8221; it would have to, indeed, understand Chinese. It 
              has, according to the very premise &#8220;the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to understand 
              Chinese,&#8221; so it is then entirely contradictory to say that 
              &#8220;the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> . . . does not understand Chinese.&#8221; 
              The premise here directly contradicts itself. </p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <i>as we know them today</i> could 
              not successfully perform the described task. So if we are to understand 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to be like today&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, then it is not fulfilling 
              the premise. The only way that it could fulfill the premise would 
              be for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to have the depth and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              has. That was Turing&#8217;s brilliant insight in proposing the Turing 
              Test, that convincingly answering questions in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> 
              really probes all of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We&#8217;re not talking 
              here about answering a question from a canned <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of questions, 
              but answering any possible sequence of questions from an intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> questioner. A <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that could only answer a fixed <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of 
              questions would quickly be unmasked by a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able interlocutor. 
              That requires a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. </p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that is capable of accomplishing this&#8212;a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              that we will run into a few decades from now&#8212;will need to be 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> or greater, and will indeed understand Chinese 
              in a deep way&#8212;because otherwise it would never be convincing 
              in its claim to understand Chinese.</p>
<p>So just stating the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> &#8220;does not literally understand 
              Chinese&#8221; does not make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. It contradicts the entire premise. 
            </p>
<p>To claim that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not conscious is not compelling either. 
              To be consistent with some of Searle&#8217;s other statements, we 
              have to conclude that we really don&#8217;t know if it is conscious 
              or not. With regard to relatively simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, including today&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, while we can&#8217;t state for certain that these entities 
              are not conscious, their behavior, including their inner workings, 
              don&#8217;t give us that impression. But that will not be true for 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that can really do what is needed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese room</a>. 
              Such a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will at least seem conscious. Whether it is or not, 
              we really cannot make a definitive statement. But just declaring 
              that it is obvious that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (or the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, person and room) is not conscious is far from a compelling 
              argument. </p>
<p>In the quote I read above, Professor Searle is saying that &#8220;the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is purely formal or syntactical.&#8221; But as I pointed 
              out above, that is a bad assumption based on Searle&#8217;s failure 
              to understand the requirements of such a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. This assumption 
              is behind much of the criticism of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> that we have heard from certain 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> critics such as Searle. A <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that is purely formal or syntactical 
              will not be able to understand Chinese, and it won&#8217;t &#8220;give 
              a perfect simulation of some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>But again, we don&#8217;t have to build our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that way. We 
              can build them the same way <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> built the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brain: using 
              chaotic emergent <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s that are massively parallel. Furthermore, 
              there is nothing preventing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s from mastering <a class="thought" href="entries/semantics_entry.html">semantics</a>. There 
              is nothing inherent in the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that restricts its 
              expertise to the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> alone. Indeed if the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> inherent 
              in Searle&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> had not mastered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/semantics_entry.html">semantics</a>, it would not be able to convincingly answer questions 
              in Chinese and thus would contradict Searle&#8217;s own premise. 
            </p>
<p>One approach, as I discuss at length in my book and in my chapter 
              in this book, is to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er and copy the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (with possible extensions). And if it is a Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the copy will understand Chinese. I am not talking about 
              a simulation per se, but rather a duplication of the causal powers 
              of the massive <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> cluster that constitutes the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, at least 
              those causal powers <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> and relevant to <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. </p>
<p>Will such a copy be conscious? I don&#8217;t think the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> 
              Argument tells us anything about this question. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Although it is clearly not his intent, Searle&#8217;s own argument 
              implies that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> has no understanding. He writes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> . . . succeeds by manipulating formal

              of this, it just shuffles the <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Searle acknowledges that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, so if

              and &#8220;neurotransmitter concentrations and related mechanisms&#8221; 
              for &#8220;formal <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s,&#8221; we get:</p>

<p>
<blockquote><i>The [human brain] . . . succeeds by manipulating [neurotransmitter

<p></p>
<p>Of course, <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations and other neural details 
              (e.g., interneuronal connection <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s) have no meaning in and 
              of themselves. The meaning and understanding that emerges in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is exactly that: an emergent property of its complex 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of activity. The same is true for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Although the 
              &#8220;shuffling <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s&#8221; do not have meaning in and of themselves,

<p></p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Two: People Manipulating Slips of Paper</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Okay, now let&#8217;s address a second <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of the Chinese 
              Room. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument, the room 
              does not include a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> but has a room full of people manipulating 
              slips of paper with Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s on it. The idea is that this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of a room, people, and slips of paper would convincingly 
              answer questions in Chinese, but none of the participants would 
              know Chinese, nor could we say that the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> really knows 
              Chinese. Not in a conscious way, anyway. Searle then essentially 
              ridicules the idea that this &#8220;system&#8221; could be conscious. 
              What are we to consider conscious, Searle asks: the slips of paper, 
              the room? Of course the very notion sounds absurd, so the point 
              is made. </p>
<p>One of the problems with this version of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument 
              is that this model of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> does not come remotely close 
              to really solving the specific problem of answering questions in 
              Chinese. This form of <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> is really a description of a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-like process that uses the equivalent of a table look-up, 
              with perhaps some straightforward logical manipulations, to answer 
              questions. It would be able to answer some limited <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of canned 
              questions. But if it were to answer any arbitrary question that 
              it might be asked, this process would really have to understand 
              Chinese in the same way that a Chinese person does. Again, it is 
              essentially being asked to pass a Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>. And as such, 
              it would need to be as clever, and about as complex, as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, a Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. And straightforward table look-up 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s are simply not going to work. </p>
<p>If we want to recreate a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that understands Chinese using people 
              as little cogs in the recreation, we would really need a person 
              for each neural connection, so we would need about a hundred trillion 
              people, which means about ten thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> Earths with ten billion 
              persons each. This would require a rather large room. And even if 
              extremely efficient organized, this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> would run many thousands 
              of times slower than the Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> it is attempting to recreate 
              (by the way, I say thousands, and not millions or trillions because 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is very slow compared to <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s&#8212;200 
              calculations per second versus about one billion for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s today). 
            </p>
<p>So Professor Searle is taking an utterly unrealistic solution, 
              one that does not come close to fulfilling its own premise, and 
              then asks us to perform a mental <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> that considers 
              whether or not this unrealistic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is conscious, or knows anything 
              about Chinese. The very word &#8220;room&#8221; is misleading, as 
              it implies a limited <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people with some manageable <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of slips of papers. So people think of this so-called &#8220;room&#8221; 
              and these slips of papers and the rules of manipulating the slips 
              of paper and then are asked to consider if this &#8220;system&#8221; 
              is conscious. The apparent absurdity of considering this simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to be conscious is therefore supposed to show that such a 
              recreation of an intelligent process would not really &#8220;know&#8221; 
              Chinese. </p>
<p>However, if we were to do it right, so that it would actually work, 
              it would take on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a hundred trillion people. Now it&#8217;s 
              true that none of these hundred trillion people would need to know 
              anything about Chinese, and none of them would necessarily know 
              what is going on in this elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. But that&#8217;s equally 
              true of the neural connections in a real <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. None of the 
              hundred trillion connections in my <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> knows anything about this 
              Discovery Institute book chapter I am writing, nor do any of them 
              know English, nor any of the other things that I know. None of them 
              are conscious of this chapter, nor of any of the things I am conscious 
              of. Probably none of them are conscious at all. But the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              of them, that is <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, is conscious. At least, I&#8217;m 
              claiming that I&#8217;m conscious. </p>
<p>So if we scale up Searle&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> to be the rather massive 
              &#8220;room&#8221; it needs to be, who&#8217;s to say that the entire 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of a hundred trillion people simulating a Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> that 
              knows Chinese isn&#8217;t conscious? Certainly, it would be correct 
              to say that such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> knows Chinese. And we can&#8217;t say that 
              it is not conscious anymore than we can say that about any other 
              process. We can&#8217;t know the <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of another 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> (and in at least some of Searle&#8217;s writings, he appears 
              to acknowledge this limitation). And this massive hundred trillion 
              person &#8220;room&#8221; is an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>. And perhaps it is conscious. 
              Searle is just declaring ipso facto that it isn&#8217;t conscious, 
              and that this conclusion is obvious. It may seem that way when you 
              call it a room, and talk about a limited <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people manipulating 
              a limited <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of pieces of paper. But as I said, such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              doesn&#8217;t remotely work. </p>
<p>A key to the philosophical sleight of hand implicit in the Chinese 
              Room Argument has specifically to do with the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and scale 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Searle says that whereas he cannot prove that his 
              typewriter or tape recorder are not conscious, he feels it is obvious 
              that they are not. Why is this so obvious? At least one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> is 
              because a typewriter and a tape recorder are relatively simple entities. 
            </p>
<p>But the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> or absence of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is not so obvious 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that is as complex as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, indeed one that 
              may be a direct copy of the organization and causal powers of a 
              real <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. If such a &#8220;system&#8221; acts <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and knows 
              Chinese in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> way, is it conscious? Now the answer is no longer 
              so obvious. What Searle is saying in the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument is 
              that we take a simple &#8220;machine&#8221;&#8212;and the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              of a room of people manipulating slips of paper is indeed a simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8212;and then consider how absurd it is to consider such 
              a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to be conscious. </p>
<p>I would agree that a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> appears not to be conscious, 
              and that a room of people manipulating slips of paper does not appear 
              to be conscious. But such a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, whether it be a typewriter, 
              a tape recorder, or a room of people manipulating slips of paper 
              cannot possibly answer questions in Chinese. So the fallacy has 
              everything to do with the scale and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s do not appear to be conscious (again, this is not a proof, 
              but a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able conclusion nonetheless). The possible <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that are as complex as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is an entirely 
              different question. <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">Complexity</a> alone does not necessarily give us 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> tells us nothing about whether 
              or not such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is conscious. The way Searle describes this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> makes it sound like a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, so it seems <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able 
              to conclude that it isn&#8217;t conscious. What he doesn&#8217;t tell 
              you is that the room needs to be much bigger than the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>, 
              so this apparently simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> isn&#8217;t really so simple at 
              all. </p>
<p></p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Three: A Person with a Rule Book</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A third variant of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> is that there is only one person 
              manipulating slips of papers according to a &#8220;rule book.&#8221; 
              Searle then asks what we are we to consider conscious: the slips 
              of paper, the rule book, the room? Again, the humorous absurdity 
              of the situation clearly implies that the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is not conscious, 
              and does not really &#8220;know&#8221; Chinese. </p>
<p>But again, it would be utterly infeasible for this little <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              to provide &#8220;a perfect simulation of some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, 
              such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to understand Chinese&#8221; unless the rule 
              book were to be as complex as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that understands Chinese. 
              And then it would take absurdly long for the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> to follow the 
              trillions of rules. </p>
<p>Okay, how about if the rule book simply listed every possible question, 
              and then provided the answer? This would be even less feasible, 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible questions is in the trillions of trillions. 
            </p>
<p>Also keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that the answer to a question would need to consider 
              all of the dialogue that came before it. </p>
<p>The term &#8220;rule book&#8221; implies a book of hundreds or maybe 
              thousands of pages of rules, but not many trillions of pages.</p>
<p>So again we have a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8212;a person and a &#8220;rule 
              book&#8221;&#8212;and the apparent absurdity of such a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              &#8220;knowing&#8221; Chinese or being conscious. But what really 
              is absurd is the notion that such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, even in theory, could 
              really answer questions in Chinese in a convincing way. </p>
<p>The version of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Searle cites in his chapter in 
              this book is closest to this third <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion. One just replaces 
              &#8220;rule book&#8221; with &#8220;computer <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.&#8221; But as 
              I point out above, the man in the room is acting like the central 
              processing unit (<a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a>) of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> carrying out the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. 
              One could indeed say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, being only a small 
              part of a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, does not understand what the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              understands. One has to look for understanding from the right perspective. 
              The understanding, in this case, is distributed across the entire 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, including a vastly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, and the billions of 
              little notes that the man would have to keep and organize in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              to actually follow the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. That&#8217;s where the understanding 
              lies, not in the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a> (i.e., the man in the room) alone. It is a 
              distributed understanding embedded in a vast <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>, a type of 
              understanding that Searle appears not to recognize. </p>

<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>: With Decorations from the Ming 
              Dynasty</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Okay, so here is my <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>. Call it Ray 
              Kurzweil&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>:</p>
<p>There is a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> in a room. The room has decorations from the Ming 
              Dynasty. There is a pedestal on which sits a mechanical typewriter. 
              The typewriter has been modified so that there are Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s 
              on the keys instead of English letters. And the mechanical linkages 
              have been cleverly altered so that when the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> types in a question 
              in Chinese, the typewriter does not type the question, but instead 
              types the answer to the question.</p>
<p>Now the person receives questions in Chinese characters, and dutifully 
              presses the appropriate keys on the typewriter. The typewriter types 
              out not the question, but the appropriate answer. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> then 
              passes the answer outside the room.</p>
<p>So here we have a room with a man in it that appears to know Chinese, 
              yet clearly the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> does not know Chinese. And clearly the typewriter 
              does not know Chinese either. It is just an ordinary typewriter 
              with its mechanical linkages modified. So despite the fact that 
              the man in the room can answer questions in Chinese, who or what 
              can we say truly knows Chinese? The decorations?</p>
<p>Now you might have some <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ions to my <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>. </p>
<p><i>You might point out that the decorations don&#8217;t seem to 
              have any significance.</i></p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s true. Neither does the pedestal. The same can 
              be said for the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, and for the room.</p>
<p>You might also point out that the premise is absurd. <i>Just changing 
              the mechanical linkages in a mechanical typewriter could not possibly 
              enable it to convincingly answer questions in Chinese</i> (not to 
              mention the fact that we can&#8217;t fit all the Kanji <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s on 
              the keys).</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a valid <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion as well. Now the only difference 
              between my <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion, and the several proposed by 
              Professor Searle, is that it is <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>ly obvious in my <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              that it couldn&#8217;t possibly work. It is obvious that my <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              is absurd. That is not quite as apparent to many readers or listeners 
              with regard to the Searle <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a>s. However, it is equally 
              the case. </p>
<p>Now, wait a second. We can make my <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion work, just as we 
              can make Searle&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ions work. All you have to do is to 
              make the typewriter linkages as complex as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. And that&#8217;s 
              theoretically (if not practically) possible. But the phrase &#8220;typewriter 
              linkages&#8221; does not suggest such vast <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. The same is 
              true when Searle talks about a person manipulating slips of paper 
              or following a book of rules or a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. These are all 
              equally misleading <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ions.</p>

<p>Searle&#8217;s application of his <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> is equally 
              misleading. He says the man in the room &#8220;looks up in a book 
              what he is supposed to do.&#8221; So again, we have a simple look-up 
              procedure. What sort of book is Searle imagining? If it lists all 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> situations that the man might confront, there wouldn&#8217;t

              I checked, is not regulation <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>. </p>
<p>Searle&#8217;s primary point is contained in his statement:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The man understands nothing of chess; he is just a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              And the point of the parable is this: if the man does not understand 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> on the basis of running the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, neither 
              does any other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> solely on that basis. </blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As I pointed out earlier, Searle is simply assuming his conclusion: 
              the man &#8220;is just a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>,&#8221; so obviously (to Searle) 
              he cannot understand anything. But the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> which includes 
              the rule book and the man following the rule book does &#8220;understand&#8221; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, or else it wouldn&#8217;t be able to play the game. </p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that playing good <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, even championship 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, is a lot easier than convincingly answering questions in 
              a natural <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> such as Chinese. But then, Searle shifts 
              the task from playing <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> to being <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able about <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>: knowing something about the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and role of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, having <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the roles of kings and queens who 
              do not necessarily stand on <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> squares, having <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s to want 
              to win the game, being able to articulate such <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, and so on. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able test of such <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> 
              would be answering questions about <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> and engaging in a convincing 
              dialogue (in the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>) about <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> using a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> 
              such as English or Chinese. And now we have a task that is very 
              similar to the original <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> task, to which my comments 
              above pertain. </p>

<h2>On the Difference Between Simulation and Re-Creation</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This discussion of Searle&#8217;s, which he <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s (1), is so hopelessly 
              confused that it is difficult to know where to begin to unravel 
              his tautological and contradictory <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing.</p>
<p>Let me start with Searle&#8217;s stomach <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>. He writes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>What the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> does is a simulation of these processes, 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic model of the processes. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes that produce <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> stands to real <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of the stomach processes that produce 
              digestion stands to real digestion. You do not cause digestion by 
              doing a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of digestion. Nobody thinks that if 
              we had the perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation running on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              we could stuff a pizza into the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and it would thereby digest 
              it. It is the same mistake to suppose that when a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulates 
              the processes of a conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> it is thereby conscious.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>As I point out in at the beginning of my discussion of Searle&#8217;s 
              chapter above, Searle confuses simulation with functionally equivalent 
              recreation. We could indeed stuff a pizza into an artificial stomach. 
              It may have a very different design than an ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> stomach, 
              but if properly designed, it would digest the pizza as well, or 
              perhaps even better than, a real stomach (in the case of some people&#8217;s 
              stomachs, that probably wouldn&#8217;t be so hard to do). </p>
<p>In my chapter and in my book, I discuss the creation of functionally 
              equivalent recreations of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (which has been done), 
              of substantial clusters of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (which has also been done), and, 
              ultimately, of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. I am not talking about conventional 
              neural nets, which involve mathematically simplified <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, but 
              recreations of the full <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> behavior 
              and response of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and other <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters. 
              And these clusters have been growing rapidly (in accordance with 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>). A few years ago, we could only 
              replicate <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, then we could replicate clusters of 
              tens of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, then hundreds, and scientists are now replicating 
              clusters of thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Scaling up to the billions of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> may seem daunting, but so did the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> scan when first proposed. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t assume that a perfect or near-perfect recreation of 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> would necessarily be conscious. But we can expect 
              that it would exhibit the same subtle, complex behavior and abilities 
              that we associate with humans. Our wonderful ability to connect 
              chessboard kings to historical kings and to reflect on the meaning 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, and all of our other endearing abilities to put ideas 
              in a panoply of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>s is the result of the complex swirl of millions 
              of interacting processes that take place in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. If 
              we recreate (and ultimately, vastly extend) these processes, we 
              will get comparably rich and subtle behavior. Such entities will 
              at least convincingly seem conscious. But I am the first to agree 
              that this does not prove that they are in fact conscious. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Here again, Searle assumes that the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s used by <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> are 
              the only way to build intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Searle may assume this, 
              but that is clearly not what my book discusses. There are other 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s that do not involve the manipulation of formal <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s in 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. We have discovered that the behavior and functioning 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, while quite complex, are describable in mathematical 
              terms. This should not be surprising, as <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are constructed 
              of real materials following natural laws. And chips have been created 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> these descriptions, and the chips operate in a very 
              similar manner to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. We are even putting such chips 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains to replace disabled portions of those brains, as 
              in the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s for deafness, Parkinson&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a>, 
              and a growing list of other conditions. </p>
<p>There is nothing in Searle&#8217;s arguments that argues against 
              our ability to scale up these efforts to capture all of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              and then extend it in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> mediums. As I pointed out above, 
              these efforts are already scaling up very quickly. </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is remarkable that Searle describes the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing Thesis</a> 
              as a &#8220;mathematical result,&#8221; but more about that later. 
              Searle here is confusing different results of Church and Turing. 
              Turing and Church independently derived mathematical theorems that 
              show that <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s such as a neural net can be carried out, albeit 
              very slowly, on a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>, which can be considered as a universal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>-manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. They also put forth a conjecture, which 
              has become known as the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing Thesis</a>, which is not mathematical 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, but rather relates certain abilities of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              (in particular its mathematical abilities) to abilities of a Turing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>. </p>
<p>We know in practical terms that we can precisely replicate neural 
              functioning in <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. No one has demonstrated any practical 
              limits to our ability to do this. In the book, I discuss our efforts 
              to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and the many different schools of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> pursuing the replication of its abilities. </p>
<p>Searle acknowledges that neural nets can be emulated through <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. 
              Well, that only confirms my thesis. Although many contemporary neural 
              nets involve highly simplified models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, a neural net does 
              not necessarily need to be based on such simplified models of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. They can be built from models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s that are just 
              as complex as <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, or even more complex. And doing 
              so would not change the implications of Turing&#8217;s and Church&#8217;s 
              theorems. So we could still replicate these neural nets through 
              forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. And indeed we have been successfully doing 
              exactly this, and such efforts are rapidly increasing in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. 
            </p>
<p>As for simulation not being duplication, as I pointed out above, 
              I am specifically talking about functionally equivalent duplication.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As I discussed earlier, Searle frequently changes my statements 
              in critical ways, and in this case has left out the word &#8220;convincingly.&#8221; 
              Of course one can trivially make a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> claim to be conscious. 
              I make the same point repeatedly. Claims to be conscious neither 
              prove nor even suggest its actual presence, nor does an inability 
              to make such a claim demonstrate a lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. What I 
              am asserting, specifically, is that we will meet entities in several 
              decades that convincingly claim to be conscious. </p>
<p>Searle asserts that I assert that people will &#8220;just come to 
              accept without question that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are conscious.&#8221; This 
              is a typical distortion of Searle. Many people will accept that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are conscious precisely because the claims will be convincing. 
              There is a huge difference between idle claims (which are feasible 
              today), and convincing claims (which are not yet feasible). It is 
              the difference between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, 
              and one of the primary points of my book. </p>
<p>Now what does it mean to be convincing? It means that when a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> talks about its feelings, its behavior at that moment and 
              subsequently will be fully consistent with what we would expect 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> who professed such feelings. This requires enormously 
              subtle, deep, and complex behavior. <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">Nonbiological</a> entities today 
              do not have this ability. What I am specifically claiming is that 
              twenty-first century <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities will. </p>
<p>This development will have enormous implications for the relationship 
              between humans and the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> we will have created, and I talk 
              extensively in the book about these implications.</p>
<p>One of those implications is not that such entities are necessarily 
              conscious, even though their claims (to be conscious) will be convincing. 
              We come back to the inability to penetrate the <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> 
              of another <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>. We accept that other humans are conscious, but 
              even this is a shared assumption. And humans are not of like <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> 
              when it comes to the <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> entities such as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. We can argue about the issue, but there is no definitive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>-detector that we can use to settle the argument. The 
              issue of the potential <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities will 
              be even more <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious than the arguments we have today about 
              the potential <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> entities. My prediction 
              is more a political prediction than a philosophical one. </p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Searle writes: &#8220;Actual <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains 
              cause <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> by a series of specific neurobiological processes 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>Searle provides (and has provided) no basis for such a startling 
              view. To illuminate where Searle is coming from, I take the liberty 
              of quoting from a letter Searle sent me (dated December 15, 1998), 
              in which he writes </p>
<p>
<blockquote>. . . it may turn out that rather simple <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s like 
              termites or snails are conscious. . .The essential thing is to recognize 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> process like digestion, lactation, 
              photosynthesis, or <a class="thought" href="entries/mitosis_entry.html">mitosis</a>, and you should look for its specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> as you look for the specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> of these other processes.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>I wrote Searle back: </p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Yes, it is true that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> emerges from the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              process(es) of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body, but there is at least one difference. 
              If I ask the question, &#8220;does a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> emit <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> 
              dioxide,&#8221; I can answer that question through clear <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive 
              measurement. If I ask the question, &#8220;is this <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> conscious,&#8221; 
              I may be able to provide inferential arguments&#8212;possibly strong 
              and convincing ones&#8212;but not clear <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive measurement.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>With regard to the snail, I wrote: </p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when you say that a snail may be conscious, I think what 
                you are saying is the following: that we may discover a certain 
                neurophysiological basis for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> (call it &#8220;x&#8221;) 
                in humans such that when this basis was present humans were conscious, 
                and when it was not present humans were not conscious. So we would 
                presumably have an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ively measurable basis for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. 
                And then if we found that in a snail, we could conclude that it 
                was conscious. But this inferential conclusion is just a strong 
                suggestion, it is not a proof of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> on the 
                snail&#8217;s part. It may be that humans are conscious because 
                they have &#8220;x&#8221; as well as some other quality that essentially 
                all humans share, call this &#8220;y.&#8221; The &#8220;y&#8221; may 
                have to do with a human&#8217;s level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> or something 
                having to do with the way we are organized, or with the quantum 
                properties of our tubules (although this may be part of &#8220;x&#8221;), 
                or something else entirely. The snail has &#8220;x&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t 
                have &#8220;y&#8221; and so it may not be conscious. </p>
<p></p>
<p>How would one settle such an argument? You obviously can&#8217;t 
                ask the snail. You can&#8217;t tell from its fairly simple and 
                more-or-less predictable behavior. Pointing out that it has &#8220;x&#8221; 
                may be a good argument and many people may be convinced by it. 
                But it&#8217;s just an argument, it&#8217;s not a direct measurement 
                of the snail&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>. Once again, <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive 
                measurement is incompatible with the very <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of subjective 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And indeed we have such arguments today. Not about snails so 
                much, but about higher level <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. It is apparent to me that 
                dogs and cats are conscious, and I think you mentioned that you 
                accept this as well. But not all humans accept this. I can imagine 
                scientific ways of strengthening the argument by pointing out 
                many similarities between these <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s and humans, but again 
                these are just arguments, not scientific proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Searle expects to find some clear <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> &#8220;cause&#8221; 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. And he seems unable to acknowledge that either 
              understanding or <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> may emerge from an overall <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              of activity. Other philosophers, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/dennett_entry.html">Daniel Dennet</a>t, have articulated 
              such &#8220;pattern emergent&#8221; theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. But 
              whether &#8220;caused&#8221; by a specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> process or by 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of activity, Searle provides no foundation for how we 
              would measure or detect <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Finding a neurological correlate 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> in humans does not prove that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is 
              necessarily present in other entities with the same correlate, nor 
              does it prove that the absence of such correlate indicates the absence 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Such inferential arguments necessarily stop short 
              of direct measurement. In this way, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> differs from <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ively 
              measurable processes such as lactation and photosynthesis. </p>
<p>Searle writes in his chapter: &#8220;It is out of the question, 
              for purely neurobiological <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, to suppose that the chair or 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is conscious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just what neurobiological <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s is Searle talking about? I agree 
              that chairs don&#8217;t seem to be conscious, but as for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> that have the same <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, depth, subtlety, and 
              capabilities as humans, I don&#8217;t think we can rule out the possibility 
              that they are conscious. Searle just assumes that they are not, 
              and that it is &#8220;out of the question&#8221; to suppose otherwise. 
              There is really nothing more of a substantive <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> to Searle&#8217;s 
              &#8220;arguments&#8221; than this tautology. </p>
<p>Now part of the appeal of Searle&#8217;s stance against the possibility 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> being conscious is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s we know today 
              just don&#8217;t seem to be conscious. Their behavior is brittle 
              and formulaic, even if they are occasionally unpredictable. But 
              as I pointed out above, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s today are still a million times 
              simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which is at least one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> they 
              don&#8217;t share all of the endearing qualities of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. 
              But that disparity is rapidly shrinking, and will ultimately reverse 
              itself in several decades. The twenty-first century <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s I am 
              talking about in the book will appear and act very differently than 
              the relatively simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s of today. </p>
<p>Searle may assert that the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> is 
              irrelevant, that even if <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities become trillions 
              of times more complex and capable than humans, they inherently just 
              don&#8217;t have this mysterious neurobiological basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. 
              I have no problem with his believing that, but he should present 
              it simply as his belief, and not wrap it in tautological arguments 
              that provide no basis for such a belief.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> Argument is based on the idea that it seems ridiculous 
              that a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can be conscious. He then describes a simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> successfully carrying out deep, extremely complex tasks 
              such as answering unanticipated questions in Chinese. But simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s would never accomplish such tasks. However, with regard 
              to the extremely complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that could accomplish such difficult 
              and subtle tasks, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that would necessarily match or exceed 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a> tells us nothing 
              about their <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. It may be that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> emerges 
              from certain types of very complex self-organizing processes that 
              take place in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. If so, then recreating the essence 
              of these processes would also result in <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. It is certainly 
              a plausible conjecture. </p>
<p>Searle writes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Kurzweil is aware of this <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion and tries to meet 
              it with a slippery-slope argument: We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> implants,

              us from a gradual replacement of all the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> anatomy that would 
              preserve and not merely simulate our <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and the rest 
              of our mental life? In answer to this, I would point out that he

<p></p>
<p>Once again, Searle misrepresents the essence of my argument. As 
              I described in my chapter in this book and in greater detail in 
              my book, I describe this slippery-slope scenario and then provide 
              two strong arguments: one that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is preserved, and a 
              second argument that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is not preserved. I present this 
              specifically to illustrate the contradictions inherent in simplistic 
              explanations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. The difficulty 
              of resolving this undeniably <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issue, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>es 
              inherent in our understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, stem, once again, 
              from our inability to penetrate <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive 
              measurement. I frequently present the perplexity of the issue of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> by showing how <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able and logical arguments lead 
              us to contradictory conclusions. Searle takes one of these arguments 
              completely out of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> and then presents that as my position. 
            </p>
<p>As for &#8220;abandoning the main thesis of [my] book, Searle&#8217;s 
              assertion is absurd. The primary thesis of the book is exactly this: 
              that we will recreate the processes in our brains, and then extend 
              them, and ultimately <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> these enhanced processes into our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. I maintain that these recreated <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s

<h2>On the Difference Between Intrinsic (Observer Independent) and 
              Observer-Relative Features of the World</h2>
<p></p>
<p>With regard to Searle&#8217;s argument that he <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s (2), I will 
              respond briefly as many of the points have already been covered. 
              First of all, I will point out that from a prevalent interpretation 
              of quantum theory, all features of the world are rendered as observer-relative. 
              But let&#8217;s consider Searle&#8217;s distinction as valid for the 
              world as it appears to us. </p>
<p>Searle writes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In a psychological, observer-independent <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, I am more

<p></p>
<p>Searle doesn&#8217;t define what he means by mental <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. But by 
              any <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able interpretation of the term, I would grant that Searle&#8217;s 
              observation is <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able with respect to pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, cars,

              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. But as for the &#8220;computers&#8221; that we will meet 
              a few decades from now, Searle&#8217;s statement just reveals, once 
              again, his bias that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are inherently incapable of &#8220;mental 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.&#8221; It is an assumption that produces an identical conclusion,

                that we cannot solve, or cannot solve as efficiently, in an unaided

                than I at arithmetic? Well, in an intrinsic or observer-independent 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, of course not, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has no <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> whatever, 
                it is just an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> that we have designed, and can 
                ourselves operate, for certain purposes. But in the metaphorical 
                or observer-relative <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, it is perfectly legitimate to say 
                that the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has more <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, because 
                it can produce better results. And the same can be said for the 
                pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with using the word &#8220;intelligence&#8221; 
                in both senses, provided you understand the difference between 
                the observer-relative and the observer-independent. The difficulty 
                is that this word has been used as if it were a scientific term, 
                with a scientifically precise meaning. Indeed, many of the exaggerated 
                claims made on behalf of &#8220;artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8221; have 
                been based on this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic confusion between observer-independent, 
                psychologically relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and metaphorical, observer-relative, 
                psychologically irrelevant ascriptions of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. There 
                is nothing wrong with the metaphor as such; the only mistake is 
                to think that it is a scientifically precise and unambiguous term. 
                A better term than &#8220;artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8221; would have 
                been &#8220;simulated cognition.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Exactly the same confusion comes over the notion of &#8220;computation.&#8221; 
                There is a literal <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s because, 
                for example, we can compute 2+2=4. But when we design a piece 
                of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to carry out that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 2+2=4 
                exists only relative to our assignment of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al interpretation 
                to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Intrinsically, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is just an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> with very rapid changes between such things as voltage 
                levels. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> knows nothing about arithmetic just as it 
                knows nothing about <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>. And it knows nothing about <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
                either, because it knows nothing at all. We use the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry 
                to compute with, but that does not mean that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is 
                intrinsic to the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is 
                observer-relative, or to put it more traditionally, &#8220;in the 
                eye of the beholder.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This distinction is fatal to Kurzweil&#8217;s entire argument, 
                because it rests on the assumption that the main thing humans 
                do in their lives is compute. Hence, on his view, if&#8212;thanks 
                to Moore&#8217;s Law&#8212;we can create <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can compute 
                better than humans, we have equaled and surpassed humans in all 
                that is distinctively <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. But in fact humans do rather little 
                that is literally computing. Very little of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is spent 
                working out <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s to figure out answers to questions. Some 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes can be usefully described as if they were <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al, 
                but that is observer-relative. That is like the attribution of 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, in that it requires an outside 
                observer or interpreter.</p>

<p>There are many confusions in the lengthy quote above, several of 
              which I have already discussed. When I speak of the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              that will emerge in twenty-first century <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s as a result of

              am not referring to the &#8220;narrow&#8221; victories of contemporary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in areas such as <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, diagnosing blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> images, 
              or tracking land terrain images in a cruise missile. What I am talking 
              about is recreating the processes that take place in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              which, as Searle acknowledges, is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that follows natural 
              laws in the physical world. It is disingenuous for Searle to maintain 
              that I confuse the narrow calculations of a <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> or even a 
              game-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> with the sorts of deep <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> displayed 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>I do not maintain that the processes that take place in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains 
              can be recreated in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s because <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings 
              are capable of performing arithmetic. This is typical of Searle&#8217;s 
              disingenuous arguments: attributing absurd assertions to my book 
              that in fact it never makes, and then pointing to their absurdity. 
            </p>
<p>Another example is his false statement that I assume that the main 
              thing humans do in their lives is compute. I make the opposite point: 
              very little of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is spent &#8220;computing.&#8221; I make it 
              clear that what goes on in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>: the complex, chaotic, and unpredictable interplay of millions

              means of performing mental <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> (in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that Searle 
              refers to in the above quote) at all. When we perform &#8220;computations&#8221; 
              such as figuring out 2+2, we use very indirect and complex means. 
              There is no direct <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> in our brains. </p>

              sharing ability that constitute a current superiority of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              As I mentioned above, humans are unable to directly transfer their

<p>It is remarkable that Searle refers to the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing Thesis</a> 
              as a &#8220;mathematical result.&#8221; He must be confusing the Church-Turing 
              Thesis (CTT) with Church and Turing theorems. CTT is not a mathematical 
              theorem at all, but rather a philosophical conjecture which relates 
              to a proposed relationship between what a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> can do and 
              what a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a> can do. There are a range of versions or interpretations 
              of CTT. A standard version is that any <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> can use 
              to solve a mathematical problem in a finite amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> can be 
              expressed as a general recursive function and can therefore be solved 
              in a finite amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>. Searle&#8217;s definition 
              only makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> if we interpret his phrase &#8220;algorithmic solution&#8221; 
              to mean a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> follows, but that is not the common 
              meaning of this phrase (unless we qualify the phrase as in &#8220;algorithmic 
              solutions <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed by a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brain&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;algorithmic 
              solution&#8221; usually refers to a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that can be <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed 
              on a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>. This makes the Searle definition a tautology. 
            </p>
<p>Broader versions of CTT consider problems beyond mathematical problems, 
              which is consistent with the definition I offer in the book&#8217;s 
              timeline. The definition I provided is necessarily simplified as 
              it is one brief entry in a lengthy timeline (&#8220;1937: Alonzo 
              Church and <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> independently develop the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing Thesis</a>. 
              This thesis states that all problems that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being can solve 
              can be reduced to a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, supporting the idea that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are essentially equivalent&#8221;). 
              In this <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of CTT, I relate problems solvable by a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, and use the word &#8220;algorithms&#8221; in its normal

              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>. </p>
<p>There are yet broader <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ions of CTT that relate the processes 
              that take place in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s that are computable. 
              This conjecture is based on the following: (i) the constituent <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              of brains (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, interneuronal connections, synaptic clefts, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations) are made up of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, 
              therefore: (ii) these constituent <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s follow physical laws, 
              therefore: (iii) the behavior of these <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s are describable

<p>I believe that the scale of Searle&#8217;s misrepresentation of

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I am writing in the hopes that someone would give me a straight answer to a straight question: 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it possible or not that we will soon have adequate CAT spoken translation between natural languages?  
<br>
<br>
K says that this will be normal between major language pairs by 2009 (haven't the book in front of me at the moment, so correct me if I'm wrong, please).  
<br>
<br>
My reason for asking is this: I am an Applied Linguist much involved in the training of teachers of foreign languages (esp. English) and in the training of translators and interpreters. 
<br>
<br>
If wire-less interpreting via computers will be commonplace in a few years (I speak English and you hear me in a different language), there seems no future for the learning of foreign languages nor for translating texts or interpreting speech. 
<br>
<br>
If this is going to be the case, what do I say to my colleague and their students? 
<br>
<br>
I live and work in Malaysia where, since even before Independence nearly 50 years ago, there has been endless debate and shifts in educational policy over the relationship between the national language (Malay) and English (the ex-colonial language)resulting in a generation whose Malay is excellent but whose English is weak. The latest change in policy is to start teaching science and mathematics in English but retain Malay as medium of instruction at all levels for all other subjects.
<br>
<br>
Am I to try to motivate learners of English by telling them that there will always be a need for bilinguals (i.e. K is wrong)or sit down urgently with my colleagues and the educational planners and face the fact that the bilingual is about to become an anachronism (i.e. K is right)?

<br>
<br>
Anyways, even after the actual technology is developed there will still be demand for linguists for quite some time.  
<br>
For 1 -- People like talking to people more than they do machines. (At least that is the case now and at least until the majority of my generation dies.  And I'm only in my 20's).
<br>
For 2 -- every program has bugs (not excluding human thought) somebodys gotta know enough to find them. Hey, thats you!!

So dont fret too much too soon. ;)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Huge sighs of relief. I won't give up my day job and I'll tell my colleagues not to either but:
<br>
<br>
1. What do we tell the students? If I was a teenager studying a foreign language and told (by some people, though not all) that within 10 (20...50..) years it would all be pointless....?
<br>
<br>
2. As I understand K, one wouldn't talk to a machine. Isn't the idea that you have a tiny computer buried in your clothes or wherever and just talk? The other person who would be standing/sitting(whatever) right in front of you would have no impression that you weren't just talking in his/her own language. No visible machines at all. Of course the lip movements etc would be out but we're used to dubbed films where that happens all the time and it doesn't bother us much.  
<br>
<br>
3. The excursus on Joyce was fun but not what I was personally after nor would the translation of such WRITTEN texts be of much interest to the Malaysian teenager. My focus is on good old bread and butter, day to day conversational exchanges: Searle's speech acts of asserting, agreeing, promising, warning etc. 
<br>
<br>
Can I steer the discussion towards face-to-face interaction. That's where the challenge is, I think. Syntax is pretty easy, semantics (context free, literal, semantic sense) is tougher and pragmatics (context sensitive communicative value) is toughest of all because it demands a thorough understanding of the cultural implications of what is going on i.e. producing utterances which are not only grammatical but acceptable/appropriate.
<br>
<br>
Grammaticality relates to what is possible according to the rules of the code (what CAN be said); acceptability concerns what is appropriate in a particular set of circumstances and that means taking into account who is involved, what their relative statuses is (are!), when, where, why the interaction is taking place and so forth. 
<br>
<br>
'Hi Liz. How's the old man and the kids' is OK as a greeting to my daughter-in-law, who is called Elizabeth, and referring to my son and grandsons but addressed to Her Britannic Majesty Queen Elisabeth II, by the Grace of God.... it would play havoc with my chances of getting a Knighthood, wouldn't it? 
<br>
<br>
Children acquire language through their senses and their perception of the whole communicative environment: the order goes (crudely speaking), pragmatics, semantics, syntax. 
<br>
<br>
The computers (and long-suffering students of linguistics) go the other way and come to the context (the 'real world') last. 'There's (just to chuck in a literary quote)'the rub'.

This is the result of your procedure, applied to your text, with the altavista's translator.

<br>
<br>
If you wish to see how they must go far to put to him of business, she takes the best program from the translation that you can find and feed a page to him on Ulyses de James Joyce. Then d&#221;galo to translate that within English again. When a machine can handle that task with any fidelity, it is hour to find a a new job. I calculate to him I am good by perhaps 50 to 100 years.

"Ulysses" in Chinese 
<br>
<br>
The story of an elderly pair of translators and their unusual bestseller
<br>
<br>
by Cait Murphy
<br>
<br>
<br>
 XIAO Qian, a Chinese war correspondent and a literature student, stood over the grave of James Joyce in 1946 in Zurich and mourned, "Here lies the corpse of someone who wasted his great talents writing something very unreadable." Forty-nine years later Xiao still thinks that Joyce carried his virtuosity too far. He has earned the right to his reservations: he and his wife, Wen Jieruo, have just finished a labor that might have humbled Hercules--translating Ulysses into Chinese. "In old age one should do something monumental," says Xiao, who is eighty-five. "This translation is quite monumental." As the name implies ("Ulysses" is a Romanization of "Odysseus"), Ulysses is organized around the Greek myth known as the Odyssey. Homer's saga tells the story of Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, who sails with his army to sack the city of Troy. Odysseus has some difficulty getting back home. Only after ten years, and a goodly number of Boy's Own adventures, is he restored to his faithful wife, Penelope, and his stalwart son, Telemachus.
<br>
<br>
Joyce masticates Homer's Odyssey and spits it out in his saga of a day (June 16, 1904) in the life of two Dubliners, Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) and Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus). Penelope is represented by Bloom's not-so-faithful wife, Molly. Ulysses does not slavishly follow the Odyssey, though each episode in the ancient tale has a counterpart in the modern one. For example, in one Homeric episode Odysseus descends to Hades, the world of the dead; in Joyce's version Leopold Bloom--a Jew and therefore, like Odysseus, an outsider--goes to a funeral. If Homer marks the beginning of Western literature, Joyce suggested, Ulysses was its culmination. "The task I set myself technically in writing a book from eighteen different points of view and in as many styles," he wrote to his benefactress, Harriet Shaw Weaver, "all apparently unknown or undiscovered by my fellow tradesmen, that and the nature of the legend chosen would be enough to upset anyone's mental balance."
<br>
<br>
Xiao and Wen don't need to read Joyce's paean to his own genius to appreciate the mental upsets that Ulysses can produce. "There are places," Xiao says, "where I think he made it unnecessarily difficult." His fellow translators can only agree. Ulysses has been translated into more than twenty languages, including Icelandic, Arabic, Malayalam, and, fittingly, Irish. Perhaps the surprising thing is not that it has now been translated into Chinese but that the translation is only now available. 
<br>
<br>
Much of the delay can be attributed to the antipathy of the Chinese Communists toward bourgeois liberal Western culture. Joyce's work became caught in the Chinese government's straitened view of literature's role--that it should extol the morally upright deeds of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Ulysses--bawdy, irreverent, and anti-heroic--hardly suits. Nor did the Maoist cultural commissars appreciate the literary merits of Ulysses, considering it too pessimistic, subjective, and personal. And perhaps worst of all, it was not concerned nearly enough with the great theme of class struggle. Even with the end, in 1976, of the Cultural Revolution, in which China tried to purge all foreign influences (except Marxism) from the land, Xiao and Wen were confined to translating only what was deemed to be safe material, such as the work of Henry Fielding, Charles Lamb, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
<br>
<br>
So when the two were just about ready to publish their translation, Xiao took the precaution of writing a series of articles for the Chinese press describing the American trial in 1933 that established that Ulysses was not a dirty book. China would look backward, he argued, if it were to ban or censor the book six decades later. Xiao also pointed out the book's "progressive" stance: it was anti-anti-Semitic and anti-imperialistic. 
<br>
<br>
The strategy worked. Published last year, with no interference, the first edition of the three-volume translation sold out its 85,000 copies; a second and a third edition were rushed into print. "We publishers had to be brave to take this kind of risk," says Li Jingduan, the editor of Yilin Publishing House, in Nanjing. "I never imagined this book would be so welcomed by the Chinese reader." Considering the price--about $15, or roughly a week's wages for a high school teacher in China--the sales are phenomenal, and the couple have become modest celebrities. They keep clippings about their work in two thick albums in their book-cluttered four-room apartment near Tiananmen Square, and clearly enjoy the fuss. Wen positively purrs as she recalls a book-signing in Shanghai that attracted a thousand readers. "Five police officers had to come to keep order," she says. "Very excellent." The story made the front pages of Shanghai's newspapers.
<br>
<br>
Xiao and Wen both have traumatic personal memories of times when China was not nearly so accommodating, and see their translation as a major advance for China's cultural life. "I feel that this translation of Ulysses signifies that China at last has opened herself not only in technology and science but also in literature," Xiao says.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Translating Joyce is no party game in any language, of course. Even a simple sentence like "And going forth, he met Butterly" presents dangers. In fact in the book Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus meet no one named Butterly. Mulligan, Stephen's roommate, is just tossing off a clever remark as he and Stephen leave their residence south of Dublin. He is referring, crudely, as is his wont, to the biblical description of Peter after his betrayal of Jesus: "and going forth, he wept bitterly." In English the allusion is obvious enough. In German, though, after much cogitation, the thought has been put this way: they went forth "und weinte Buttermilch"--or "and wept buttermilk." In Chinese it is translated for sound: they "went out and met Ba Teli," meaning "to hope earnestly-special-inside," but in context signaling a group of foreign sounds. Well, okay: the reader is clued in that the phrase is more than it seems. But a lot is lost in translation.
<br>
<br>
Another example: Stephen recalls that he has borrowed a pound from the poet and writer George Russell, who styles himself "A.E." Thinking of his debt, Stephen puns "A.E.I.O.U." In the German, Italian, Czech, and Latvian translations, the expression is simply left as it is, which must be rather baffling to readers. Most others include a native-language gloss. In the 1929 French translation the passage reads "A.E. Je vous dois. I.O.U." In Spanish it is "A.E. Te debo. I.O.U." In Hungarian the vowels are changed, killing the joke: "A.E.K.P." The same is true in Croatian, where an explanation is also added: "A.E.J.V.D (Ja vam dugujem)." "You can only do your best," says Fritz Senn, of the Z&#344;rich James Joyce Foundation. Senn is an authority on Joyce translation. "But of course, if a joke is explained, it is no longer funny." Right. Is there any way to translate Stephen's witticism about Shakespeare's wife: "If others have their will, Ann hath a way"?
<br>
<br>
Many languages at least share the Roman alphabet, and therefore, to varying degrees, a common corpus of sounds. The name Leopold Bloom looks and sounds much the same from Dublin to Detroit, from Harare to Hanoi.
<br>
<br>
Enter China and the rules change. To begin with, there are only 404 possible phonetic combinations in Mandarin, far fewer than in English. Wordplay is inevitably distorted. And Chinese is ideographic, not alphabetic; "home," for example, is represented by a stylized picture that has traditionally been interpreted to be a pig beneath a roof. Ulysses is not pictorial but aural, and comes alive most vividly when read aloud.
<br>
<br>
To make things more difficult, Chinese is a tonal language. In Mandarin, the official national tongue, there are four possible tones to each sound: high level, rising, falling rising, and falling. The tones make a difference. For a crude example of the sounds, consider using the word "Ma" in these different contexts: "Oh, Ma!" in surprised anger at seeing your mother where she shouldn't be, "Oh, Ma!" in exasperation, "Ma" in sober conversation, and "Oh, it's Maaa" in warning at an unexpected phone call from the matriarch. In Chinese, tones change the meaning of a word, not just the emphasis. The four tones for "ma" mean, respectively, "mother," "hemp," "horse," and "to curse." (A fifth tone for "ma," which is actually atonal, turns a sentence into a question.)
<br>
<br>
Proper names are not always translated syllable for syllable. If "America" were to be written sound for sound--that is, one Chinese character for each syllable--it could be construed as "inferior beautiful beneficial addition." That's not a bad metaphor for Chinese ambivalence toward our country, but the standard term for America is actually mei guo, which sounds like "America" said with a mouthful of marbles. At least the name translates well: "Beautiful Country." Sometimes names are assigned with reference not to sound at all but to the way China understands the world. This magazine, for example, named after a great body of water, is translated as "The Great Western Ocean Monthly."
<br>
<br>
And finally, normal Chinese discourse is sometimes best translated loosely. When Americans see each other on the street, they ask, "How are you?" But when two Chinese acquaintances meet, they greet each other this way: "Chi le ma?"--literally, "Have you eaten yet?" That does not call for a recitation of the day's diet any more than "How are you?" is an invitation to describe one's fitness program. Therefore, in translating Chinese into English, "Chi le ma?" becomes "How are you?"
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So it's no wonder that Xiao was not altogether thrilled when a Chinese publisher suggested in 1990 that he undertake a translation of Ulysses. Pity the poor soul who has to deal with a fairly typical scrap of Ulysses like this one: 
<br>
[Try running it through your machine translator.]
<br>
<br>
Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepy-crawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past. 
<br>
<br>
I asked Judy Arase, a translator, to find this passage in the Chinese translation and then, without reference to Ulysses, translate it from the Chinese back into English. Here's the result: How about laying bare your dagger-like definitions? That which is the nature of a horse is the essence of all horses. They revere the up-down flow and surging-beginning. God: cries in the street. Downright leisure school of thought. Space: the thing you are bound to see. They slowly crawl towards eternity, boring through spaces smaller than man's red blood cells, chasing after Blake's buttocks. This vegetable world is only but its shadow. Hold tightly to the here and now; all of the future shall surge into the past through it. The translation is inventive and carries something of the texture of Joyce's prose. Still, it's not quite the same: for one thing, it's far too intelligible.
<br>
<br>
Wen was undaunted by the complexities; indeed, she was positively eager to take a crack at Joyce. Then sixty-two, and recently retired from a career as a translator of Japanese and the editor of other people's English translations, she felt it was time to put her skills to the test. "In Chinese there is an expression, `Only the head, not the tail'"--meaning that a work has been started but not completed. "For forty years I only polished the translations of others. I never had a chance to translate a famous book, a classic. Why not Ulysses?" Eventually she persuaded her husband that they could crack it together. The project has been an act of teamwork from the beginning, with Wen doing the first draft, Xiao applying the polish, and the two of them arguing over the final version.
<br>
<br>
Beginning in October of 1990 they set the following schedule: Rise at 5:00 each morning (Wen often had to rouse her less committed husband), work until 8:00, and pause for breakfast. Then work until lunch, and again into the late afternoon. Wen worked nights and weekends as well, putting in, she figures, fifteen hours a day just about every day. She even gave up television and newspapers. For two years her sister took over the household, doing the shopping, cooking, and cleaning, so that the couple could work. The sister died in 1992; the translation is dedicated to her memory.
<br>
<br>
The couple leaned heavily on published sources to untangle Joycean knots; they cite Don Gifford's annotated Ulysses as a particular help. They consulted the Chinese Catholic Church, foreign-language specialists, geologists, doctors, and others for specialized knowledge. The Irish Embassy helped with specifically Irish references. What's "blarney"? Wen asked. The answer, as translated: "flattery as usual." And "on the shaughraun"? A drifting state of mind. The embassy also provided reference books, maps of Dublin, and a videotape of the movie version of Ulysses, which was invaluable because Wen and Xiao have never been to Ireland. A Canadian resident in Beijing helped research linguistic oddities like "smutty moll for a mattress jig" --Joycespeak for "prostitute."
<br>
<br>
Xiao and Wen were also able to refer to a work in progress by a man named Jin Di, a Chinese literary scholar now living in the United States, who began his own Chinese translation of Ulysses in 1978 but has not yet seen all of it into print. Bits of Jin's work had been published by the time Xiao and Wen began theirs, and they acknowledge that they saw these, though not the twelve chapters that had appeared in Taiwan by 1993. Jin is somewhat chagrined that he has been working longer and yet is finishing later. But there is room for more than one Chinese translation. The Japanese, after all, are on their fourth. Xiao and Wen do not claim that their work is flawless; they are, however, delighted to have published first. "A gold medal is better than the silver one," Wen says.
<br>
<br>
The work is not, in fact, flawless. A sharp-eyed Chinese reader has pointed out a few mistaken translations from the Latin. More important, sometimes things are just missed. 
<br>
<br>
Molly and her lover, Blazes Boylan, eat Plumtree's Potted Meat during their assignation; the term is translated as "plum tree trademark canned meat." Good enough, but it misses the pun: "potted meat" was Dublin argot for sex. When Leopold recalls Molly's description of the plump Ben Dollard, that his fine singing voice was a "bass barreltone," the translation does not embody the play on words. His voice and shape, she is saying, are derived from barrels of Bass beer. Joyce experimented with different ways of expressing cat sounds: "mkgnao," "mrkgnao," "mrkrgnao," and, prosaically, "miaow." In Chinese, which does not have the array of sounds English has, the characters don't change.
<br>
<br>
Still, Xiao and Wen don't miss much. First, they adapted Chinese-language tools to the challenge. Most Chinese names have three syllables (Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai); the Chinese transliterations of Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus have seven each. Stephen's is rendered phonetically--"Si di fen . Di da le si." The unusual number of characters, the midline period between them, and the use of a few classical (rather than simplified) Chinese characters are all unmistakable signals to the Chinese reader to ignore the meaning and just note that it signifies a name. (A literal translation would be "This-base of a fruit-fragrant. Enlighten-extend-coerce-this.") The practice is similar to using "#%*&amp;!" to indicate a curse in English; a reader doesn't delineate each symbol but just consumes the meaning. Bloom, wandering through a newspaper office, reads in type the name of the friend whose funeral he has just attended: mangiD kcirtaP (Patrick Dignam backward). In Chinese the eight characters used to render the name are likewise reversed. When the moral pub owner, Davy Byrne, "smiledyawnednodded all in one," the issue was trickier. Chinese characters are never smooshed together. Xiao and Wen used a quirk of Chinese grammar that implies simultaneously occurring actions.
<br>
<br>
They also adapted Chinese styles to Joycean ones. Molly, Leopold, and Stephen all have interior monologues, and all sound different. Molly is not very well educated. She occasionally misuses difficult words, and her thoughts, in the famous soliloquy that ends the book, have an earthy resonance. Stephen, the teacher and literary scholar, is philosophical. And Leopold is a middle-class bloke with a big heart who often thinks about sex and bowel movements. So in the Chinese, Molly is rendered in working-class Beijing slang, Stephen mostly in classical Chinese, and Leopold mostly in a mixture of modern and classical that dates from the early twentieth century. By varying the styles, the translation manages to convey the differences in character among the three.
<br>
<br>
When there is no linguistic or literary analogue, which is most of the time, footnotes do the job. So much of Ulysses is built around puns, allusions, and time- and place-specific Irish humor that it really cannot be translated; one must simply plough through. Wen and Xiao made the most readable Chinese translation they could and then explained the Joycean quirks in footnotes--5,991 of them, the most in any Chinese book ever published. Xiao thought that was several thousand too many, but Wen prevailed. The reviews in the Chinese press pay tribute to the couple's thoroughness, and however unwieldly the footnotes may be to read, they are the only way to clue Chinese readers in to Joyce's intentions. 
<br>
<br>
Take the pun on Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway (whose name Joyce misspells, incidentally). The translation reads "If other women are capable of following their hearts for that which they desire, Ann herself has her own ways." A footnote makes the point that the original is a pun on "Ann Hathaway." Sometimes--a lot of the time--the explanations are considerably more complex. T. Lenehan bumps into Bloom at a newspaper office and announces, "Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba." In the Chinese text this is translated "Madam, I'm Adam. And before seeing Eve, I was Abel." The footnote fills in the considerable gaps: These two short sentences can be read the same from either end, joined together by "and." "Eva" [Eve] and "Elba" have similar pronunciations. The sound of Adam and Eve's second-born son, "Abel," is similar to "Able"; the quotation can be read as "Madam, I'm Adam. Before seeing Eve, I was Abel." Another reading comes from mixing together the several elements of Napoleon's saying that there is no "cannot" in his dictionary, his post-defeat banishment to the island of Elba, and his impotence; the first phrase can be reconstituted as "Mad am, I mad am," and the latter as "Before seeing Elba, I did not know the word `cannot.'" "Able" can be understood as "can be done" or "not impotent." Elementary, really.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anthony Burgess, no mean Joyce scholar, has said, "Literature cannot be translated, only the appearance of literature, the arrangement on a page of words which do a minimal job, that of describing action, feelings, and dialogue of a fairly easily translatable kind." True enough, and yet . . . so what? By the Burgess standard, the English-speaking monoglot would be cut off from Tolstoy, Garc&#221;a M&#223;rquez, and Lu Xun. And even if the poetry doesn't always rise, action, feelings, and dialogue count too. One of the joys of Ulysses is just getting lost in the pub talk and the commonplace to-ings and fro-ings of dear, dirty Dublin. The texture may not--cannot--be exactly the same in Chinese as in English, but it is possible to get a rude, true sense of it. 
<br>
<br>
Joyce himself was a gifted linguist who spent his working life as an instructor of languages. He must have known that if Ulysses fulfilled its destiny, it would inevitably find a home beyond English--itself a foreign import to Ireland. In fact, the first translation of Ulysses, a German effort in 1927, came out before the book could be legally published in the United States or Britain. It is difficult to believe that Joyce, hardly parochial in his own work, would frown on the labors of Xiao and Wen. For if Ulysses is the end of literature, as Joyce believed, the remaining eternity must include China, the world's longest-lived civilization. 
<br>
<br>
There are limits, though. No one in China is offering to translate Finnegans Wake.

There's the problem, isn't it? Am I being cynical, do you think, if I suggest that applying the fruits of a century of modern descriptive linguistics to translation and interpreting is just too tough a test for where the linguists have got to?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have to say I'm rather disappointed. The only responses I've had about computers and spoken translation (i.e. interpreting into and out of SPEECH) have either led off (fasinatingly) into the problems of literary TRANSLATION (i.e. written texts) or have (like the one below) focused on rubbishing Searle. 
<br>
<br>
True or not, Searle's Chinese Room argument is NOT what I'm talking about. Presumably, the response was generated by the word 'Searle' and it was that that triggered off the reply about the argument.
<br>
<br>
Let me explain. The Searle I am talking about is the philosopher of language J. R. Searle who wrote (in 1969) an eminently sensible book called 'Speech Acts' in which he attempted to direct the attention of linguists away from Chomskian TG syntax (with a bit of semantics thrown in in 1965 in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax)and onto pragmatics: situated communication. The book had an enormous impact but not so much in 'core' linguistics as in sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics and, hugely, in applied linguistics where it led to communicative syllabuses and far more learner friendly learning activities. The whole effect of THAT Searle's writing was extremely exciting and humanising for language teaching and learning.
<br>
<br>
Now I don't care what the Searle of 199+ says or said or is saying about machines thinking etc. I am no philosopher and the issue of whether what is doing the translating in the Chinese room is thinking or not is of very secondary importance to me. 
<br>
<br>
You may find this unacceptable and tell me that I OUGHT to care but I have to say, remember that I'm a practical teacher trainer faced by the immediate task of helping people to learn languages. The analogy I'd like to use is that of the successful driving instructor: if my learners pass their tests, does it matter if they know the principles of the internal combustion engine or the laws of physics and mechanics which drive (pun!) the car? 
<br>
<br>
Teaching them this isn't precluded in a driving course (and I do teach my students some linguistics) but isn't that just an added bonus and not essential to driving a car in  a way which obeys the rules and is appropriate in the conditions in which the driver finds him/herself?
<br>
<br>
Now back to my question. The test I'm after is not Chinese rooms but a SPEAKER of Chinese and a speaker of English who share no common language and wish to communicate. I'll mark them C and E in the extremely truncated simulation of a little conversation below:
<br>
<br>
<br>
C (in Chinese) Would you like a cup of tea?
<br>
<br>
E (in English) Yes please.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's the test I want to apply. 
<br>
<br>
Do C and E, face to face, in a context in which the initial question is not crazy (i.e. there actually IS tea available and something to drink it out of)HEAR what is said to them as English and Chinese respectively and is that C/E grammatically correct and communicatively appropriate? (does it, like the successful driver, obey the rules - of the language - and suit the social conditions of the exchange?)
<br>
<br>
Do the words of C constitute (in Searle 1969's terms)the issuing of a speech act of 'offering'  which the computer turns into different words (in English) which count as an equivalent speech act? i.e. the offering of a cup of tea (in the xample above). 
<br>
<br>
Does E recognise the communicative value of what C (through the computer) has said? 
<br>
<br>
If (s)he does, (s)he will know that the expected response is either to issue a speech act which counts as acceptance or rejection. 
<br>
<br>
Does what E says which C hears in Chinese (again via the computer) count as an acceptance (in this case of a cup of tea)? 
<br>
<br>
Very pragmatically, does E get the cup of tea or not? 
<br>
<br>
If E gets a bowl of rice or C gets a punch in the teeth, the system isn't working adequately but if my test is passed, to the satisfaction of the two speakers (who do not need to be philosophers, AI experts or anything other than just ordinary people), I am satisfied. 
<br>
<br>
If the answer is NO, I would like to know when (if ever) this is likely to happen.
<br>
<br>
I have taken the advice I have been given (for which thanks)and am ensuring that my pants have not fallen down without my realising and I haven't given up my day job but I still have heard no hard arguments either way which help me resolve the problem. 
<br>
<br>
All I've had so far have been assertions in favour or against the possibility/practicality of such a system.
<br>
<br>
Could someone, please, try and answer MY question? There are over 4000 languages in the world. Ten of these have over 100 million native speakers. International communication is increasingly dominated by a much smaller number. Babel is here. What do we do? Is the Babel fish hooked and being hauled in or still swimming in Chinese rooms full of water (i.e. goldfish bowls)?
<br>
<br>
My goldfish can so far only say his name 'Bob' (they all think they're called Bob)but is looking forword to some multilingual IT help to extend his communicative competence.

<br>
<br>
It seems that to answer your question properly, one must make assumptions about the "sophistication" of this babelfish.
<br>
<br>
It it were merely programmed with some "E-word maps to C-word" translation, it would be hopelessly inadequate, I think you would agree.
<br>
<br>
(Aside, we must assume that the babelfish, at least, properly "hears" the input words.  If the speaker is mumbling, even a perfect human translator will have difficulty, right?)
<br>
<br>
In English (at least) we often follow a sentence in which one or more nouns were made explicit, with another sentence employing pronouns.  Clearly, the bablefish will need to maintain a bit of the "history of the conversation" in order to disambiguate certain phrases in the given context.  Even two English speakers can get confused when too many pronouns pile up, and the bablefish would fare no better under such circumstances.
<br>
<br>
Finally (in order to do a really superb job) the babelfish needs to "understand" the logical relationships between thousands of real-world "things", as a further disambiguation mechanism.  
<br>
<br>
  "The book was read/red"
<br>
<br>
Are we speaking about color?
<br>
<br>
  "The book was read/red out loud"
<br>
<br>
Aha, we are NOT referring to the color... etc.
<br>
<br>
I firmly believe ALL of this will come about.  How soon, and at what cost, is a matter of some real debate.
<br>
<br>
(Am I one the right track with your question?)
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

<br>
<br>
I think what we have come to is this:
<br>
<br>
1. Context is the crucial feature
<br>
2. Meaning lies in the context not in language. Someone (forget who) said 'Meanings are in people, not in words' 
<br>
3. We learn to relate meaning in to meaning person to person in context. The language facilitates this. There are(says Dell Hymes)rules of use without the rules of usage (i.e. grammar) would be, literally useless.
<br>
4. How can/when will the computer learn to find contextual meaning?  
<br>
5. How can it get the practice it needs? 
<br>
<br>
Any of the AI people have answers to 4 and 5?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt; 4. How can/when will the computer learn to find contextual meaning? 
<br>
<br>
Computer has to simulate the outside world. Just as we do. We simulate a large portion of what MIGHT somebody think, when saying this or that. What (visual) pictures might go along with her talking, what she is going to do.
<br>
<br>
We are not always very good at this, so not need computer to be, but that is, what the language is all about. A simulation language for the (social) world is the natural language.
<br>
<br>
We would need 100 years or so, to teach the computer program to do that. But when things go automatization - 10 years from now.
<br>
<br>
IMHO.

What do I mean with the automatization of the language learning process.
<br>
<br>
First you have a random world&amp;language model. You test, how often your model sees in the pictures on the net, what is written bellow them. 
<br>
<br>
Then you randomly do some child model of the first model and see which do the best.
<br>
<br>
After some generations, you get a working model, which understands (many) language(s) and recognizes the pictures and sounds.
<br>
<br>
Simple, isn't it? You do need a substantial amount of CPU, that's right.

I've typed the address very diligently and carefully but, no luck.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The important thing about speech in face-to-face situations is the redundancy of language.  You are not dealing with just vocabulary and syntax, although these become more important as the communication becomres more complex.  But you are also dealing with facial expression, body language, tone of vocie, gestures, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
For example, if your face-to-face speakers are sitting in the kitchen or the living room next to a pot of tea and two cups (environment being one of the primary elements of redundancy) and C gestures with his hand toward the pot and says, "Ni yau i bei cha ma?"  all the while smiling and nodding in the direction of E, I'm pretty sure E will come back with something like "Yes, I'd like that." which C would not understand on a vocabulary basis, but would see by the nodding of E's head, the smile on his face, and the way he leans forward as he speaks that pouring tea into the cup is the proper thing to do.  At the same time, E would no doubt pick up the information that "cha" probably means "tea" and file it away until the next time he hears the word in a similar situation.  C will pick up on the word "yes" and do the same.
<br>
<br>
Language is based largely on expectation and we tend to hear what we expect to hear.  What we expect to hear also depends on the environment and situation.  Therefore, language is an adjunct to that environment and is supplemented by the years of learning not only vocabulary but also what is expected in the roles people play in various situations.  In other words, the culture of both the speaker and the listener.  The role and the situation are both elements of the language and culture we know or wish to learn.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if that answers your question or not, but it's the spoken language situation as I see it after many years of teaching English to Chinese students in Taiwan.  I usually summarize my experience by telling them that you learn what you practice.  If you practice thinking and speaking you will learn to speak.  If you practice listening, you will learn to hear and understand.  And if you practice doing little exercises out of a book, that's what you'll learn how to do.  
<br>
<br>
Language is a skill.  Like any skill, our ability to do it depends a lot on when we started learning (Tiger Woods started playing golf at age four) and how much time we spend practicing the skill we want to learn.  Language skills are also separate from each other.  Speaking is a different skill from listening or reading and writing.  There is some crossover but you shouldn't expect that skill in one will automatically carry over to the others.  They are separate skills and use different parts of the brain and the body.  
<br>
<br>
Learning to catch a ball won't teach you much about throwing one, but it's hard to do one without also doing the other.  That applies to language as much as it applies to ball playing.</p></td>

The problem (and I suppose we need a philosopher to tell us whether this is just an 'in practice' one or 'in principle')is the model. 
<br>
<br>
I have spent forty years looking at such models (not computer ones though)as a major challenge for sociolinguistics and we've got somewhere but it's been very very slow.
<br>
<br>
Are you thinking of a culturally and linguistically aware adult acting as the 'expert' inthe creation of an expert system? Is this the sort of line that is being followed? If so, I will seriously think about giving up my day job and applying for that!

<br>
<br>
There are several roads to the Singularity. More or less parallel. One would be suficient, but there is more than one way.
<br>
<br>
Let me mention two!
<br>
<br>
The digital simulation. We are about to simulate the real physics.  Instead of doing experiments which processor behaves better or has better performance, we will be able to simulate any physical machine (for example a CPU), how it behaves, inside a (super)computer.
<br>
<br>
We will not begin with the processors, but with the atomic bombs, for example. At first, the simulation couldn't match with the real blow up of an A bomb.  But soon, it will reveal more and faster, than a real explosion would.
<br>
<br>
The observation with simulation, will soon be more comfortabe, faster and informative, than any classical observation.
<br>
<br>
Now, we are already employing the automatic checkings and controls. And even adjusting the parameters of a simulation.
<br>
<br>
The digital evolution of those parameters inside the program, is also an already well known method.
<br>
<br>
Now those two - simulation and evolution combined - will become one fast road to ever better products, in almost any area of human endeavour. It is even self propeled and accerelated process. What we need, is some critical density of this technology - and we are on!
<br>
<br>
From supercomputers, drugs, RAMs, bridges, jet engines ... to algorithms or programs ... we will do that way. 
<br>
<br>
Where does it stop? On the other side of the Singularity somewhere - I guess.
<br>
<br>
This is the shortest path from here to the Singularity - I think.
<br>
<br>
How far is it? Not very. How fast it will go? Faster and faster.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I happen to work at the lab where the "ASCI White" (Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative) machine, roughly the most powerful computer on earth, does its simulation stuff.  Not my area (I do R&amp;D for network/information security with CIAC.)
<br>
<br>
They do simulations of chemical and nuclear reactions all the time, even with lesser machines.  The issue is how finely one can detail the smallest interactions in sufficient number to get results that mirror what would happen physically.  Certain weapons-grade materials decay naturally, and neutron flux weakens surrounding materials, so all of these things are fair game for simulation, when you cannot do "real" testing.
<br>
<br>
These machines also simulate the details of varied models of turbulence, global weather stuff, etc.
<br>
<br>
The are breaking ground for a new facility called the "Terascale Computing Facility", expected to house a system 100-1000 times as powerfile as ASCI White. (By 2005, or so, I think.)
<br>
<br>
I would like to see them applying such power to areas more interesting than simulating explosions.  There are other areas of "strategic concern".  Of course, for all I know, they may use it to analyse all network traffic and deduce who all the players are, not by the "handles" they go by, but by a thousand other clues we leave behind.
<br>
<br>
I would like to see that power applied to AI, but that is likely not a high priority, despite the DARPA call for "intelligent" systems.

When one masters A bomb simulations, everything else - like nano robot simulations - will just follow as a business opportunity driven commercialization.
<br>
<br>
1000 times more CPU than today, is just staggering.
<br>
<br>
So, shortly after 2005, we should be able to simulate the CPU (parts) - for example. 
<br>
<br>
To get some more CPU power. And so on. Byproducts like drugs and machines, will be money driven necessity - I guess.

What am I doing now? Just simulating the near future inside my head - of course.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Thomas,
<br>
<br>
There is an important difference between simulating a thermonuclear explosion, and (say) correctly simulating even a a single E. Coli cell.
<br>
<br>
A long history of carefully "smashing particles", a few at a tome, in accelerators, has yielded details about the mass, energies, spins, and forces of their internal "structures" (gluon/quark/hadron...) and so forth, allowing very accurate predictions to be made about how "small numbers" of such things would interact.  Armed with accurate "small-numbers" information, one then applies "huge simulations" to examine how these effects interact when billions are (simulated) to get compressed together.
<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying this is simple.  It is complex, scores of particle types and multiple forces with differing effects/ranges, etc.
<br>
<br>
But compared to the complexity of a single biological cell, it is simple indeed.  In order to accurately simulate a single living sell IN DETAIL, you need to do the equivalent of the "atom smashing", and understand the "small-numbers" information.  But even the simplest protein molecule is far more complex than a simple nucleus of uranium or plutonium, and the number of different types of protein molecules is enormous.  Internal cellular structures like ribosomes are another order or two of greater magnitude in complexity, etc.  And the living cell is a virtual city of thousands of such structures.  They cannot be simulated with any accuracy by just guessing, willy-nilly, at their individual interaction types, forces, forms, etc.  This "small-numbers information" must be garnered first, in order to feed the model, and have anything emulating "biology in detail" appear as a result.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, although we understand the detailed QM behaviors of atoms and subatomic stuff, and the "classical physics" of large scale stuff, the forces at work in the "middle regime" were both QM and classical behaviors manifest is only beginning to be explored.  New "Operating Principles" for this regime are being discovered all the time, and this is the "scale of the nanobots".  So we need to understand this "physics" in order to give the computer something to "simulate with".
<br>
<br>
My complaint:  We are employing these very huge (and very expensive) machines to simulate the "very simple, in huge scale" (what happens when you pound sand with a really big hammer) as opposed to simulating the relatively complex and interesting (self-evolving genetic algorithms, etc.)
<br>
<br>
Huge machines to support huge simulations is a great research tool, but using it to simulate a trillion simultaneous games of tic-tac-toe is not likely to lead to the singularity...  :(

QM is just enough to operate with. You need a midscale physics just as an optimization tool.
<br>
<br>
A nanorobot can be modeled by the today knowledge of physics. There is nothing - except that a lot of computing is to be performed - what can prevent us from simulating any molecule tower.
<br>
<br>
We have some partial solutions inside (bio) chemistry, like those you have mentioned as the accelerator data in (sub)atomic physics. We will be able to employ this simulation/evolution technique in a few years, I am quite confident. 
<br>
<br>
Jet engines,  turbines, alloys ... are just the humble begging.
<br>
<br>
The living cell may be reachable in 10 or so years. After several improvements will be made - in tools.
<br>
<br>
That is my whole point.

Who says anything about donating? I know you would donate. I am donating it all the time to some distributed computing effort. Don't know and don't care what they are really doing.
<br>
<br>
But we are in a minority.
<br>
<br>
When the time will be right (soon) for a massive AI internet computing, it should have a bait!
<br>
<br>
"We will tip you for a good stock purchase (or something of that kind) - every time you will donate us a trillion CPU ops. Here is the history of our tips and statistics. THIS AI is 30% commited to those calculation, 70% to some important stuff ... blah, blah, blah ..."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Something like that!
<br>
<br>
This way, it will be possible to buy 10^17 ops in 2005.

I don't know for any link to the simulation (evolution) driven Singularity. It's nothing more than my (rational) bet.

Our thinking is nothing else, than "what if" simulations. And if we can do it inside computer faster and better - the thinking business will go there, I would say.

&gt; "All of human culture and civilization is based on symbol manipulation."
<br>
One might frame the "great symbol/semantic" debate in terms of whether it should be "based on", or "interpreted in terms of".
<br>
<br>
Let me play a bit of Devil's Advocate (or at least explore both sides of the issue, since I don't claim to have answers.)
<br>
<br>
Clearly, all humans (and thus human culture/civilization) are "based on" chemistry.  Since human culture requires humans, and humans would support no culture if not for "brains", culture is based upon brains, and brains in turn upon chemistry.
<br>
<br>
One could also characterize culture as "humans involved in "meaning exchange", however this might occur.
<br>
<br>
Since brains (somehow) entertain "meaning", and have evolved to the point of rationality, we can create categories, and VIEW the world in terms of "objects and relations".
<br>
<br>
Thus, however we exchange "meaning" (and however it might be based upon chemistry), we are free to INTERPRET this activity in terms of symbols, and the manipulation of symbols.  This description is a conceptual abstraction of something that is nonetheless "physically happening" when humans exchange "meaning".
<br>
<br>
The question thus becomes, if we create artificial systems that conform (only) to match our conceptualization of "culture" in terms of symbol manipulation, is this "as good" as real culture?  Do the artificial actors originate "real meaning"?
<br>
<br>
And if they become so advanced that they "seem to" originate meaning and develop culture, do we (humans) have any particular right to denigrate these entities, simply because we happen to understand their origins?
<br>

<br>
<br>
To paraphrase Bill Clinton, it all depends on what you mean by "based on."
<br>
<br>
What I meant when I used it was that without symbols and symbol manipulation we would not have a culture.  The symbols I was referring to are the symbols we call memes and words.  Without these, we would have a primate we call homo sapiens (but not very sapient), but we wouldn't have culture and civilization.  
<br>
<br>
&gt;The question thus becomes, if we create artificial systems that conform (only) to match our conceptualization of "culture" in terms of symbol manipulation, is this "as good" as real culture? Do the artificial actors originate "real meaning"? 
<br>
<br>
&gt;And if they become so advanced that they "seem to" originate meaning and develop culture, do we (humans) have any particular right to denigrate these entities, simply because we happen to understand their origins? 
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you mean by "real culture."  To the best of my knowledge, I've never met an artificial culture.  As to symbol manipulation, this is just the tool we use to build the institutions of culture.  The answer to "Do artificial actors originate "real meaning?" the answer is no.  The person who creates these actors and the acts they perform originates the meaning.  But the actors can pass real meaning on to the audience taking in their performance.  Any ad you see on television provides you with real meaning although the characters saying the words may just be cartoons.  The ad tells you, basically, why you should buy a product and where you are likely to find it.  That is real information and the symbols used convey real meaning.  Not deep, by any means, but real.  In this case, the actors themselves are symbols (think Smoky the Bear or Tony the Tiger) and represent part of the meaning conveyed.
<br>
<br>
It is difficult for nonhuman actors to originate real meaning because every move they make is scripted and controlled by humans.  Therefore it is the humans who create the meaning.  A human actor can add meaning to a script by interpreting the words and using them in conjunction with unscripted body language, facial expression, and intonation to add meaning that was not intended by the writer of the script.  The actions of an artificial actor are scripted as much as the words it says.  Therefore, any meaning conveyed comes from the humans who did the scripting, not from the actor itself.
<br>
<br>
This also happens when a director is overly manipulative in directing the actions of a human actor.  I'm reminded of a story in which an actor was frustrated by such a director and told him, "God dammit, give me my balls back!"  Instead of answering, the director looked over at his assistant and yelled, "Props!"
<br>
<br>
When artificial actors become capable of making their own decisions about what symbols to use based on their own interpretation of how those symbols should be manipulated to accomplish the objective of adding meaning and passing that meaning on to the audience, they too will be creating meaning.
<br>
<br>
Humans, by the way, have the right to denigrate anything they feel like denigrating.  That merely reveals more about the human than what they are talking about.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Indeed.  That is also my view.  Perhaps I was not clear when I used the term "artificial actor".  I mean "something we consciously create" that serves to interact "as a being".
<br>
<br>
The issue of symbol manipulation is harder to see when, for instance, you might convey an idea to me (in person), and I react not by speaking, but by shifting my weight, furrowing my brow, etc.  These are not distinct "symbols" and may bleed into one another, yet some sense of "meaning" is still conveyed.
<br>
<br>
Speaking to "robo-culture", I try to imagine a world where the original "intelligent species" had perished, but only aftyer having created AI-robot-like entities whose (initial) tasking might be simply to "gain knowledge and produce order" (pick something better if you like).  Initially embedded as a literal "directive", over many robo-generations (robots designing better successors) the actual directive may no longer "exist as code", but rather become effectively present because of the way their "society" has become organized.  The initial directive helped to provide the constraints which led to certain organizational structures over others, but now, it is those very forms of organization that "embody" the directive.
<br>
<br>
If we were to happen upon this world, we might see variety of behaviors that appear meaningful, and even exhibit cultural differentiation due to local circumstance.  It is no longer "obvious", nor perhaps entirely ascertainable what the "program" is intended to be doing.  Even the originating "creators" might not recognize this system of "beings" as derived from their original instructions.
<br>
<br>
Thus, hard to say wherein "meaning" arises.
<br>

<br>
Meaning is something the mind manufactures out of the input from the body's senses.  A sunset is beautiful because a viewer's mind makes it so.  When a person tries to convey what his mind has manufactured, he uses symbols to do it.  What gets transferred will be a mixture of the first mind's creation and what the receiver's mind creates from the new input of data from the first mind.  Only a portion of the meaning projected from the first mind will make it to the second mind as it will be modified by the sights and sounds that accompany it.  
<br>
<br>
For example, when I say something to someone, my thoughts are conveyed through a montage of facial expressions, body language, words, shaping of the sounds that convey the words, and the listener's past experience with the person who is saying them as well as his/her experience with the words being used in the communication.  
<br>
<br>
In addition, you have to take into account the setting in which the words are said as well as such things as the emotions being generated by the setting and the people involved in the transaction.  
<br>
<br>
Cyrano said, "There are a thousand ways to say 'I love you.'"  A man who is crazy drunk and saying it to a frightened wife while holding her throat in one hand and a pistol to her head with the other will convey a much different meaning than the man who says it while giving her roses and a gentle kiss on the lips.
<br>
<br>
Meaning, therefore, like beauty, is more in the eye of the beholder than in the words of the speaker.
<br>

i say vote on sites, vote on the internet. how sites should be, the colors, the chosen words, the animations, what options there should be. one can imagine this being intrusive towards webmasters, but who cares and i really mean -who- cares, not even the webmasters themselves if they too can determine the shape of the (rest of) the internet which can then positively influence the world
<br>
<br>
&gt; I am writing in the hopes that someone would give me a straight answer to a straight question: 
<br>
Is it possible or not that we will soon have adequate CAT spoken translation between natural languages? 
<br>
<br>
i would say its almost a 'straight question'
<br>
<br>
&gt; I doubt that Searle argued that machines can only maipulate sysbols, but only that symbol manipulation alone would never produce understanding. 
<br>
<br>
i think what Searle really is saying is that he doesnt understand understanding. who does -- now what may be annoying is that too flawed logic isnt boycotted enough
<br>
<br>
&gt; Who says anything about donating? I know you would donate. I am donating it all the time to some distributed computing effort. Don't know and don't care what they are really doing. 
<br>
<br>
then you trust them enough. but nobody really does
<br>
<br>
one more note on internet layouts and writings: simply mentioning any word like 'die' is offensive. and any letter, the shape of it. and anagrams and anything you can imagine. so to keep things simple and correct, i would say keep it at a level that doesnt avoid too many things. am i preaching? you bet your ass i am. but im not saying anything we already dont know

<br>
<br>
1.  Searle builds the case saying the computer is receiving and responding with language symbols, but he builds his case as if they were actually math symbols.  With math, a given set of inputs (operators and values) can always produce a valid output.  His case breaks down with language, where as Kurzweil describes, complete language understanding requires at least human level intelligence.
<br>
<br>
2.  Let's not throw away the human in the room.  In his current role, he is merely feeding data into the computer and taking it back out.  However, think of a real human in that role, one with curiosity and a desire to learn.  No doubt, over time he will begin to see patterns in the data that he passes back and forth.  Given the way Chinese characters are designed this is almost a certainty:  the symbol for "forest" is the same as 3 symbols for "tree", and the symbol for "tree" does vaguely resemble an actual tree, etc.  However, even if these patterns did not exist, the repeated use of certain symbols would eventually suggest meanings, and given enough repetitions, the human could be expected to learn the language, and eventually to understand the questions and responses.  Who is to say that a second computer, replacing the human, could not be programmed to perform the same search for patterns and to learn the language?  Considering the computer's superior memory, it might be expected to learn it faster than the human.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Your suggestion of teaching a computer to look for symbols in the Chinese Room is interesting in this context.  But remember that the CRA argument is supposed to apply to any algorithm, including pattern recognition.  So as I see it, you'd have to consider a room *within* a room if a computer is searching for language patterns, to be fair to this analogy.
<br>
<br>
We return to the question of whether mechanical pattern recognition can actually become understanding.  Seems like you've made it a RECURSIVE question.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the real problem with the CRA is that Searle assumes that a computer can be no more sophisticated than the person following rules in the example.  This assumption is used in the conclusion: that Strong AI cannot exist, i.e. machines can never think/understand.  In Kurzweil's words,
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  the "man" in the room doesn&#314;t understand anything because, after all, "he is just a computer," thereby illuminating Searle&#314;s own bias. Searle then concludes&#346;no surprise&#346;that the computer doesn&#314;t understand.  </p></center> </p></td>

The correct analogy as noted is of course that the ROOM is the computer/brain.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote"> [Ray Kurzweil] insists that they [the machines] will claim to be conscious . . . and consequently their claims will be largely accepted. People will eventually just come to accept without question that machines are conscious. But this misses the point. I can already program my computer so that it says that it is conscious&#346;i.e., it prints out &#244;I am conscious&#246;&#346;and a good programmer can even program it so that it will carry on a rudimentary argument to the effect that it is conscious. But that has nothing to do with whether or not it really is conscious.
<br>
<br>
Searle fails to point out that I make exactly the same point, and further that I refer not to such idle claims that are easily feasible today but rather to the convincing claims of future machines. As one example of many, I write in my book (p. 60) that these claims &#244;won&#314;t seem like a programmed response. The machines will be earnest and convincing. </p></center>
<br>
Well it appears to me that Kurzweil is missing Searle's point, which is: whether AI is really conscious, or just seems that way, are two different issues.
<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that as Kurzweil suggests "The machines will be earnest and convincing."  But again, so what?  If your wife convinces you that her adultery is merely in your imagination, does that mean she is not cheating on you?  A trompe l'oeil painting appears quite convincing, until you try to walk through it.
<br>
<br>
So AI may be the best illusion yet achieved, making us think something that is completely false because we are "convinced."
<br>
<br>
The issue that applies to the "idle claims" Kurzweil objects to applies to the "convincing claims" as well, and is not answered by Kurzweil as far as I can tell.
<br>
<br>
There are no shortage of credulous people convinced of many strange things.  That doesn't make the object of their powerful beliefs real.
<br>
<br>
That is the point I think Searle was making, and which I think Kurzweil was missing.
