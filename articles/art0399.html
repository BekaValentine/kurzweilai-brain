<div class="TeaserText">Electronicmusic.com talks with <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> pioneer <a class="thought" href="entries/moog_entry.html">Robert Moog</a> about how he radically changed the way music is made, and the tools he used to do it.</div>

<p>Originally published March 1997 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011122336/http://www.electronicmusic.com/" target="_new">electronicmusic.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net January 29, 2002.</p>
<p>electronicmusic.com: Was there one defining moment while developing your first <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> that you realized it had the potential to radically change the way music is made?</p>
<p>Bob Moog: No, there was no one defining moment. I got into designing <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> music composition equipment because I liked working with creative musicians, people who were always looking for new ways of making music. I worked with a lot of musicians, and each one made his or her own contribution to our <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> design <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>What were the major technical problems you encountered when designed the first prototypes?</p>
<p>The first circuits were pretty simple, actually. The only thing was that the pitch wasn't very accurate in the early prototypes. That didn't bother us at the time, because we were working with composers who didn't care that much about pitch accuracy. Only after our synthesizers became commercially important and our customers wanted to produce conventional melodies did we realize that we would have to clean up and stabilize our voltage-controlled oscillators.</p>
<p>Did you ever intend for the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> to become a constituent part of an orchestra, purposefully trying to develop filters that would in some way emulate existing orchestral instruments?</p>
<p>No way. We kept telling people that our equipment was designed to make new sounds, not to emulate existing orchestral instruments. In fact, the filters that we developed were distinctly <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>-sounding. Orchestral instruments have formant characteristics that are very different from sounds that are shaped by our filters.</p>
<p>One of the most popular sounds produced by early mass produced synthesizers seems to have been the sound of strings. Is this a particularly easy sound to create?</p>
<p>The early 'string synthesizers' used conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> organ <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in combination with 'bucket brigade' <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> delay lines which time-shifted the tones, then remixed them to simulate string ensembles. It's a more complex way of making musical sounds than you would normally find in an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> organ of the '70's, but it was a lot simpler than our <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>I once had the pleasure of playing a modular Moog <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> in a studio in London and remember wondering which module actually came first. The VCA is, I would have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, at the heart of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> but how did you decide what to build next? Was the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> developed at the same time?</p>
<p>My very first prototype (early 1964) consisted of two VCO's and one VCA, period. With that amount of stuff, a tape recorder, and some simple mixing and equalizing equipment, you could make a variety of new sounds that seemed absolutely amazing at the time. Next came ADSR envelope generators, envelope followers, and a simple keyboard controller. The VCF didn't come for another couple of years.</p>
<p>Do you still have the original blueprints of the your first synthesizers?</p>
<p>I'm afraid not. I have some hand sketches that I made as part of our development work, but the formal drawings were kept by the people who took Moog <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> over when I left.</p>
<p>When you're not at work in your workshop what do you like to do? do you have any hobbies or pastimes?</p>
<p>I'm basically a family man. I like gardening, hiking and reading.</p>
<p>When can we see a Bob Moog film biography? Everyone I know <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> you were great in the Theremin film. Have you been approached by anyone in Hollywood?</p>
<p>I was in one other film. It was called The Visionaries and produced in the '70's by the United States <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Agency. It contained five minute segments on six different inventors, one of whom was me. It was shown around the world where it was seen by millions of people, but the USA did not allow it to be shown in this country. Aside from that and the Theremin documentary, I haven't been in any films.</p>
<p>In the Theremin documentary you said something to the effect of "....the Theremin being a very highly tuned <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, making full use of what little workings there are inside its wooden cabinet.....". What did you mean by this and how can we get back to producing instruments that work on the same principles?</p>
<p>Back in those days, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> components were big and expensive. It was the designer's job to figure out how to accomplish a specific function with the absolute minimum of components. The RCA theremin <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> contains seven or eight <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> tubes, maybe a couple of dozen resistors and capacitors, a few transformers and inductors, and almost nothing else. But each tube is a large, delicate, expensive <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>. In contrast, a typical modern <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> may contain hundreds or thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> components, all of which fit on a tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chip. If you take <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> into account, a 1929 <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a> cost much, much more than a typical 1997 <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>. I think it's hard to 'get back to producing instruments that work on the same principles', because the components that are available to us are already extremely complex, and some of the basic old-timey components are simply no longer available. A good example is the variable capacitor. This <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> is electrically simple, but it's large and mechanically complex. They are no longer used as the tuning elements of radios. Instead, we have pushbutton switches that increment a frequency <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>, which is electrically sophisticated and complex, but small and cheap to mass-produce.</p>
<p>I understand you were at the NAMM exhibition in Anaheim this January, what were you doing there and what new instruments and devices can we expect to see from you in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>?</p>
<p>I attended the NAMM show to see my many industry friends, and to see what's new. I also went to help my friend and colleague David Van Koevering to launch his new line of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> home piano instruments. The Van Koevering instruments have highly interactive touch-screen-controlled graphical user interfaces.</p>
<p>The next Big Briar product will be a state-of-the-art <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> theremin, which we'll introduce this coming summer. After that, who knows? There's a good chance that we'll develop some new <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> products.</p>
<p>According to a growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of music journalists the next "big thing" on the popular music horizon is music created almost entirely with <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical instruments, and we hope to see some new Moog products among those used! Are you excited that modern music has developed the way it has since the introduction of the Moog and what do you see way out there in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? Are there any technological surprises coming our way?</p>
<p>I don't think that there are any big surprises relating to sound-production <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. However, I do believe that we will see some major advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based music production and performance systems. Even right now, you can fit a complex sound <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> on a card that can fit into your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. And, if you have a pentium-class <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, you can use the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> itself to make musical sounds. With a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> between the sound-producing <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> and the musician, you can <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> a very wide range of application-specific "virtual instruments". In fact, we will certainly get back to the ideas of the '60's and '70's that excited experimental musicians around the world. Back then, musicians were really turned on by the idea that you could organize a whole <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of music production instruments to meet your specific creative needs.</p>
<p>With respect to new 'Moog' products, we plan to introduce products under the Moog name in the very near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. These products will use <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that I am familiar with, and that I helped to develop. But they will also make good use of <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> and other <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> protocols.</p>
<p>Interview conducted via e-mail between Paul Clark and <a class="thought" href="entries/moog_entry.html">Robert Moog</a>, March 1997.</p>
