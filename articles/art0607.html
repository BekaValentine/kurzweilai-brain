<div class="TeaserText">Molecular manufacturing requires more than mechanochemistry. A single nanoscale fabricator cannot build macro-scale products. This paper describes the mechanisms, structures, and processes of a prototypical macro-scale, programmable nanofactory composed of many small fabricators. Power requirements, control of mechanochemistry, reliability in the face of radiation damage, convergent assembly processes and joint mechanisms, and product design are discussed in detail, establishing that the design should be capable of duplicating itself. Nanofactory parameters are derived from plausible fabricator parameters. The pre-design of a nanofactory and many products appears to be within today's capabilities. Bootstrapping issues are discussed briefly, indicating that nanofactory development might occur quite soon after fabricator development. Given an assembler, a nanofactory appears feasible and worthwhile, and should be accounted for in assembler policy discussions.</div>

<h2>1.&#160;&#160; Introduction </h2>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> of a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> depends on many factors, including 
              the difficulty of development and the ease and cost of use.&#160; 
              Most technologies require significant additional work to form useful 
              products.&#160; Previous theoretical work in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              has provided only incomplete and fragmentary answers to the question 
              of how molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s can be used in practice.&#160; 
              Although it appears that fabrication <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can be built on a nanometer 
              scale (Drexler, 1992), small devices will be difficult to use directly 
              in many applications.&#160; Several designs have been proposed in 
              more or less detail (Drexler, 1986, 1992; Bishop, 1996; Merkle, 
              1997a; Hall, 1999; Freitas and Merkle, in press) for parallel control 
              of many small fabricators to make a large product.&#160; Other proposals 
              (Hall, 1993) combine many small products to create a large product.&#160; 
              However, each of these proposals has provided insufficient detail 
              to allow estimation of their practical difficulty and utility. </p>
<p>This paper builds on previous proposals to describe an <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> 
              for combining large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable mechanochemical fabricators 
              into a manufacturing system, or <i>nanofactory,</i> capable of producing 
              a wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale products.&#160; The proposed system 
              is described in sufficient detail to allow estimation of nanofactory 
              mass, volume, power requirements, reliability, fabrication <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 
              and product capability and cost, as simple functions of the properties 
              of the mechanochemical fabricator <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>.&#160; Bootstrapping 
              a human-scale system from a sub-micron system is also discussed.&#160; 
              Discussion of product design issues and nanofactory manufacturing 
              capability demonstrates that the nanofactory should be able to efficiently 
              fabricate duplicates of itself as well as larger versions.&#160; 
              This proposal differs from previous proposals in that, with the 
              exception of mechanochemical component fabrication, design of the 
              nanofactory should be within the reach of present-day <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering; 
              physical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s and functional requirements are described in 
              sufficient detail that remaining problems should be within the capability 
              of current engineering practice to solve.&#160; In particular, the 
              design considers all transport and manipulation requirements for 
              raw materials and product components, as well as control, power, 
              and cooling issues. </p>
<p>This exploration can provide a basis for estimating the practical 
              value and difficulty of developing a nanofactory.&#160; As noted 
              in (Merkle, 1999), even a primitive sub-micron mechanochemical fabricator 
              may produce valuable products.&#160; The question at hand is whether, 
              once such a device is developed, it is feasible and worthwhile to 
              adapt such devices into a nanofactory.&#160; Since no complete designs, 
              or even complete <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> sets, exist for a mechanochemical fabricator, 
              this question cannot be answered fully at this time.&#160; However, 
              the results of the present paper can be applied to a wide range 
              of hypothetical fabricator parameters.&#160; As fabricator designs 
              are proposed in increasing detail, these results will become increasingly 
              useful in predicting the capabilities of a nanofactory based on 
              such designs.&#160; Issues of product design and manufacture are 
              examined in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to establish that the nanofactory is capable of 
              fabricating duplicates and larger versions of itself.&#160; The 
              time required to bootstrap a human-scale factory from a nano-scale 
              fabricator cannot be estimated with any certainty, since bootstrapping 
              will require time for <a class="thought" href="entries/debugging_entry.html">debugging</a> and redesign as well as for fabrication 
              of larger versions.&#160; However, the minimum time required for 
              fabrication can be estimated, and the design developed here is simple 
              enough that debugging and redesign may be fairly simple and rapid. 
            </p>

<h2>2.&#160;&#160; Background </h2>
<p>In order to create useful products with molecular manufacturing, 
              several steps are required.&#160; Large products cannot be built 
              by a single small fabricator.&#160; Even at a million atoms per 
              second, building a gram of product would take more than a billion 
              years.&#160; Building a large product requires a system implementing 
              several steps.&#160; First, <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s must be reacted under positional 
              control by fabricators to form parts.&#160; Second, the parts must 
              be combined into nanosystems.&#160; Third, the nanosystems must 
              be combined into products, either by physical attachment or by distributed 
              control.&#160; Many authors have considered one or more of these 
              steps, but none has described a complete factory system. &#160; 
            </p>
<h3><font color="#000000">2.1.&#160; Mechanochemistry</font> </h3>
<p>As used in this paper, mechanochemistry refers to the process of 
              inducing <a class="thought" href="entries/covalent_bond_entry.html">covalent bond</a> formation or breaking under controlled conditions 
              by mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>.&#160; As discussed in (Drexler, 1992, chap. 
              8 &amp; 9), mechanochemistry performed in a well-controlled environment 
              appears sufficient to fabricate small devices from covalently bonded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> (diamondoid).&#160; Merkle (1997d, 1998) describes additional 
              reactions that could be used to build diamondoid products&amp;#8212a 
              complete hydrocarbon "metabolism" capable of refreshing 
              the molecular deposition tools, and Merkle and Freitas (2003) have 
              analyzed a specific diamond mechanosynthesis tool in detail.&#160; 
              The present design assumes that some such <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> is possible 
              in practice, and will have been characterized to some extent in 
              the process of building a working fabricator.&#160; Diamondoid fabrication 
              chemistry need not be completely understood&amp;#8212a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of 
              a few reliable deposition reactions, with motions parameterized 
              to account for edges and other discontinuities, should be sufficient 
              to build bulk diamond. </p>
<p>In order to focus on nanofactory architecture, the present work 
              does not consider mechanochemical operations in detail.&#160; Instead, 
              the design assumes the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of a small programmable mechanochemical 
              fabricator.&#160; To simplify architectural considerations, the 
              fabricator is assumed to be self-contained: it must be capable within 
              a small volume of performing all mechanical motions necessary to 
              fabricate parts from feedstock and assemble them into small devices 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> comparable to itself. &#160; </p>
<h3>2.2.&#160; Mechanochemical fabricator designs </h3>
<p>Several proposed devices appear to be capable of performing reliable 
              mechanochemical operations with sufficient flexibility for self-duplication.&#160; 
              These include the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> arm described by Drexler (1992, sec. 13.4), 
              the double tripod described by Merkle (1997c), the molecular mill 
              described by Drexler (1992, sec. 13.3), and the "parts <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>" 
              described by Hall (1999).&#160; Additionally, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> or hybrid 
              systems have been proposed (Bradbury, 2003) in which organic <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> 
              is used to build relatively large chemical components.&#160; Each 
              of these systems is attractive for various <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. </p>
<p>The robot arm requires several different mechanical components, 
              including small gears, triply-threaded toroidal worm drives, and 
              several types of cylindrical sliding <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s.&#160; Each of these 
              components may require significant <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-level design.&#160; In addition, 
              the robot arm requires a control system involving rotational motion 
              on several drive rods.&#160; Nanometer-scale clutches have not been 
              designed in detail.&#160; In order to provide results relevant to 
              early fabricator and nanofactory development, this paper does not 
              assume that devices of such complexity can be built.&#160;&#160; 
              Hall's parts synthesizer requires separate assembly robots to deliver 
              chemicals, and the power/control mechanism is not specified. </p>
<p>Systems relying on many biologically-based feedstock molecules 
              require separate synthesis and assembly areas, which may have quite 
              different environmental requirements.&#160; In addition, they may 
              require nontrivial transport mechanisms to prevent premature reaction 
              of the feedstock molecules.&#160; Finally, such systems do not appear 
              to permit the fabrication of diamondoid structures. </p>
<p>The molecular mill is an attractive <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> for several reasons.&#160; 
              It does not require explicit control of each mechanochemical operation, 
              thus greatly increasing efficiency over the other three proposals.&#160; 
              Operations can also be quite fast, since merely moving a belt a 
              short distance is sufficient to accomplish a mechanochemical operation.&#160; 
              However, each reactive encounter mechanism, or station, in a molecular 
              mill performs only one mechanochemical operation.&#160; Although 
              each station is efficient, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of processing a mass equal 
              to its own in a short time and with little <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> wasted, a large 
              number of stations would be required to fabricate all the parts 
              needed to build a nanofactory, let alone the desired range of products.&#160; 
              This number has not been quantified.&#160; Additional design would 
              be required to explain how a number of stations performing different 
              mechanochemical operations and using different parts can produce 
              all the required parts for <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> given that only one 
              chemical operation is performed at each station.&#160; Although 
              this does not contradict the possibility of a self-replicating set 
              of mills, it indicates that the set may be large and difficult to 
              design.&#160; In addition, the set may grow unpredictably when required 
              to produce additional parts for the non-fabricator portions of the 
              nanofactory, and may need significant modification if the design 
              of a part must be changed.&#160; Accordingly, a mill solution is 
              not used in this paper.&#160; However, it should be noted that a 
              combination of a mill making small blocks and a double tripod capable 
              of both joining blocks seamlessly (Drexler, 1992, sec. 9.7.3) and 
              performing detailed mechanochemistry may be fast, flexible, and 
              relatively easy to design, and would be preferable to the simple 
              robotic manipulator implicitly assumed for this baseline design. 
            </p>
<p>The current design effort is based loosely on a double-tripod "assembler" 
              discussed by Merkle (1999).&#160; Merkle's <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> is self-contained, 
              simple to control, and approximately the right size for a basic 
              factory or product building block.&#160; Every effort has been made 
              to avoid depending on any specific property of Merkle's design.&#160; 
              However, the claimed feasibility of this design serves as inspiration 
              for the present effort to integrate designs with comparable functionality 
              into a monolithic nanofactory. &#160; </p>
<h3>2.3.&#160; Parts assembly, scaling, and product integration </h3>
<p>Several nanotech manufacturing designs have been proposed that 
              could be used to build large products.&#160; For example, Bishop 
              (1996) describes an "Overtool" composed of multiple "active 
              cells" and "gantry cells" which can both do mechanochemistry 
              and encompass and manipulate a large product.&#160; This design 
              is incomplete, lacking description of control <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s and internal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s.&#160; Hall (1999) describes a system of robots and 
              framework components that can in theory scale to large size and 
              then make large products.&#160; However, feedstock delivery and 
              system control are not specified, and products it can fabricate 
              are not described.&#160; Drexler (1992, chap. 14) describes a system 
              in a fair amount of detail, including estimates of volume, mass, 
              and replication time.&#160; However, this description does not include 
              the assembly operations used, <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> required, or control of those 
              robotics.&#160; Additionally, the system uses molecular mills, which 
              have not been studied in detail, and the physical layout of the 
              system is specified only in general terms.&#160; This work, though 
              seminal and inspiring, does not permit detailed estimation of the 
              technological sophistication required to design such a system.&#160; 
              Merkle (1997a) described a variant of that system, including fabrication 
              time and the suggestion of assembling products from large sub-blocks.&#160; 
              However, he did not calculate the power requirements, describe the 
              internal control mechanisms, or discuss product design issues or 
              the feasibility of self-replication in any detail. </p>
<p>Large-scale cooperative designs are not well understood today, 
              and directing them may be expected to be difficult.&#160; Hall (1993) 
              describes a "utility fog" composed of many small identical 
              robots.&#160; Such a system would be relatively simple to manufacture, 
              requiring no large-scale assembly.&#160; Hall suggests that the 
              fog could use any of several fairly simple algorithms to simulate 
              solid <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s.&#160; However, he also does not consider how to power 
              the product/object, and the control algorithms are not worked out 
              in detail.&#160; Also, his fog is quite weak for its mass, at least 
              compared to a more strongly fastened diamondoid product. </p>
<p>The purpose of the nanofactory is to build strong, functionally 
              rich, monolithic, human-scale products that are easy to design and 
              use.&#160; Several innovations described in this paper allow a nanofactory 
              design to be presented in detail for the first time.&#160; The nanofactory 
              itself is intended to be in the set of possible products.&#160; 
              The paper focuses on early development and on demonstrably feasible 
              designs, so does not include some obvious but currently speculative 
              techniques for improving performance.&#160; The design is deliberately 
              simple, especially in minimizing the amount of mechanochemical design 
              needed in addition to the preexisting fabricator.&#160; The major 
              design effort focuses on mechanical and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> design, physical 
              layout, and fault tolerance. </p>
<p>Mechanical design <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology has achieved great competence in 
              the transformation of mechanical motion and force.&#160; Many devices 
              have been developed to accomplish this, such as cams and followers, 
              rack and pinion drives, <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary and differential gears, and pantographs.&#160; 
              Drexler (1992, chap. 10) demonstrated that many of these devices 
              can be translated directly to nanometer scale.&#160; However, many 
              of Drexler's designs use a specialized arrangement of surface atoms, 
              and sometimes of internal atoms.&#160; Such devices would require 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> chemical design.&#160; To avoid the unknown but potentially 
              large effort involved in developing new chemical synthesis for new 
              mechanical structures, the present design does not generally assume 
              the use of mechanical features smaller than ~1 nm.&#160; Such a 
              design is referred to as "bulk diamond", meaning that 
              simply specifying a suitable volumetric design to be filled with 
              diamond lattice is sufficient to specify a part with the required 
              mechanical function. </p>
<p>Although a wide range of sensing and feedback technologies have 
              been developed at the macro scale, some of them do not work at the 
              nanometer scale (e.g. optics and electromagnets; see Drexler, 1992, 
              sec. 2.4), and others may require excessive volume or complexity.&#160; 
              In general, this design effort avoids sensing in favor of predictability 
              and reliability.&#160; Digital <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> is useful for performing repetitive 
              functions, doing precise calculations, and selecting among alternatives 
              using well-specified criteria.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> systems that interact 
              with mechanical systems may be hampered by sensor <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that are 
              not well specified.&#160; Accordingly, this design does not make 
              much use of feedback, or require software to deal with "fuzzy" 
              situations.&#160; Almost all aspects of nanofactory operation are 
              deterministic; this mirrors the (theoretically) deterministic <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              of the mechanochemical technique (Drexler, 1992, sec. 6.3).&#160; 
              Because the factory layout is extremely repetitive and strictly 
              hierarchical, issues in controlling a large number of fabricators 
              and robots can be reduced to controlling a single fabricator or 
              robot, plus simple iteration. </p>
<p>As previously noted, this paper builds on work which demonstrates 
              that a nanofactory is conceptually feasible.&#160; The design presented 
              here is sufficiently detailed that the feasibility of each part 
              of it can be assessed.&#160; However, it is sufficiently general 
              that it can accommodate a variety of mechanochemical systems.&#160; 
              Where design principles are well understood, details are not supplied.&#160; 
              For example, the use of a gantry crane is specified in order to 
              demonstrate the existence of robotics capable of doing the job required, 
              and to allow approximate calculation of the mass of those components.&#160; 
              The drive mechanism of the gantry crane is not specified; however, 
              given a design tolerance of 1 nm and the presumed feasibility of 
              motors&#160; as small as 50 nm in diameter (see Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.2" target="_blank">8.2</a>), 
              it is clear that such a mechanism can be designed in a wide range 
              of sizes; at the present level of design, it is not necessary to 
              examine work on industrial robotics. </p>
<p>The extreme conservatism that is appropriate for a feasibility 
              demonstration is less appropriate for a preliminary engineering 
              study.&#160; For example, it is conservative to assume that each 
              individual part will require individual design at the atomic scale.&#160; 
              However, it is reasonable to assume that in the case of a rod with 
              bumps regularly spaced on it, the rod can be extended and bumps 
              can be added or removed without requiring detailed redesign.&#160; 
              Thus the use of mechanical digital logic designs (Drexler, 1992, 
              chap. 12) is assumed to require a mechanochemical design effort 
              for only a fixed and relatively small number of parts.&#160; Likewise, 
              the quantitative sections of this paper choose typical or reasonable 
              values instead of extreme or pessimistic values. &#160; </p>
<h3>2.4.&#160; Nanofactory overview </h3>
<p>The nanofactory system described here incorporates a large number 
              of fabricators under computer control.&#160; In a single <i>product 
              cycle</i>, each fabricator produces one <i>nanoblock</i>, approximately 
              the same size as the fabricator.&#160; The blocks are then joined 
              together, eight sub-blocks making one block twice as big.&#160; 
              This process is repeated until eight large blocks are produced, 
              and finally joined in an arrangement that is not necessarily cubical.&#160; 
              The output of multiple product cycles may be combined to produce 
              large products.&#160; The production system is arranged in a three-dimensional 
              hierarchical branching structure (see Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s4.3" target="_blank">4.3</a>) 
              which allows the sub-block assembly to be done by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of appropriate 
              size.&#160; Eight factories of a given size can be combined to form 
              one larger factory; the 64 blocks produced are joined into eight 
              blocks twice as big.&#160; The design is easily scalable to tabletop 
              size, with a ~1 meter factory producing eight ~5 cm blocks per product 
              cycle.&#160; As discussed in Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.4" target="_blank">8.4</a>, 
              depending on the capabilities of the mechanochemical fabricator, 
              the time required for a product cycle will be conveniently measured 
              in hours.&#160; The blocks need not be solid cubes, and their interior 
              may be quite complex.&#160; As discussed in Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s5.1.5" target="_blank">5.1.5</a>, 
              products can be unfolded after manufacture, greatly increasing the 
              range of possible product structures and allowing products to be 
              much larger than the nanofactory that produced them. </p>
<p>The exact size of the nanoblock is unimportant.&#160; For this 
              design, a 200-nm cube is convenient: it is large enough to contain 
              a simple 8086-equivalent <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a>, a microwatt worth of electrostatic 
              motors/generators, a shaft carrying 0.4 watts (Freitas, 1999, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/6.4.3.4.htm" target="_blank">sec. 
              6.4.3.4</a>), or the Merkle assembler (1999), but small enough to 
              be fabricated quickly and to survive background radiation for a 
              useful period of time.&#160; As discussed in Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s6" target="_blank">6</a>, 
              the partitioning of the product into nanoblocks, and the use of 
              relatively large sub-blocks at each step, allows the use of relatively 
              simple robotics and control algorithms in the nanofactory.&#160; 
              As discussed in Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s5" target="_blank">5</a>, 
              such division also simplifies product design without imposing many 
              practical limits on product complexity.&#160; (W. Ware points out 
              that a combination of tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra is also 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>-filling, and that this may be more compatible with the tetrahedral 
              diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>.) </p>
<p>At the smallest scale, the organization of the factory changes 
              to allow simpler distribution of feedstock, cooling, power, and 
              control, and simpler error handling.&#160; A <i>production module</i> 
              consists of one computer and a few thousand fabricators.&#160; It 
              produces a few blocks, a few microns in size, by combining a few 
              thousand nanoblocks.&#160; These rectilinear production modules 
              incorporate a few block assembly stages.&#160; They are combined 
              into the smallest factories, which are also rectilinear&amp;#8212and 
              so on to any size desired.&#160; At each stage, product blocks are 
              delivered through the center of the smallest face, allowing compact 
              stacking of multiple modules or stages.&#160; The stages are stacked 
              on either side of a gathering/assembly tube which contains simple 
              robotics to join the incoming product blocks into larger blocks 
              and deliver them out the end of the tube.&#160; Two stacks of stages, 
              plus the tube in between, constitute the next higher level stage. 
            </p>
<p>The nanofactory design is highly repetitive: each input (sub-factory, 
              or substage) to a stage is identical.&#160; Thus only one design 
              is required for each level, regardless of the number of substages 
              at that level.&#160; Since each stage joins eight blocks to form 
              one block with twice the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension, 19 sizes of stage (4 
              internal to the production module) are required to <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> from 
              a 200-nm nanoblock to a 10.5-cm product.&#160; (One additional stage, 
              a simplified gathering stage, is used to transition from production 
              modules to gathering/assembly stages.)&#160; Most of these stages 
              perform identical block-joining operations.&#160; The design of 
              one stage may be used with minor modification for several similar 
              stage sizes. </p>
<p>A nanofactory built with primitive fabricators and control systems 
              may use a lot of power.&#160; It will be cooled by a fluid with 
              suspended encapsulated ice <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s (Drexler, 1992, sec. 11.5).&#160; 
              Thus the temperature of the nanofactory will be a uniform 0 <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> (273 
              K).&#160; This is significant for the energy used by digital logic 
              (Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.2" target="_blank">8.2</a>) 
              and for aligning and joining large blocks (Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s3.2.1" target="_blank">3.2.1</a>). 
            </p>
<p>The control architecture of the nanofactory, like the physical 
              arrangement, is strictly hierarchical.&#160; Instructions can be 
              distributed from central computers directly to the computers that 
              directly control the fabricators.&#160; All error detection and 
              correction takes place either within a single nanocomputer or within 
              a production module controlled by a single nanocomputer, and error 
              reporting and compensation are not required beyond the production 
              module.&#160; There is no need for communication between any two 
              computers at the same level; a simple tree architecture can be used 
              to send all required data (Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.1" target="_blank">8.1</a>).&#160; 
              Exotic or complex control algorithms, <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ing architectures, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s are not required. </p>
<p>The size, mass, energy requirement, and duplication time of this 
              nanofactory design depend heavily on the properties of the fabricator.&#160; 
              Sections <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.2" target="_blank">8.2</a>, 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.3" target="_blank">8.3</a>,

              quantify these relations.&#160; With the assumptions made in those 
              sections, a tabletop nanofactory (1x1x1/2 meters) might weigh 10 
              kg or less, produce 4 kg of diamondoid (~10.5 cm cube) in 3 hours, 
              and require as little as fifteen hours to produce a duplicate nanofactory. 
              &#160; </p>
<h2>3.&#160;&#160; Components and Innovations </h2>
<p>To provide a workable design for a simple first-generation nanofactory 
              made from primitive fabricators, several innovations are described.&#160; 
              The linear ratchet drive proposed by Drexler (1992, sec. 16.3.2) 
              is extremely inefficient.&#160; Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s3.1" target="_blank">3.1</a> 
              describes a thermodynamically efficient stepping drive that is applicable 
              to all stepping actuators.&#160; The problem of how to join small 
              components into a large product has been greatly simplified by designing 
              a mechanical fastening system, described in Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s3.2.1" target="_blank">3.2.1</a>.&#160; 
              It has only two moving parts, requires no insertion force or actuation, 
              preserves much of the strength of the unbroken material, is easy 
              to grip and handle, and is tolerant of alignment errors.&#160; With

<p>The fabricator used in the nanofactory is unspecified; the nanofactory 
              design is sufficiently general that a wide variety of possible fabricator 
              designs can be incorporated.&#160; The reader may find it helpful 
              to study Merkle's "assembler" (1999) (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#sb" target="_blank">Appendix 
              B</a>) as a prototype.&#160; The only requirements are that the 
              fabricator must be capable of producing a variety of products of 
              size and complexity equal to itself from soluble feedstock molecules, 
              and that it use digital deterministic control, which implies that 
              the mechanochemical processes must be highly reliable.&#160; Since 
              only a few reactions will be sufficient to make a wide variety of 
              molecular shapes, and since error detection and correction will 
              be difficult if not impossible in early <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a>-architecture assemblers, 
              these requirements do not greatly reduce the generality of the present 
              design.&#160; (Unreliable operations can be retried multiple times 
              even in a deterministic system; see for example Drexler, 1992, sec. 
              13.3.1c). &#160; </p>
<h3>3.1.&#160; A Thermodynamically Efficient Stepping Drive </h3>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/PinDriveBig.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              1: Pin Drive</a> </p>
<p>A mechanical device driven by a sequence of simple digital commands 
              will have an internal state that changes with each command, and 
              must be maintained without error or slippage.&#160; Thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> 
              injects constant vibration into the system, requiring strong latching 
              mechanisms.&#160; A simple latching mechanism is a ratchet with 
              a strong spring, as proposed by Drexler and used by Merkle.&#160; 
              A stepping drive can be built from two ratchets, and early assembler 
              designs that are controlled by simple external signals may make 
              extensive use of such drives.&#160; Such a mechanism is extremely 
              inefficient, since the energy used to compress the spring (at least 
              100 kT [Boltzmann's constant times ambient temperature] to overpower 
              room-temperature thermal noise) is lost each time the ratchet moves 
              to the next tooth.&#160; However, when a fabricator is connected 
              to a digital logic system, the fabricator no longer needs internal 
              state-maintenance mechanisms, and the device can be made far more 
              efficient. (Digital logic, including gates and registers, can be 
              made thermodynamically efficient.) </p>
<p>An efficient drive with functional characteristics similar to the 
              ratchet drive is the pin drive.&#160; (See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/PinDriveBig.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              1</a>.)&#160; In this design, pins are inserted into equally spaced 
              holes (or notches) in the moving bar to assure its position at all 
              times.&#160; The latching pin moves in and out but not sideways, 
              and is used to hold the bar still.&#160; The driving pin moves in 
              and out, and also is moved sideways by a bar actuator over a distance 
              equal to the spacing of the holes.&#160; The pins are similar in 
              structure and function to the rods in Drexler's rod logic design.&#160; 
              To move the bar one step, the bar actuator is moved to one end of 
              its range, pulling the driving pin into alignment with a hole.&#160; 
              The driving pin is inserted.&#160; The latching pin is withdrawn.&#160; 
              Then the bar actuator is moved to the other end of its range, bringing 
              the next hole into alignment with the latching pin, which is then 
              inserted.&#160; Finally, the driving pin is withdrawn and then moved 
              back to its original position.&#160; Smaller step sizes may be obtained 
              by additional offset pins, or by a second vernier drive, similar 
              to the vernier ratchet drive described by Drexler (1992, sec. 16.3.2), 
              with slightly different hole spacing and bar actuator range of motion 
              from the main drive.&#160; Larger step sizes may be obtained by 
              moving the bar actuator a larger distance in each cycle. </p>
<p>Although the pin drive requires one more actuator than the ratchet 
              drive&#8212;two pins and a bar actuator, instead of two ratchet pawl 
              pullers&#8212;it has the advantage that it can move by measured steps 
              in either direction, whereas the two-ratchet drive can only move 
              stepwise in one direction and must retract in a single motion by 
              lifting both ratchets.&#160; (If both pins are lifted simultaneously, 
              the bar can be moved without restriction by a weak return actuator, 
              allowing the same rapid return motion as the ratchet drive.&#160; 
              Note that without careful design, verifying the complete return 
              of the bar will require energy on the order of 100 kT.)&#160; Similar 
              redesign can be applied to any stepping drive mechanism.&#160; As 
              long as the position of the moving member is initially known, it 
              can be moved stepwise, held stiffly against thermal noise at every 
              point, and locked in place in its new position, all without irreversible 
              state transitions. </p>
<p>While the pins are moving, the bar is stationary and the pins may 
              be moved reversibly.&#160; As the bar actuator is moved, the force 
              encountered may vary.&#160; Nevertheless, stiffly imposed motion 
              will be efficient in most cases.&#160; As long as the force profile 
              of the motion does not vary more rapidly per distance than the stiffness 
              of the drive mechanism, and does not vary substantially between 
              forward and backward motion (e.g. due to an irreversible state transition), 
              it does not <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how much force is required to move the bar at 
              each point because the energy will be recovered when the motion 
              is reversed.&#160; This energy recovery requirement implies that 
              the drive mechanism must be able to recover energy from being driven 
              by the bar; such designs are not difficult, and include Drexler's 
              electrostatic motor/generator (1992, sec. 11.7).&#160; The same 
              argument applies to other types of actuators driven by other digital 
              control mechanisms: as long as the force profile is reversible and 
              is less steep than the stiffness of the drive mechanism, the energy 
              that is put into the system is recoverable.&#160; Note that rapid 
              motion causes the force profile to deviate from reversibility due 
              to various energy dissipation mechanisms.&#160; (The author thanks 
              Eric Drexler for clarifying discussion of thermodynamic reversibility.)

<h3>3.2.&#160; Joining Product Blocks </h3>
<p>There are several possible ways to join two mechanochemically fabricated 
              objects.&#160; Van der Waals force is an attractive force that develops 
              between any two nearby objects.&#160; For a few unterminated surfaces, 
              covalent chemical bond formation can in theory be used to make a 
              seamless joint.&#160; A wide variety of mechanical joints can be 
              used.&#160; Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s3.2.1" target="_blank">3.2.1</a> 
              describes a particularly useful strong mechanical joint, and Section 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s3.2.2" target="_blank">3.2.2</a> 
              describes several press-fit joints for power, control, and fluid 
              connections between blocks. </p>
<p>At very small separations, two objects <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> an attractive 
              force called van der Waals force: simply bring them close together, 
              and they stick.&#160; For two flat diamond surfaces, the force is 
              approximately 1 nanonewton per square nanometer, or 10,000 atm of 
              pressure (Freitas, 1999, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/9.3.2.htm" target="_blank">sec. 
              9.3.2</a>).&#160; This is reasonably high, although it provides 
              only a fraction of the strength and stiffness of chemical bonds.&#160; 
              The van der Waals force is the simplest method of joining, it is 
              reversible, and it should provide sufficient strength to keep even 
              kg-scale products from falling apart under their own weight.&#160; 
              This type of joint is convenient and can be used for weak joining 
              of structures that must later be separated. </p>
<p>A diamond surface that is not passivated with an outer layer of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> will be very reactive.&#160; Unterminated diamondoid surfaces 
              forced together should form covalent bonds.&#160; According to Drexler, 
              two (110) surfaces of tetrahedral diamond or two (100) surfaces 
              of hexagonal diamond should bond to each other on contact, forming 
              a seamless joint (Drexler, 1992, secs. 8.6, 9.7.3, and 14.2.1).&#160; 
              Sinnott et al. (1997) report the results of simulations that show 
              bond formation, though not seamless joining.&#160; For other diamond 
              surfaces, or in the case of too-rapid joining, a somewhat weaker 
              joint may form with a lower bond density.&#160; Also, it is currently 
              unknown how much pressure would be required to initiate the process.&#160; 
              Crushing <a class="thought" href="entries/buckyball_entry.html">buckyball</a>s to diamond requires 20 GPa, but Drexler states 
              (personal communication, January 24, 2003) that a covalent joint 
              should "zipper" itself if started at an edge or corner, 
              that neon atoms should be able to escape the closing gap and would 
              not interfere with the joining, and that argon is even better in 
              this regard.&#160; If the joint were comparable in structure to 
              amorphous diamond currently made for <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a>, it would have a tensile 
              strength of only 8 GPa (Sullivan, 2002); this is significantly less 
              than diamond's tensile strength of 60 GPa (measured) to over 100 
              GPa (calculated, depending on crystal orientation) (Telling et al., 
              2000).&#160; An additional problem is that radiation damage or stray 
              molecules may cause local surface reconstruction or contamination 
              that may hold surfaces apart and prevent a joint from forming.&#160; 
              This type of joint is usually not reversible, though in theory a 
              carefully designed edge might allow predictable crack formation.&#160; 
              Since seamless covalent joints have not yet been demonstrated, the 
              present nanofactory design does not use this method. &#160; </p>
<h3>3.2.1.The Expanding Ridge Joint &#160;<a></a></h3>
<p> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/RidgeBig.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              2: Expanding Ridge Joint</a> </p>
<p>Each mating block face is covered with small "ridges" 
              that are roughly triangular in cross section.&#160; See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/RidgeBig.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              2</a>.&#160; All exposed surfaces are non-reactive (e.g. hydrogen-passivated 
              diamond).&#160; The ridges on each face interlock with the ridges 
              on the opposing face.&#160; As the joint is pressed together, the 
              ridges split and expand sideways.&#160; The exposed surfaces of 
              the ridges are not smooth, but are shaped to grip the opposing ridge, 
              with scallops deep enough to form overhangs when viewed perpendicular 
              to the block face.&#160; A scallop is chosen instead of a sawtooth 
              or ratchet profile in order to avoid crack formation at sharp concave 
              angles.&#160; Scallops also make assembly motions smoother, and 
              allow the un-powered assembly described below.&#160; The expansion 
              of the ridge opens a space in its center, which is then filled by 
              a shim which sits above the almost-closed gap between the two halves 
              of the ridge.&#160; Once the shim is in place, the volume of the 
              joint cannot easily be compressed, and the surfaces of the ridges 
              cannot easily slide past each other; pulling apart the joint would 
              require compressing a solid mass of diamond by several percent or 
              breaking at least half of the ridges simultaneously.&#160; If the 
              ridges all run in the same direction, the joint may be able to slide 
              freely.&#160; Crossed ridges will produce a joint that is quite 
              stiff against shear. </p>
<p>The triangular shape of the ridges has several advantages.&#160; 
              First, the area of the base of the triangles (almost the entire 
              area of the block surface) is structurally solid.&#160; (By contrast, 
              a square ridge would waste at least half of the structural strength 
              of the blocks being joined, because the block area adjacent to the 
              tops of the ridges would not contribute to the joint.)&#160; Second, 
              at small scales, van der Waals forces make handling of components 
              difficult because the components stick to any manipulator.&#160; 
              With triangular ridges and narrow ridge tops, the contact area of 
              the surface is much lower, reducing the van der Waals force.&#160; 
              Third, a manipulator can easily be aligned with the ridges.&#160; 
              Small blocks can be picked up by simple contact with a V-channeled 
              manipulator that presents sufficient surface area to form a van 
              der Waals bond of the desired strength, and the manipulator will 
              automatically be pulled into alignment.&#160; A more complex mating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> could fasten on several ridges at once.&#160; If the ridges 
              are placed at varying angles or spacings, a well designed manipulator/ridge 
              interface can guarantee that a misaligned manipulator cannot form 
              a firm grip.&#160; Likewise, a well designed ridge/ridge interface 
              can guarantee that misaligned blocks will not join incorrectly. 
            </p>
<p>There are at least three ways of mounting the ridge so that a small 
              attractive force between mating ridges will be sufficient to cause 
              the ridge to spread.&#160; The first possibility is to join the 
              ridge to the nanoblock with dovetail joints, permitting it to slide 
              sideways with very low friction.&#160; A simple dovetail joint costs 
              somewhat more than half of the possible joint strength; a stairstepped 
              dovetail joint (which is similar to a completed ridge joint) would 
              recover much of the strength at the cost of additional volume and 
              complexity.&#160; The second possibility is to use a mounting that 
              is strong in tension but flexible in shear, such as thin columns 
              of diamond or buckytubes.&#160; The third possibility, for use in 
              linear stacks of many nanoblocks, is to build a solid structure 
              extending from the base of the ridge all the way through the block 
              to the ridge on the opposing face.&#160; Both ridges would move 
              in tandem, and be locked in place when the shims were dropped on 
              each side.&#160; This might require a mechanism for retaining all 
              participating shims until all joints are pressed together. </p>
<p>The simplest version of the expanding ridge joint requires no actuation 
              to form the joint other than moving the faces together.&#160; As 
              the faces are brought together, just before the final closure, each 
              row of scallops brushes past the inverse row on the opposing ridge.&#160; 
              As the interlocking ridges from each surface interpenetrate, the 
              bulges of the scallops brush past each other, close enough to be 
              attracted by van der Waals force.&#160; This pulls the halves of 
              the ridge apart.&#160; The attraction between passing scallops when 
              the faces nearly touch must be stronger than the intra-ridge attraction, 
              to ensure ridge spreading during the last phase of joint insertion, 
              as the final rows of scallops pass each other.&#160; This is ensured 
              by the use of small spacers to control the van der Waals force holding 
              the intra-ridge gap closed.&#160; (The spreading will become increasingly 
              favorable as the faces approach, and the operation will happen slowly 
              enough to allow equilibration, so thermal noise will not cause the 
              joint to fail to close.)&#160; However, the intra-ridge attraction 
              (between halves of the same ridge) must be strong enough in the 
              initial position to prevent premature operation due to thermal noise.&#160; 
              The half-ridges must require a certain energy, say 100 kT, to pull 
              them apart far enough for the shim to be inserted; the displacement 
              which absorbs this energy cannot be greater than the depth of the 
              scallop.&#160; Note that the required energy is not dependent on 
              any spatial parameter; it is related only to temperature.&#160; 
              However, the attractive force is approximately proportional to surface 
              area, so this condition can be satisfied by a sufficiently long 
              ridge joint.&#160; In other words, regardless of the actual inter-scallop 
              force, an intra-ridge gap can be chosen that will allow the ridge 
              halves to be separated; and regardless of the gap, a sufficiently 
              long ridge will be resistant to premature separation. </p>
<p>Due to the complicated <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> of the scallops, exact calculation 
              of the attractive force between mating ridge halves is beyond the 
              scope of this paper.&#160; An inaccurate calculation is given to 
              permit crude estimation of minimum ridge length.&#160; The formula 
              for attraction between cylinders (Drexler, 1992, Fig. 3.10f) will 
              be applied, treating each scallop as a 0.5-nm radius cylinder separated 
              by 0.3 nm.&#160; (This is inaccurate because it ignores the attractive 
              contribution from the material behind the cylinders, and because 
              the formula's derivation assumes that cylinder radius is much greater 
              than cylinder separation.)&#160; The inter-scallop potential energy 
              is calculated as 61 zJ per linear nanometer of scallop contact, 
              which corresponds to 2 nm^2 of surface between the two halves of 
              the ridge.&#160; To reduce the intra-ridge potential energy to 50 
              zJ per scallop-nm or 25 zJ per nm^2, the spacing must be at least 
              0.6 nm (ignoring the attractive contribution from the spacer) according 
              to the formula in (Drexler, 1992, Fig. 3.10d) which slightly overestimates 
              the attractive force since the ridge is not infinitely thick. </p>
<p>When the gap between the half-ridges is fully open, the shim (which 
              includes a hollow to accommodate the spacer) is pulled into the 
              gap and held there reliably by van der Waals force.&#160; The shim 
              will insert when the ridges have moved apart by a distance equal 
              to the depth of the scallop undercut, in this example 1 nm.&#160; 
              With a 1-nm deep scallop and a 0.6 nm initial gap (thus a 1.6-nm 
              wide shim), the difference in potential energy between 0.6 nm and 
              1.6 nm spacing is 21.5 zJ/nm^2.&#160; To prevent premature insertion, 
              the intra-ridge potential energy of attraction must differ by 100 
              kT (260 zJ at 0 C) between closed and open positions.&#160; This 
              requires 12 nm^2 of intra-ridge gap.&#160; If the ridge is 8 nm 
              high (with 4 scallops), then it need only be 1.5 nm long. </p>
<p>The joint may be stiffened by compressing the joint volume.&#160; 
              In this case, extra force may be used to insert the shim into the 
              gap.&#160; (This also allows the gap to be somewhat narrower, reducing 
              non-structural volume.)&#160; A simple design for an electrostatic 
              actuator adds only one moving part.&#160; The shim is blanketed 
              between insulated capacitor plates, one of which is flexible.&#160; 
              Charging the capacitor makes the plates pull together, expelling 
              the shim like a watermelon seed.&#160; The electricity to power 
              the actuator can be delivered through contact with small embedded 
              conductors at the proper time during the convergent assembly process.&#160; 
              The tip of the shim can be tapered to help spread the ridge halves.&#160; 
              Once the shim is expelled, the capacitor plates will adhere to each 
              other by van der Waals force, forming a reliable barrier to hold 
              the shim in the joint even if the capacitor is discharged. </p>
<p>Tension on the joint will tend to expand the entire joint volume 
              sideways.&#160; This can be constrained by surrounding each joint 
              (not each ridge) with a diamond collar sufficient to resist the 
              sideways force generated by a single ridge.&#160; The ridge joint 
              is somewhat less stiff in tension or compression than solid diamond 
              would be, but should be almost as strong: failure requires either 
              significant compression of a large volume of diamond, or the simultaneous 
              failure of many covalent bonds.&#160; Effectively, the entire joint 
              volume except for the depth of the scallops and the width of the 
              shim contributes to the tensile strength, and the entire joint volume 
              except for the shim contributes to the compressive strength.&#160; 
              Shear strength and stiffness depend on the orientation and attachment 
              of the ridges, but can be made quite high perpendicular to the ridge 
              line.&#160; Torsional and bending strength and stiffness can also 
              be made quite high. </p>
<p>The width of the shim is unrelated to the size of the ridge, being 
              equal to the depth of the scallop's undercut plus the intra-ridge 
              van der Waals gap.&#160; A reasonable lower bound for component 
              size is a ridge composed of four scallops 1 nm deep and offset by 
              &#189; nm horizontally and 2 nm vertically.&#160; The height of the ridge 
              is 8 nm, and the footprint of a half-ridge is 3.5 nm (accommodating 
              0.5 nm of motion to mate with the opposing half-ridge), of which 
              2 nm contributes structural strength.&#160; The 1.6-nm wide shim 
              adds an additional 0.8 nm of non-structural overhead to each half-ridge; 
              the total joint tensile strength is approximately 47% of solid diamond.&#160; 
              (Shallower scallops will improve this number up to a point; scallops 
              that are too shallow can fail by slipping past each other.)&#160; 
              For reliable operation the ridge must be at least 1.5 nm long.&#160; 
              The smallest joint consists of one half-ridge on each side, only 
              one of which (and its shim) needs to move; the rest of the joint 
              including the mating half-ridge can be solid diamond.&#160; A single 
              joint can potentially have a footprint smaller than 3x6 nm.&#160; 
              Larger ridges can have more scallops, with the size of each scallop 
              (and thus of the shim) staying constant.&#160; For example, a half-ridge 
              20 nm high with 10 scallops has a footprint of 6.5 nm (plus 0.8 
              nm for its share of the shim) of which 5 nm is structural, for 68% 
              of diamond strength.&#160; Covering a 200-nm block with 8-nm-high 
              ridges on each side requires 8% of the block volume (ignoring block 
              edges and corners).&#160; However, in a high-strength application 
              that requires ridge joint coverage of the full surface, the block 
              must be nearly solid diamond anyway. </p>
<p>Because the strength of the joint decreases only slightly with 
              smaller size (the decrease is a function of the minimum shim, scallop, 
              and van der Waals gap size), small ridges are mechanically adequate 
              for joining blocks at any scale.&#160; Minimum ridge size is determined 
              by the mechanochemical fabrication process.&#160; The only limitations 
              on block size are the precision of the block-handling machinery 
              and the possibility of unequal expansion of the faces due to temperature 
              differences.&#160; With 200 nm nanoblocks, ridges built in a single 
              block can be up to 100 nm in height, with tops 50 nm apart.&#160; 
              (Note that the blocks will overlap by the height of the ridge.&#160; 
              The change in effective block width during assembly presents issues 
              for the assembly process that are straightforward but beyond the 
              scope of this paper.)&#160; An assembly tolerance of 0.05 micron 
              is somewhat beyond today's standards; current state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> for 
              automated pick and place assembly for optical components appears 
              to be around 0.5 micron (Blaze Network Products, 2003).&#160; However, 
              today's pick and place systems use <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> made with a manufacturing 
              tolerance comparable to its performance.&#160; In contrast, the 
              dimensional precision of the nanofactory's hardware will be approximately 
              one atomic diameter or less, regardless of scale.&#160; At large 
              scales, single ridges can be assembled from multiple nanoblocks, 
              allowing ridge spacing of multiple microns; this is sufficient even 
              for today's robotics. </p>
<p>Differences in fabrication processes, assembly processes, and internal 
              structure may cause different blocks to be at different temperatures.&#160; 
              The resulting thermal expansion can cause a misalignment of the 
              ridges.&#160; The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of diamond 
              is 3.5x10^-6/K (Freitas, 1999, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/AppendixA.htm" target="_blank">Appendix 
              A</a>); the linear coefficient is one-third that, or 1.2x10^-6/K.&#160; 
              A temperature difference of 1 K thus causes a 200 nm block to expand 
              by a small fraction of an <a class="thought" href="entries/angstrom_entry.html">angstrom</a>, while a 10.5-cm surface will 
              expand by 126 nm.&#160; Because diamond is an excellent conductor 
              of heat, passive equilibration may be sufficient.&#160; As long 
              as the displacement is not greater than the ridge spacing, or the 
              ridge pattern does not permit improper joining, the blocks may be 
              pressed together slowly, allowing the temperature to equalize.&#160; 
              Even a rarefied internal atmosphere will also facilitate temperature 
              equalization between nearby faces, though this process may be slow 
              depending on block mass, and the process will be somewhat slower 
              with argon than with neon.&#160; Note that the nanofactory is cooled 
              by phase transition (see Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.2" target="_blank">8.2</a>), 
              so the cooling fluid will have the same temperature throughout the 
              factory, minimizing potential product temperature differences.&#160; 
              Active compensation might involve sensing the temperature at various 
              points on the surfaces and applying heat to the cooler surface via 
              embedded resistive heaters; this will only be necessary for the 
              few large-scale joints that take place near the end of the assembly 
              process, and the heating process can be initiated in advance to 
              avoid delay.&#160; Embedded mechanical (bi-material) thermostats 
              can allow each region to reach a preset temperature without individual 
              attention. </p>
<p>Because the joints require no external manipulation or assembly 
              force, they can be used to fasten non-bonded parts that are only 
              loosely connected to the main nanoblock.&#160; For example, a structural 
              beam one micron long and 50 nm wide can be constructed in five sections.&#160; 
              Each section will be terminated in ridge joints, and laid across 
              a nanoblock in a position that will place the section ends next 
              to each other during block assembly; van der Waals force will hold 
              the section in place during block manipulation.&#160; When the nanoblocks 
              are assembled, the ridge joints of the beam will join at the same 
              time as the rest of the joints, with no additional effort.&#160; 
              This allows the inclusion of long, thin components in product designs.&#160; 
              Likewise, single nanoblocks can be made in separate pieces joined 
              by van der Waals force.&#160; This allows a block to be pulled apart 
              during the unfolding process, forming multiple walls with large 
              spaces between them.&#160; This can be useful to save mass where 
              only thin walls are needed.&#160; If a block is split into as many 
              as 10 walls or 100 columns, the 20-nm width is sufficient for multiple 
              full-sized ridge joints on each part.&#160; This capability is assumed 
              for interior nanofactory structure. </p>
<p>Joints can be formed after the product is released from the factory, 
              as long as contaminants have been excluded from the joint space.&#160; 
              The factory can manufacture a larger containing balloon for product 
              unfolding, or the joints can be protected individually by a variety 
              of covering mechanisms.&#160; A product can be created in a very 
              compact form, then unfold like a pop-up book or like flat-packed 
              cardboard boxes.&#160; Components can be built in pieces, with lightweight 
              pantographic trusswork to bring the ends together as the product 
              expands; once the ends touch, the strong joint will form. A component 
              can also be made in a "broken" state, with mating surfaces 
              held together on one edge with a small hinge at any desired angle, 
              and the open end protected by a bellows if necessary.&#160; When 
              the component is straightened, the mating surfaces will form the 
              desired strong connection.&#160; A weak and reversible joint can 
              be formed by preventing the shims from entering the gaps between 
              the ridges.&#160; This allows blocks to be loosely connected, then 
              disconnected, and finally reconnected tightly in the same or different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>.&#160; This may be useful if the unfolding process 
              requires a structure to be produced in its final conformation, then 
              flexed, and finally fastened rigidly. &#160; </p>
<h3>3.2.2.Functional joints </h3>
<p>A product may contain embedded wires, pipes, rotating rods, nanocomputer 
              logic rods, and polyyne control cables.&#160; All of these may need 
              to make a connection between adjacent nanoblocks.&#160; These connections 
              are generally simple, and cost less than 50% of the performance 
              that would be possible with a seamless design. </p>
<p>Embedded wires can be run up to a flat face, and electrical contact 
              made by <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a>.&#160; Contact can be maintained in the case of 
              joint strain by the use of springy interfaces.&#160; According to 
              measured values for a sample of HOPG (highly ordered pyrolitic graphite), 
              (GE Advanced Ceramics, 2002) graphite is about 5000 times more conductive 
              in-plane than cross-plane (and the in-plane value is 1/50 as good 
              as a typical metal).&#160; The separation of graphite planes is 
              0.335 nm, about 1/600 of the 200-nm nanoblock width.&#160; This 
              implies that a graphite-graphite tunneling surface of 8 nm^2 per 
              nm^2 of graphite wire, spaced every 200 nm, would only double the 
              total resistance.&#160; To save nanoblock surface area, the tunneling 
              surface can consist of interlocking corrugations.&#160; Because 
              diamond is an excellent insulator, high voltages may be used to 
              compensate for the resistance of graphite.&#160; Some buckytubes 
              may be better conductors. </p>
<p>Control cables and control rods will be built into each nanoblock 
              when it is manufactured, and extend only to its edges.&#160; Tension 
              and/or compression must be transferred between blocks.&#160; Nanocomputer 
              logic rods have ends ~1 nm^2 which can be butted together.&#160; 
              The nanocomputer design uses tensional force of 2 nN (Drexler, 1992, 
              sec. 12.3.3.b) but this can be traded for displacement or compressive 
              force without sacrificing reliability.&#160; Alternatively, the 
              joint area can be increased by a few nm^2 to allow a few nN of tensile 
              force to be transmitted through van der Waals attraction.&#160; 
              Crossing between blocks may require adding extra <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>s to 
              transform and condition the signal; this logic can all be reversible 
              at some cost of time.&#160; Such interfaces will not add significantly 
              to the power requirements or design complexity of a nanocomputer. 
            </p>
<p>Polyyne (carbon chains with alternating single and triple bonds) 
              control cables can be terminated with a small diamondoid plate flush 
              with the nanoblock surface.&#160; When the blocks are joined, the 
              plates will stick by van der Waals force.&#160; Each two atoms of 
              polyyne spans a length of 0.2569 nm and has a compliance of 0.00185 
              m/N (Casing an Assembler, "Control cables").&#160; A 1-nm 
              diamond cube contains 176 carbon atoms.&#160; A van der Waals interface 
              has a stiffness of &gt;30 N/m per nm^2 (Drexler, 1992, sec. 9.7.1), 
              or a compliance of &lt;0.0334 m/N.&#160; Two hundred nm of polyyne 
              contains 1557 carbon atoms and has a compliance of 1.44 m/N, while 
              198 nm of polyyne interrupted by two 1-nm diamond cubes interfaced 
              by van der Waals force contains 1893 carbon atoms and has a compliance 
              of 1.47 m/N; the interface increases cable mass by 22% and compliance 
              by 2% (ignoring the hydrogen termination and internal compliance 
              of the diamond cubes) and may introduce resonances into extremely 
              high-speed operations.&#160; The main drawback of the interface 
              is its strength; the tensile strength of a polyyne rod is &gt;6 
              nN, but the strength of the interface is ~1 nN.&#160; Increasing 
              the interface area allows a stronger and stiffer joint, and for 
              joint areas above a few square nanometers a ridge joint can be used 
              at some cost of mass. </p>
<p>Power can be transmitted by means of thin rotating rods, embedded 
              in the nanoblocks like the control cables and logic rods.&#160; 
              Mating convolutions on rod ends will allow the transmission of torque 
              between ends that are simply pressed together.&#160; If the rod 
              is driven near maximum torque, the interface may need to be somewhat 
              larger than the cross section of the rod.&#160; The bursting speed 
              of a disc decreases in proportion with its radius, while the area 
              increases as the square of the radius; thus a 2x increase in interface 
              area will cause a 1.4x <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in speed.&#160; In this simple 
              example, power transmission is derated by 40%; however, other mechanical 
              linkages such as a thin belt connecting offset and overlapping rods 
              may permit full speed while delivering full torque.&#160; (The belt 
              can be placed around one rod during nanoblock manufacture and held 
              open by any of a variety of methods.&#160; The other rod can be 
              tapered to slip inside the belt during block assembly.&#160; Interlocking 
              (gear-toothed) rod surfaces will also work but may require significant 
              overlap for reliable torque transmission.)&#160; Rods and shafts 
              larger than a few nm can be joined by ridge joints.&#160; Ridge 
              joints may also serve as a means of chocking the shafts to ensure 
              proper alignment, and then unlocking them during convergent assembly: 
              the shims can be inserted only when the joint is fully closed, and 
              the motion of their insertion can be used to remove a mechanical 
              chock.&#160; Small rods can be controlled by adjacent ridge joints, 
              and large shafts by facial joints with internal shims. </p>
<p>Bearing surfaces for rotating shafts small enough to be embedded 
              in nanoblocks can be built into each nanoblock during construction.&#160; 
              Variations in rod diameter will prevent the rods slipping out of 
              the block prior to convergent assembly.&#160; Large rods pose a 
              special problem for convergent assembly, since they cannot be strongly 
              and permanently fastened to a support or bearing structure.&#160; 
              However, for products up to 10 cm size, a tight-fitting bearing 
              surface between a rod and a housing can provide the necessary adhesion 
              by van der Waals force alone.&#160; Rotational <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> can be constrained 
              by small retractable chocks.&#160; Graphite pads covering the matching 
              surfaces of the blocks constituting the shaft and the blocks constituting 
              the housing can provide a bearing surface even for slightly rough 
              curved surfaces.&#160; However, the boundaries between the pads 
              will be aligned on the moving and bearing surface, and this can 
              create a significant force.&#160; (Twisting one of the surfaces 
              relative to the other would break the alignment, but this will not 
              be possible for cylindrical bearings.)&#160; Order-of-magnitude 
              calculations can be made by treating the boundary gaps as regions 
              of wider spacing between the surfaces, calculating the difference 
              in van der Waals energy between aligned and unaligned regions, and 
              dividing that by the width of the gap to find a force.&#160; Approximating 
              the boundary as a trench 1 nm wide and 0.1 nm deep and the pad spacing 
              as 0.2 nm, and applying the formula from (Drexler, 1992, Fig. 3.10d), 
              indicates an energy difference of 81 zJ per nm^2 in favor of the 
              aligned state, or an average force of 81 pN per linear nm of trench.&#160; 
              One mm^2 of flat sliding surface will contain 5x10^9 nm of trench 
              crossing the direction of motion, creating a force of ~0.4 N.&#160; 
              However, the stiffness of 1 mm^2 of graphite bearing surface is 
              ~3x10^13 N/m, so for many macroscopic applications, bearings may 
              be made small enough that the "roughness" is not a significant 
              problem.&#160; A cylindrical bearing surface cuts across two nanoblock 
              planes and only a fraction of the area contributes to stiffness; 
              these factors increase the number of trenches (and thus the "roughness" 
              force) for a given bearing stiffness by approximately a factor of 
              4. </p>
<p>Pipes are simply voids in the diamond nanoblocks that are butted 
              together when the blocks are assembled.&#160; A flat, uncompressed 
              interface between <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>-terminated diamond (111) surfaces is 
              adequate to exclude helium (Drexler, 1992, sec. 11.4.2a).&#160; 
              If this type of interface proves inadequate in practice (perhaps 
              due to joint flexure, or unavailability of nitrogen termination 
              chemistry), a conical extension of the pipe wall wrapped in one 
              or more layers of graphite to provide a compressive seal and extending 
              into a conical depression in the other block should suffice.&#160; 
              Pipes too large to be contained inside a nanoblock can be sealed 
              by diamond or graphite curtain walls, placed along each seam, to 
              separate the interior of the pipe from the mechanical joint area.&#160; 
              If the nanofactory is filled with inert gas, pipes will also be 
              filled with the gas when they are manufactured.&#160; If this is 
              a problem, one possible solution is to place a collapsed graphite 
              tube inside the pipe, terminating the tube ends at the nanoblock 
              faces with a diamond mating collar thin enough to be flexible.&#160; 
              When the blocks are assembled, the collars join.&#160; When first 
              used, the graphite tube will expand and conform to the walls of 
              the pipe while displaced gas can be vented through small channels.

<h2>4.&#160;&#160; Nanofactory Architecture </h2>
<p>A nanofactory, as conceived here, is a single device containing 
              many mechanochemical fabricators and larger-scale manipulator systems.&#160; 
              The mechanochemical fabricators produce nanoblocks and the manipulator 
              systems join them into a product.&#160; The mechanochemical working 
              space of a nanofactory must contain no stray reactive molecules.&#160; 
              The factory must contain computers to control the machinery; space 
              and mechanisms for convergent assembly; structures for distributing 
              power, chemicals, and cooling fluid; mechanochemical fabricators 
              with space for them to work; and additional space for joining blocks 
              into larger blocks and transporting them through the factory. </p>
<p>The nanofactory is built hierarchically, using only a few scalable 
              designs.&#160; At the lowest level, a few thousand fabricators are 
              arranged in a planar grid.&#160; Their products are picked up and 
              assembled into increasingly large blocks by a series of increasingly 
              large robotic manipulators.&#160; This plus a control computer constitutes 
              a basic, reliable <i>production module</i>.&#160; The production 
              modules are stacked three-dimensionally into <i>gathering stages</i>, 
              which assemble blocks and pass them to higher-level gathering stages.&#160; 
              Finally, the entire factory is enclosed in a suitable casing, with 
              a mechanism to output product without contaminating the workspace. 
            </p>
<p>In Merkle's convergent assembly architecture (1999) it is suggested 
              that each convergent assembly stage has four inputs, each supplying 
              two blocks to make one output block.&#160; However, this means that 
              each input to the preceding stage must supply four blocks to make 
              those two, and so on.&#160; This is feasible if blocks can be manufactured 
              extremely quickly, or (as in Merkle's design) fed through a relatively 
              small number of ports efficiently.&#160; The current design, using 
              large nanoblocks requiring minutes or hours to fabricate, uses only 
              one block from each fabricator per product cycle.&#160; This implies 
              that each stage will receive all its blocks in parallel.&#160; In 
              general, then, each stage must have either eight (non-redundant) 
              or nine or ten (redundant) inputs.&#160; (The first gathering stage 
              has only four inputs, to compensate for the eighteen inputs of the 
              final stage in the production module; see below.) </p>
<h3>4.1.&#160; Mechanochemical functionality </h3>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/GridsBig.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              3: Workstation Grids</a> </p>
<p>Once a self-contained, digitally controlled mechanochemical fabrication 
              system has been developed, the fabricator design can be copied directly 
              from it.&#160; Early systems will presumably use a simple, stiff 
              robot, such as a double tripod (Merkle, 1997c) or Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>.&#160; 
              As noted in Section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s8.2" target="_blank">8.2</a>, 
              any inefficient ratchet or other state-keeping systems in the fabricator 
              can be replaced with thermodynamically efficient stepping drives.&#160; 
              Even with this improvement, the primitive method of mechanochemistry 
              will cost some efficiency relative to the "mill" type 
              designs analyzed by Drexler (1992, sec. 13.3) and used in his nanofactory 
              design (1992, sec. 14.4).&#160; Because placing each atom or molecule 
              requires a large and complicated motion of the tripod system, the 
              nanofactory will suffer some penalty in both speed and energy use; 
              these penalties are substantial but not crippling.&#160; Mills are 
              not included in this preliminary design because they may require 
              significant additional mechanical and mechanochemical design. </p>
<p>Fabricators will be fastened together edgewise to form the planar 
              array, which divides the coolant volume from the working volume.&#160; 
              Cooling fluid with dissolved feedstock circulates past one side; 
              the products (nanoblocks) are fabricated and released on the opposite 
              side, which is open to the nanofactory's clean working volume.&#160; 
              A square of nine fabricators (one redundant) forms a stage.&#160; 
              Product blocks are picked up by a three degree of freedom gantry 
              crane manipulator and assembled into a 0.4-micron block.&#160; Likewise, 
              a square of nine of these stages forms the next stage.&#160; This 
              continues through several levels; in the current design, four levels 
              is chosen for suitable redundancy and convenient control. &#160; 
            </p>
<h3>4.2.&#160; The reliable basic production module </h3>
<p> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/ProdModBig.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 
              4: Production Module</a> </p>
<p>A production module fabricates two 3.2 micron product blocks out 
              of up to 8,192 nanoblocks, using a fabricator to produce each nanoblock.&#160; 
              The module is extremely reliable in the face of radiation damage, 
              and is controlled by an integrated nanocomputer.&#160; The overall 
              shape of the module is a rectangular solid ~16x16x12 microns.&#160; 
              The fabricators are placed on two opposite sides, delivering their 
              product nanoblocks to the interior.&#160; The nanocomputer occupies 
              a third side, surrounding the product exit <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a>.&#160; The remaining 
              three sides may be closed by thin walls, but need not be closed 
              at all where two production modules are placed side by side in the 
              nanofactory.&#160; The interior is sparsely filled with gantry crane 
              manipulators to assemble the nanoblocks into larger blocks.&#160; 
              The gantry crane mechanisms, even at the smallest scale, can be 
              implemented as bulk diamond machines&#8212;the smallest blocks are 
              200 nm on a side, and bulk diamond parts can be designed far smaller 
              than that, so not much material or volume will be wasted due to 
              inefficient design <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s.&#160; With the ridge joints, the 
              blocks can be assembled simply by bringing them into contact (Section 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925101456/http://www.jetpress.org/volume13/Nanofactory.htm#s3.2.1" target="_blank">3.2.1)</a>.
