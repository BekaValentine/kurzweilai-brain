<h2><b>Abstract</b></h2>
<p>Many words have been written about the dangers of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. 
              Most of the threatening scenarios involve tiny manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              that run amok, or are used to create destructive products. A manufacturing 
              infrastructure built around a centrally controlled, relatively large, 
              self-contained manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> would avoid these problems. 
              A controlled nanofactory would pose no inherent danger, so it could 
              be deployed and used widely. Cheap, clean, convenient, on-site manufacturing 
              would be possible without the risks associated with uncontrolled 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> fabrication or excessive regulation. Control of the products 
              could be administered by a central authority; <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> 
              rights could be respected. In addition, restricted-design <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              could allow unrestricted innovation while limiting the capabilities 
              of the final products. The proposed solution appears to preserve 
              the benefits of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> while minimizing the most 
              serious risks.</p>
<h2><b>Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> And Its Risks</b></h2>
<p>As early as 1959, <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> proposed building <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with 
              each precisely placed <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In 1986, Eric Drexler published an influential 
              book, <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, in which he described some of the benefits and 
              risks of such a capability. If <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s can be manufactured 
              by joining <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> atoms under <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> control, it will be possible 
              to build <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s out of diamond, 100 times as strong as steel; 
              to build <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s smaller than a bacterium; and to build <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">*</a> and mini-factories of various sizes, capable of making complex 
              products and even of duplicating themselves.</p>
<p>Drexler's subsequent book, Nanosystems<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, 
              substantiated these remarkable claims and added still more. A self-contained 
              tabletop factory could produce its duplicate in one hour. <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a>s 
              with moving parts could be incredibly efficient. Molecular manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s could be carried out with failure rates less than one 
              in a quadrillion. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would require a miniscule fraction 
              of a watt and one trillion of them could fit into a cubic centimeter. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a>-built <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> plumbing would be able to cool the resulting 
              10,000 watts of waste heat. It seems clear that if advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              is ever developed, its products will be incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>As soon as molecular manufacturing was proposed, risks associated 
              with it began to be identified. <a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a><sup>2</sup> 
              describes one of the most famous: gray goo. A small <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> capable 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> could in theory replicate itself too many times<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. If it were capable of surviving outdoors and 
              of using biomass as raw material, it could eventually devour the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biosphere_entry.html">biosphere</a><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Others have analyzed the likelihood of an unstable 
              arms race<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and many have suggested economic upheaval resulting 
              from the widespread use of free manufacturing<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a>. Some have even suggested that the entire basis of the 
              economy would change, and money would become obsolete<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Sufficiently powerful products would allow malevolent people, either 
              hostile <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s or angry <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, to wreak havoc. Destructive 
              nanomachines could do immense damage to unprotected people and <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. 
              If the wrong people gained the ability to manufacture any desired 
              product, they could rule the world, or cause massive destruction 
              in the attempt<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Certain products, such as vast surveillance 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, powerful aerospace <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, and microscopic antipersonnel 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, provide special cause for concern. Gray goo is relevant 
              here as well: an effective means of sabotage would be to release 
              a hard-to-detect <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that continued to manufacture copies of itself 
              by destroying its surroundings.</p>
<p>Clearly, the unrestricted availability of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              poses grave risks that may well outweigh the benefits of clean, 
              cheap, convenient, self-contained manufacturing. As analyzed in 
              Forward to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> and Regulatory Policy<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, 
              some restriction is likely to be necessary. However, as was also 
              pointed out in that study, an excess of restriction will enable 
              the same problems by increasing the incentive for covert development 
              of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. That paper considered regulation on 
              a one-dimensional spectrum, from full <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> to complete 
              lack of restriction. As will be shown below, a two-dimensional understanding 
              of the problem&#8212;taking into account both control of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing 
              capability and control of its products&#8212;allows targeted restrictions 
              to be applied, minimizing the most serious risks while preserving 
              the potential benefits. </p>
<h2><b><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> Manufacturing and Its Products</b></h2>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> at the heart of this dilemma is molecular manufacturing. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> capable of molecular manufacturing&#8212;whether nanoscale or 
              macroscale&#8212;has two possible functions: to create more manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> by replicating itself and to manufacture products. Most 
              products created by molecular manufacturing will not possess any 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, or indeed for manufacturing of any 
              kind; as a result, each product can be evaluated on its own merits, 
              without worrying about special <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> risks. A <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>-based 
              manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, on the other hand, could build <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, gray 
              goo, or anything else it was <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to produce. The solution 
              then is to regulate nanofactories; products are far less dangerous. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>-built car could no more turn into gray goo than a steel-and-plastic 
              car could. </p>
<p>Some products, however, will be powerful enough to require restriction. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s would be far more effective than today's versions. 
              Very small products could get lost and cause nano-litter, or be 
              used to spy undetectably on people. And a product that included 
              a general molecular manufacturing capability would be, effectively, 
              an unregulated nanofactory&#8212;horrifyingly dangerous in the wrong hands. 
              Any widespread use of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing must include the ability 
              to restrict, somehow, the range of products that can be produced. 
            </p>
<p>If it can be done safely, widespread use of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing 
              looks like a very good idea for the following <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s: </p>
<p>&#183;&#160; The ability to produce duplicate manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              means that manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> could be doubled almost for free. 
            </p>
<p>&#183;&#160; A single, self-contained, clean-running nanofactory could 
              produce a vast range of strong, efficient, <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based products 
              as they are needed. </p>
<p>&#183;&#160; Emergency and humanitarian aid could be supplied quickly 
              and cheaply. </p>
<p>&#183;&#160; Many of the environmental pressures caused by our current 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> base could be mitigated or removed entirely. </p>
<p>&#183;&#160; The rapid and flexible manufacturing cycle will allow many 
              innovations to be developed rapidly. </p>
<p>Although a complete survey and explanation of the potential benefits 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is beyond the scope of this paper, it seems clear 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> has a lot to offer. </p>
<p>All of these advantages should be delivered as far as is consistent 
              with minimizing risks. Humanitarian imperatives and opportunities 
              for profit both demand extensive use of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. In addition, 
              failure to use <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will create a pent-up demand for its 
              advantages, which will virtually guarantee an uncontrollable black 
              market. Once <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> has been developed, a second, independent 
              development project would be both far easier and far more dangerous 
              than the original project. The first nanofactory must be made available 
              for widespread use to reduce the impetus for independent development<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Development of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> must be undertaken with care to avoid 
              accidents; once a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>-based manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is created, 
              it must be administered with even more care. Irresponsible use of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> could lead to black markets, unstable arms races ending 
              in immense destruction, and possibly a release of gray goo. Deliberate 
              misuse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> by inhumane <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, terrorists, criminals, 
              and irresponsible teenagers could produce even worse problems&#8212;gray 
              goo is a feeble <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a> compared to what could be designed. It seems 
              likely that <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> leading to advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will have 
              to be carefully monitored and controlled. </p>
<p>However, the same is not true of product <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development.The 
              developer of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>-built products does not need expertise in 
              molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. Once a manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is developed, 
              product designers can use it to build anything from cars to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              simply by reusing low-level <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> designs that have previously 
              been developed. A designer may safely be allowed to play with pieces 
              1,000 atoms on a side (one billion atoms in volume), assuming they 
              have featureless surfaces. This is several times smaller than a 
              bacterium and 10,000,000 times smaller than a car. </p>
<p>Working with modular "building blocks" of this size would allow 
              almost anything to be designed and built, but the blocks would be 
              too big to do the kind of molecular manipulation that is necessary 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing or to participate in biochemical reactions. 
              A single block could contain a tiny motor or a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, allowing 
              products to be powered and responsive. As long as no block contained 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to do mechanochemistry, the designer could not create 
              a new kind of nanofactory.</p>
<p>Once designed and built, a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> product could be used by consumers 
              just like a steel or plastic product. Of course, some products, 
              such as cars, knives, and nail guns, are dangerous by design, but 
              this kind of danger is one that we already know how to deal with. 
              In the United States, Underwriter's Laboratories (UL), the Food 
              and Drug Administration, and a host of industry and consumer organizations 
              work to ensure that our products are as safe as we expect them to 
              be. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> products could be regulated in the same way. And if 
              a nanofactory could only make approved products, it could be widely 
              distributed, even for home use, without introducing any special 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> risks.</p>
<h2><b>Nanofactory <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>: Regulating Risk, Preserving Benefit</b></h2>
<p>It is generally assumed, incorrectly, that <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s built with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              must be quite small. This has led to fears that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be hard to control and easy to steal. In fact, as analyzed 
              by Drexler and others in the field, the products of nano-scale mechanochemical 
              plants can be attached together within the enclosure of a single 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Small building blocks can be joined to make bigger blocks; 
              these blocks can be joined with others, and so on to form a product. 
              This process is called <i>convergent assembly</i>, and it allows 
              the creation of large products from nano-scale parts. In particular, 
              convergent assembly will allow one nanofactory to build another 
              nanofactory. There is no need to use trillions of free-floating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> robots; instead, the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s are securely fastened 
              inside the factory <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, where they feed the smallest conveyor 
              belts. </p>
<p>A typical nanofactory might be the size of a microwave oven. Since 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s are fastened into the factory and dependent on its 
              power grid, they have no need to navigate around the product they 
              are building&#8212;this improves efficiency&#8212;and they have no chance of 
              functioning independently. In addition, the entire nanofactory can 
              be controlled through a single <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>, which allows restrictions 
              to be built into the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. It can simply refuse to produce 
              any product that has not been approved. (The improved security of 
              tethered <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> factories has been a theme in at least one work 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a><a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.) 
            </p>
<p>If a nanofactory will only build safe products, and will refuse 
              to build any product that has not been approved as safe, then the 
              factory itself can be considered safe. It could even build a duplicate 
              nanofactory on request. With the restrictions built in, the second 
              one would be as safe as the first. As long as the restrictions work 
              as planned, there is no risk of gray goo, no risk of undesirable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s or unapproved products, and no risk of producing unrestricted 
              nanofactories that could be used to make bad products. </p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, products that were approved could be produced 
              in any quantity desired. The products could even be customized, 
              within limits&#8212;and the limits could be quite broad, for some kinds 
              of products. If desired, the nanofactories (and the products) could 
              have tracking <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s built in to further deter inappropriate use.</p>
<p>With nanofactories that can only produce approved designs, the 
              safety of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing does not depend on restricting 
              the use of the factories. Instead, it depends on choosing correctly 
              which products to approve. The nanofactory itself, as a product, 
              can be approved for unlimited copying. This means that the abundant, 
              cheap, and convenient production capability of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              can be achieved without the risks associated with uncontrolled <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> 
              manufacturing. A two-dimensional view of the risks of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              <i>which separates the means of production from the products,</i> 
              allows the design and <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation of policy that is minimally 
              restrictive, yet still safe.</p>
<h2><b>Using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> Safely</b></h2>
<p>A safe nanofactory design must build approved products while refusing 
              to build unapproved products. It must also be extremely tamper-resistant; 
              if anyone found a way to build unapproved products, they could make 
              an unrestricted, unsafe nanofactory and distribute copies of it. 
              The product approval process must also be carefully designed to 
              maximize the benefits of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> while minimizing the risk 
              of misuse. Restricted nanofactories avoid the extreme risk/benefit 
              tradeoff of other <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> administration plans, but they do require 
              competent administration.</p>
<p>One way to secure a nanofactory is to build in only a limited <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of safe designs. The user could ask it to produce any one of those 
              designs, but with no way to feed in more blueprints, the factory 
              could never build anything else. This simple scheme is fairly reliable, 
              but not very useful. It also poses the risk that someone could take 
              apart the factory and find a way to reprogram its design library. 
            </p>
<p>A more useful and secure scheme would be to connect the nanofactory 
              to a central controller, and require it to ask for permission each 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it was asked to manufacture something. This would allow new 
              designs to be added to the design library after the nanofactory 
              was built. In addition, the nanofactory would have to report its 
              status back to the central controller. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could even be 
              designed to require a continuous connection; a factory disconnected 
              from the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> would permanently disable itself. </p>
<p>This would greatly reduce the opportunity to take the factory apart, 
              since it could report the attempt in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and failed attempts 
              would result in immediate arrest of the perpetrator. This permanent 
              connection would also allow the factory to be disabled remotely 
              if a security flaw were ever discovered in that model. Finally, 
              a physical connection would allow the location of the factory to 
              be known and jurisdictional limits to be imposed on its products.</p>
<p>Current cryptographic techniques permit verification and <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> over an unsecured link<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. 
              These are used in smart cards and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_phone_entry.html">cellular phone</a>s, and will 
              soon be used in <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> rights management<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. 
              Using such techniques, each nanofactory would be able to verify 
              that it was in <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> with the central library. Only designs 
              from the library could be manufactured. In addition, each design 
              could come with a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of restrictions. </p>
<p>For example, medical tools might only be manufactured at the request 
              of a doctor. <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">Commercial</a> designs could require payment from a user. 
              Designs under development could be manufactured only by the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, 
              until they were approved and released. A design that did not come 
              from the central library would not have the proper cryptographic 
              signature and the factory would simply refuse to build it.</p>
<h2><b>Product Design <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">Parameter</a>s</b></h2>
<p>Rapid innovation is a key benefit of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. The rapid 
              and flexible manufacturing process allows a design to be built and 
              tested almost immediately. Because designers of nano-built products 
              do not have to do any actual <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, a high level of 
              innovation can be accommodated without giving designers any <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> 
              to dangerous kinds of products. As mentioned above, a design with 
              billion-<a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, sub-micron blocks&#8212;permitting specification of near-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>&#8212;would still pose no risk of illicit <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>. 
              The minimum building block size in a design could be restricted 
              by the design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. A fully automated evaluation and approval 
              process could also consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and power contained in the 
              design, its mechanical integrity, and the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power 
              built in. The block-based design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> provides a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> 
              to the block-based convergent assembly <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. A variety of design 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could be <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed using the same nanofactory <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, 
              and the designer would not have to become an expert on the process 
              of construction to create buildable designs.</p>
<p>With a safe-design nanofactory, adults&#8212;and even children&#8212;could 
              safely play with advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, inventing and constructing almost 
              anything they could imagine. (Today, adults as well as children 
              find it worthwhile to play with the Lego MindStorms <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a><a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.) More powerful products would require an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              certification. This could be given to any responsible adult, since 
              even a malicious product <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er would be unable to bypass the 
              factory's <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming and cause it to make illicit fabricators. 
              A product that included chemical or nanomechanical manipulation 
              ability would have to be carefully controlled, even during the design 
              phase, to prevent the designer from building something that could 
              be used for illicit nanomanufacturing.</p>
<p>Risks and dangers associated with products could be assessed on 
              a per-product basis. Many products produced with simplified design 
              kits could be approved with only automated analysis of their design. 
              Most others could be approved after a safety and efficacy assessment 
              similar to today's approval processes. Only rarely would a new degree 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological functionality be required, so each case could 
              be carefully assessed before the functionality was added to appropriately 
              restricted design <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. </p>
<p>Product approval for worldwide availability could depend on any 
              of several factors. First, unless designed with a child-safe design 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, it could be evaluated for <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering safety. Second, if 
              the design incorporated <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>, the owner of the 
              property could specify licensing terms. Third, local jurisdictional 
              restrictions could be imposed, tagging the file according to where 
              it could and could not be manufactured. Finally, the design would 
              be placed in the global catalog, available for anyone to use.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> offers the ability to build large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of products 
              that are incredibly powerful by today's standards. This possibility 
              creates both opportunity and risk. The problem of minimizing the 
              risk is not simple; excessive restriction creates black markets, 
              which in this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> implies unrestricted nanofabrication. Selecting 
              the proper level of restriction is likely to pose a difficult challenge.</p>
<p>This paper describes a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that allows the risk to be dealt 
              with on two separate fronts: control of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> and control of the products. Such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has many advantages. 
              A well-controlled manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can be widely deployed, allowing 
              distributed, cheap, high-volume manufacturing of useful products 
              and even a degree of distributed innovation. The range of possible 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>-built products is almost infinite. Even if allowable products 
              were restricted to a small subset of possible designs, it would 
              still allow an explosion of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and functionality.</p>
<p>Preventing a nanofactory from building unapproved products can 
              be done using technologies already in use today. It appears that 
              the nanofactory control <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> can be made virtually unbreakable. 
              Product approval, by contrast, depends to some extent on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> institutions. 
              With a block-based design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, many products can be assessed 
              for degree of danger without the need for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intervention; this 
              reduces subjectivity and delay, and allows people to focus on the 
              few truly risky designs.</p>
<p>In addition to preventing the creation of unrestricted <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> 
              manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, further regulation will be necessary to preserve 
              the interests of existing <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> institutions. 
              For example, the effects of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on intellectual 
              property rights have created concern in several industries<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, 
              and the ability to fabricate anything will surely increase the problem. 
              National security will demand limits on the <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s that can be 
              produced. </p>
<p>Forthcoming papers will give recommendations for a multi-purpose 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of administration that preserves <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> rights and security 
              imperatives while still allowing humanitarian and innovative use.</p>
<p>This paper has outlined a scenario for the safe development and 
              use of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological manufacturing. Unrestricted <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> 
              manufacturing creates several high-stakes risks. The use of a restricted 
              nanofactory design that is safe for widespread deployment can mitigate 
              some of these risks, and other risks can be dealt with piecemeal 
              by making many low-stakes decisions about the factory's products. 
              Careful attention must be paid to security during the initial nanofactory 
              development, and wise administration must be <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed to prevent 
              both undesired products and pressure for black markets or independent 
              development. With these caveats, however, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> presented here 
              preserves almost all the benefits of unrestricted <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              while greatly reducing the associated risks.<br>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a>*Definitions of technical terms used in this article.</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a></b>: A small nano-robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that can use surrounding 
              chemicals to manufacture nanoscale products. Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> 
              designs could work together to build macroscale products; this would 
              require <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> and navigation capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Convergent assembly</b>: A process of fastening small parts 
              to obtain larger parts, then fastening those to make still larger 
              parts, and so on. Convergent assembly can be used to build a product 
              from many, much smaller, <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s.</p>
<p><b>Macroscale</b>: Larger than nanoscale; often implies a design 
              that humans can directly interact with. Too large to be built by 
              a single <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> (one cubic micron of diamond contains 176 billion 
              atoms).</p>
<p><b>Mechanochemistry</b>: <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a> accomplished by mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              directly controlling the reactant <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p>
<p><b>Molecular manufacturing</b>: The building of complex <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              by mechanochemical processes.</p>
<p><b>Nanofactory</b>: A self-contained macroscale manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, 
              consisting of many molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s feeding a convergent 
              assembly <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p><b>Nanomechanical</b>: Being mechanical and very small; for example, 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that can manipulate single <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p>
<p><b>Nanoscale</b>: Significantly smaller than a micron; on the scale 
              of large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s; capable of interacting with <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s; capable 
              of being built by a single <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>.</p>
<h2><b>About CRN</b></h2>
<p>The Center for Responsible <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> (CRN) is a non-profit 
              organization dedicated to bringing about safe and effective molecular 
              manufacturing (nanofactory <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>) that benefits all the world's 
              people. CRN is involved in studying, formulating, and writing about 
              wise policies for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> administration. For more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>,

<br>
<br>
Literally. I couldn't care even if I wanted to. Advanced nanotech is so far out of my range of comprehension, so far out of my grasp, that even if the technology was freely available, I wouldn't know how to use it. I wouldn't have the resources, the sensitive materials, the programming knowledge, etc. I can't participate in the debate.
<br>
<br>
Thank you, dumbing-down industrial-age education! Go ahead! Regulate the crap out of it, or don't. :/</p></td>
