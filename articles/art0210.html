<div class="TeaserText">Texas wants to be the nanotech equivalent of Silicon Valley. It has a good start north of Dallas: big bucks, top talent, leading university, and proximity to nanotech pioneering company Zyvex and the Telecom Corridor. But other centers around the country are also in the race to lead the nano world.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published June 11, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>"The <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of the small received a big step forward," said Texas state representative Brian McCall in announcing state funding of $500,000 for a new interdisciplinary <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225172117/http://www.utdallas.edu/" target="_new">Center at the University of Texas at Dallas</a>.

<p>The funding complements a $2.5 million-dollar donation by James Von Ehr II, founder and CEO of <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a>, the first molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> company.

<br>
</p>
<p>The University of Texas at Dallas has recruited two <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> pioneers to lead the revolution. Dr. Ray Baughman, a <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">Corporate</a> Fellow at Honeywell International in Morristown, New Jersey, will serve as director of the UTD <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">NanoTech</a> Institute. Baughman has 50 U.S. patents, 170 publications, and a Ph.D. in the materials <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> area from Harvard University. He is well known for his <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, properties, and applications of frontier materials such as <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>.</p>
<p>He will be joined by Dr. Anvar Zakhidov, a Senior Principal Scientist at Honeywell and native of Uzbekistan who has also taught molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> at universities in Japan and Italy. He will assume a full professorship in the UTD Department of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> and work closely with Baughman in establishing and operating the the institute. Zakhidov holds a Ph.D. degree in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> (optics) from the Institute of Spectroscopy of the U.S.S.R. Academy of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>s in Moscow. He is well known for his work in such areas as superconducting fullerides and photoinduced charge transfer in fullerene polymer <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>"Drs. Baughman and Zakhidov bring an extraordinary range of talents to the center," said Von Ehr. "The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers at <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> are excited at the prospect of working with such well-known leaders in the field."</p>
<p>Three other <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers will also join the institute: Dr. Alan Dalton of Trinity University in Dublin, Ireland, Dr. Igor Efimov of Russia from Leicester University in the U.K. and Dr. Edgar Munoz of the University of Saragossa in Spain.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">NanoTech</a> Corridor</h1><p>"With the addition of this new concentration of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al resources, we believe that The University of Texas at Dallas can become the center of a '<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> Corridor,' focused on the tremendous potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>," said Baughman.</p>
<p>The proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> Corridor consists of The University of Texas at Dallas, located at the convergence of Richardson, Plano and Dallas, and <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a>, in Richardson, which plans to drive its <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>.</p>
<p>The company is well positioned for that. <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> has a 20-year <a class="thought" href="entries/visionary_entry.html">visionary</a> plan to create <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for atomically precise manufacturing, using "exponential assembly" to make huge numbers of miniature robotic arms working together to assemble miniature parts and atomic/molecular manipulation, using proximal probes (using a scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a> microscope and atomic force microscope) and developing a nanomanipulator for construction with atomic precision. The company is also developing automated manufacturing--design and construction of <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s capable of handling thousands of sub-micron <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s at high speed, using <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">microelectromechanical systems</a> to prototype <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that can be built today at relatively low cost.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>In addition, <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> is involved with fundamental nanochemistry <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> for modeling and experimental exploration of construction materials and protocols for building <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s from the bottom-up and localized deposition and etching, using directed-beam manipulation of atoms, <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and clusters.</p>
<p>What starts to make this grand vision realistic is that <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> and UTD are located in the heart of the existing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225172117/http://www.telecomcorridor.com/" target="_new">Telecom Corridor</a>, one of the highest concentrations of leading-edge <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-based companies in the world, with about 90,000 workers and nearly 25,000,000 square feet of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>.<br>

<br>
<span class="Caption">Texas Telecom Corridor: five intense miles</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>"There are 700 tech companies in the Telecom Corridor and nearly 2,000 within a ten-mile radius," said Telecom Corridor president Ron <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>. "About 10% might possibly be involved in further development of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>."</p>
<p>"Synergism between the present Telecom Corridor and the evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> Corridor can strengthen both corridors," says Baughman. "For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>ic crystals having nanoscale structural fidelity can <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s." This <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can be critical for companies involved in optical <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing and <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a>-division multiplexing in fiber-optics transmission lines, said Zakhidov, who recently developed the concept of tunable <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>ic crystals<sup>1</sup>. These have potential applications in optoelectronics and <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>.</p>
<p>Several other promising spinoff industries are likely to evolve from Baughman's pioneering <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in developing ultrastrong <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> nanotube fibers<sup>2</sup>, which have an extremely high surface area of more than 300 square meters per gram. This property allows huge amounts of electrical charge to be injected, forming the basis for supercapacitors and electrochemically driven artificial muscles<sup>3</sup> that might be used for <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, nanosize motors, and artificial hearts and limbs</p>
<p>The large surface area might also be used for electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> storage and harvesting. These fibers might some day be woven to create ultrastrong wonder fabrics or even used to tether a satellite to <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, as suggested by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers Yakobson and Smalley.</p>
<p>However, building an ambitious technopolis is not easy, said <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>. "We could become the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> Corridor, but it might take decades to do it and we are just starting. However, we already have a great deal of excitement and activity going on here, so in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of five years we could be well on our way. We have already proposed starting a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> luncheon series in the fall of 2001 and feel an attendance of 100 per month could be developed."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> has also spearheaded the formation of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225172117/http://texasnano.org/" target="_new">Texas</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225172117/http://texasnano.org/" target="_new">Initiative</a>, a statewide effort to bring <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> companies, universities, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers, and funding together to create an environment conducive to the rapid commercialization of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in Texas and position it as the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> State. Key members include UTD, <a class="thought" href="entries/texas_instruments_entry.html">Texas Instruments</a>, SMU, UT Southwestern Medical School, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Business Council, STARTech, Vortex Partners, North Texas <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Council, University of North Texas, University of Texas at Arlington, and Austin Ventures.</p>
<p>The other major <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> effort in Texas is centered around Houston's Rice University Center for Nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">Carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a>nologies Inc., founded in 2000 by a group of Rice University professors. The company has received $15 million venture-capital funding to manufacture <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>--an elongated version of the <a class="thought" href="entries/buckyball_entry.html">buckyball</a>, a discovery that won Rice professors Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl the 1996 Nobel Prize for <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>.</p><h1>Messing with Texas</h1><p>Meanwhile, other areas of the country are revving up their own plans to become the nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a>. "From a funding standpoint, Texas has a ways to go to be number one, but this is a start," said Christine L. Peterson, president of the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a>, noting the $100 million raised by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225172117/http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=00/12/07/2144230&amp;mode=thread" target="_new">California NanoSystems Institute</a>, based in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Other viable contenders include communities around the University of Washington, the Beckman Institute for Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Georgia, she says.<br>

<span class="Caption">Peterson: "cultural barriers"</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>"However, the edges are blurry: much of the R&amp;D at places like <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, MIT and Stanford merges into <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> seamlessly. In the long term, the word '<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>' goes away as it becomes an integral part of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>."</p>
<p>What's more, the biggest barrier to developing scaled-up <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> is cultural, says Peterson, "particularly between chemists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers. There's a shortage of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers who can think in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, and the chemists don't even realize they need them." UTD' s innovative academic plan for the institute should help: it will bring together faculty, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers and students from at least five academic areas in an integrated curriculum including <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s.</p>
<p>"'<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> Corridor' could just be a marketing term, but there's nothing small about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>--it fits well with Texas' big vision. If Texans decide they will be the leaders, they will almost certainly be a major player," concluded Peterson.</p><h1>Footnotes</h1><a name="r1"></a>
