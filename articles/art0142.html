Excerpted version published on KurzweilAI.net March 20, 2001.</p><h1>Abstract</h1><p>The maximum rate of global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> by biovorous self-replicating nanorobots is fundamentally restricted by the replicative strategy employed; by the maximum dispersal <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of mobile replicators; by operational <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> requirements; by the homeostatic resistance of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> ecologies to <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a>; by ecophagic thermal pollution limits (ETPL); and most importantly by our determination and readiness to stop them.</p>
<p>Assuming current and foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>-dissipative designs requiring ~100 MJ/kg for chemical transformations (most likely for biovorous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s), <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> that proceeds slowly enough to add ~4&#176;C to <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> (near the current threshold for immediate climatological detection) will require ~20 months to run to completion; faster ecophagic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s run hotter, allowing quicker detection by policing authorities. All ecophagic scenarios examined appear to permit early detection by vigilant monitoring, thus enabling rapid deployment of effective defensive <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>alities.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Recent discussions [<a href="#r1">1</a>] of the possible dangers posed by <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies such as <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> have made it clear that an intensive theoretical analysis of the major classes of environmental risks of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> (MNT) is warranted. No <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic assessment of the risks and limitations of MNT-based technologies has yet been attempted. This paper represents a first effort to begin this analytical process in a quantitative fashion.</p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest-recognized and best-known danger of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is the risk that self-replicating nanorobots capable of functioning autonomously in the natural environment could quickly convert that natural environment (e.g., "biomass") into replicas of themselves (e.g., "nanomass") on a global basis, a scenario usually referred to as the "gray goo problem" but perhaps more properly termed "global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a>."</p>
<p>As Drexler first warned in <a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a> [<a href="#r2">2</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>"Plants" with "leaves" no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough omnivorous "<a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>" could out-compete real <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>: They could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop--at least if we make no preparation. We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies.</blockquote>
<p>Among the cognoscenti of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, this threat has become known as the "gray goo problem." Though masses of uncontrolled replicators need not be gray or gooey, the term "gray goo" emphasizes that replicators able to obliterate <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> might be less inspiring than a single <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of crabgrass. They might be superior in an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, but this need not make them valuable.</p>
<p>The gray goo threat makes one thing perfectly clear: We cannot afford certain kinds of accidents with replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s.</p>
<p>Gray goo would surely be a depressing ending to our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> adventure on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, far worse than mere fire or ice, and one that could stem from a simple laboratory accident.</p>
<p>Lederberg [<a href="#r3">3</a>] notes that the microbial world is evolving at a fast pace, and suggests that our survival may depend upon embracing a "more microbial point of view." The emergence of new infectious agents such as HIV and Ebola demonstrates that we have as yet little <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how natural or technological disruptions to the environment might trigger mutations in known organisms or unknown extant organisms [<a href="#r81">81</a>], producing a limited form of "green goo" [<a href="#r92">92</a>].</p>
<p>However, biovorous nanorobots capable of comprehensive <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> will not be easy to build and their design will require exquisite attention to numerous complex specifications and operational challenges. Such biovores can emerge only after a lengthy period of purposeful focused effort, or as a result of deliberate experiments aimed at creating general-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, perhaps by employing <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s, and are highly unlikely to arise solely by accident.</p><h1>The Ecophagic Threat</h1><p>Classical molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> [<a href="2">2</a>], <a href="#r4">4</a>] envisions nanomachines predominantly composed of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-rich diamondoid materials. Other useful nanochemistries might employ aluminum-rich sapphire (Al2O3) materials, boron-rich (BN) or titanium-rich (TiC) materials, and the like. TiC has one the highest possible operating temperatures allowed for commonplace materials (melting point ~3410&#176;K [<a href="#r5">5</a>]), and while diamond can scratch TiC, TiC can be used to melt diamond.</p>
<p>However, atoms of Al, Ti and B are far more abundant in the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s crust (81,300 ppm, 4400 ppm and 3 ppm, respectively [<a href="#r5">5</a>]) than in biomass, e.g., the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body (0.1 ppm, 0 ppm, and 0.03 ppm [<a href="#r6">6</a>]), reducing the direct threat of <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> by such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. On the other hand, <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> is a thousand times less abundant in crustal rocks (320 ppm, mostly <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>ates) than in the biosphere (~230,000 ppm).</p>
<p>Furthermore, conversion of the lithosphere into nanomachinery is not a primary concern because ordinary rocks typically contain relatively scarce sources of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. For instance, natural radioactive isotopes present in crustal rocks vary greatly as a function of the geological composition and <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of a region, but generally range from 0.15-1.40 mGy/yr [<a href="#r7">7</a>], giving a raw power density of 0.28-2.6 &#215;10<sup>-7</sup> W/m<sup>3</sup> assuming crustal rocks of approximately mean terrestrial density (5522 kg/m<sup>3</sup> [<a href="#r5">5</a>]).</p>
<p>This is quite insufficient to power nanorobots capable of significant activities; current nanomachine designs typically require power densities on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> W/m<sup>3</sup> to achieve effective results [<a href="#r6">6</a>]. (<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s typically operate at 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> W/m<sup>3</sup> [<a href="#r6">6</a>].) Solar power is not readily available below the surface, and the mean geothermal heat flow is only 0.05 W/m<sup>2</sup> at the surface [<a href="#r6">6</a>], just a tiny fraction of solar insolation.</p>
<p>Hypothesized crustal abiotic highly-reduced petroleum reserves [<a href="#r16">16</a>] probably could not energize significant replicator nanomass <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> due to the anoxic environment deep underground, although potentially large geobacterial populations have been described [<a href="10">10</a>-<a href="#r16">16</a>] and in principle some unusual though highly limited <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> sources could also be tapped by nanorobots.</p>
<p>For example, some anaerobic <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> use metals (instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>) as <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>-acceptors [<a href="#r13">13</a>], with iron present in minerals such as pyroxene or olivine being converted to iron in a more oxidized state in magnetic minerals such as magnetite and maghemite, and using geochemically produced <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> to reduce CO2 to methane [<a href="#r11">11</a>]. Underground <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> in the Antrim Shale deposit produce 1.2 &#215;10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/day of natural gas (methane) by consuming the 370 MY-old remains of ancient algae [<a href="#r17">17</a>].</p>
<p>Bioremediation experiments have also been done by Envirogen and others in which pollution-eating <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> are purposely injected into the ground to metabolize organic toxins; in field tests it has proven difficult to get the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> to move through underground aquifers, because the negatively-charged cells tend to adhere to positively charged iron oxides in the soil [<a href="#r18">18</a>].</p>
<p>However, the primary ecophagic concern is that runaway nanorobotic replicators or "replibots" will convert the entire surface biosphere (the <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> of all living things on the surface of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>) into alternative or artificial materials of some type--especially, materials like themselves, e.g., more self-replicating nanorobots.</p>
<p>Since advanced nanorobots might be constructed predominantly of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-rich diamondoid materials [<a href="#r4">4</a>], and since ~12% of all atoms in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body (representative of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> generally) are <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms [<a href="#r6">6</a>], or ~23% by weight, the global <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> inventory may support the self-manufacture of a final mass of replicating diamondoid nanorobots on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of ~0.23 <i>M</i>bio, where <i>M</i>bio is the total global biomass.</p>
<p>Unlike almost any other natural material, biomass can serve both as a source of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> and as a source of power for nanomachine replication. Ecophagic nanorobots would regard living things as environmental <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> accumulators, and biomass as a valuable ore to be mined for <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. Of course, biosystems from which all <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> has been extracted can no longer be alive but would instead become lifeless chemical sludge.</p><h1>Additional Scenarios</h1><p>Four related scenarios which may lead indirectly to global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> have been identified and are described below. In all cases, early detection appears feasible with advance preparation, and adequate defenses are readily conceived using molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies of comparable sophistication.</p><h1>Gray Plankton</h1><p>The existence of 1-2 &#215;10<sup>16</sup> kg [<a href="#r24">24</a>] of global undersea <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> storage on continental margins as CH4 clathrates and a like amount (3.8 &#215;10<sup>16</sup> kg) of seawater-dissolved <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> as CO2 represent a <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> inventory more than an <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of magnitude larger than in the global biomass. Methane and CO2 can in principle be combined to form free <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> and water, plus 0.5 MJ/kg <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> of free <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. (Some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers are studying the possibility of reducing greenhouse gas accumulations by storing liquid [<a href="#r44">44</a>] or solid [<a href="#r45">45</a>] CO2 on the ocean floor, which could potentially enable seabed replibots to more easily metabolize methane sources.)</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">Oxygen</a> could also be imported from the surface in pressurized microtanks via buoyancy transport, with the conversion of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> clathrates to nanomass taking place on the seabed below. The subsequent colonization of the land-based <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-rich <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> by a large and hungry seabed-grown replicator population is the "gray plankton" scenario. (Phytoplankton, 1-200 microns in size, are the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s most responsible for the variable optical properties of oceanic water because of the strong absorption of these cells in the blue and red portions of the optical spectrum [<a href="#r37">37</a>].)</p>
<p>If not largely confined to the sea floor during most of their replication cycle, the natural <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> ratio could increase by many orders of magnitude, requiring a more diligent census effort. Census-taking nanorobots can alternatively be used to identify, disable, knapsack or destroy the gray plankton <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.</p><h1>Gray Dust (Aerovores)</h1><p>Traditional diamondoid nanomachinery designs [<a href="#r4">4</a>] have employed 8 primary chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, along with the associated atmospheric abundances [<a href="#r46">46</a>] of each <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>. (<a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> is present in air as particulate dust which may be taken as ~28% Si for crustal rock [<a href="#r5">5</a>], with a global average dust concentration of ~0.0025 mg/m<sup>3</sup>). The requirement for <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s that are relatively rare in the atmosphere greatly constrains the potential nanomass and <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate of airborne replicators.</p>
<p>However, note that at least one of the classical designs exceeds 91% CHON by weight. Although it would be very difficult, it is at least theoretically possible that replicators could be constructed almost solely of CHON, in which case such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s could replicate relatively rapidly using only atmospheric resources, powered by sunlight. A worldwide blanket of airborne replicating dust or "aerovores" that blots out all sunlight has been called the "gray dust" scenario [<a href="#r47">47</a>]. (There have already been numerous experimental aerial releases of recombinant <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> [<a href="#r48">48</a>].)</p>
<p>The most efficient cleanup strategy appears to be the use of air-dropped non-self-replicating nanorobots equipped with prehensile microdragnets.</p>
<p>Alternative airborne or ground-based atmospheric filtration <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s that could permit more rapid filtering are readily envisioned. For example, since drag power varies as the square of the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>, then by increasing mesh volume 10,000-fold while decreasing airflow <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> 100-fold, total drag power remains unchanged but whole-atmosphere turnover proceeds 100-fold faster, e.g., ~15 minutes.</p><h1>Gray Lichens</h1><p>Colonies of symbiotic algae and fungi known as lichens (which some have called a form of sub-aerial biofilm) are among the first plants to grow on bare stone, helping in soil formation by slowly etching the rock [<a href="#r55">55</a>]. Lithobiontic microbial communities such as crustose saxicolous lichens penetrate mineral surfaces up to depths of 1 cm using a complex dissolution, selective transport, and recrystallization process sometimes termed "<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> weathering" [<a href="#r56">56</a>].</p>
<p>Colonies of epilithic (living on rock surfaces) microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> produce a 10 micron thick patina on desert rocks (called "desert varnish" [<a href="#r57">57</a>]) consisting of trace amounts of Mn and Fe oxides that help to provide protection from heat and UV radiation [<a href="57">57</a>-<a href="#r59">59</a>].</p>
<p>In theory, replicating nanorobots could be made almost entirely of nondiamondoid materials including noncarbon chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s found in great abundance in rock such as <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, aluminum, iron, titanium and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>. The subsequent ecophagic destruction of land-based <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> by a maliciously <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med noncarbon epilithic replicator population that has grown into a significant nanomass is the "gray lichen" scenario.</p>
<p>Continuous direct census sampling of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s land surfaces will almost certainly allow early detection, since mineralogical nanorobots should be easily distinguishable from inert rock <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s and from organic microbes in the top 3-8 cm of soil.</p><h1>Malicious <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">Ecophagy</a></h1><p>More difficult scenarios involve ecophagic attacks that are launched not to convert biomass to nanomass, but rather primarily to destroy biomass. The optimal malicious ecophagic attack strategy appears to involve a two-phase process.</p>
<p>In the first phase, initial seed replibots are widely distributed in the vicinity of the target biomass, replicating with maximum stealth up to some critical population size by consuming local environmental <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> to build nanomass. In the second phase, the now-large replibot population ceases replication and exclusively undertakes its primary destructive purpose. More generally, this strategy may be described as Build/Destroy.</p>
<p>During the Build phase of the malicious "badbots," and assuming technological equivalence, defensive "goodbots" enjoy at least three important tactical advantages over their adversaries:</p>
<p>1. Preparation--defensive agencies can manufacture and position in advance overwhelming quantities of (ideally, non-self-replicating) defensive <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>alities, e.g., goodbots, which can immediately be deployed at the first sign of trouble, with minimal additional risk to the environment;</p>
<p>2. Efficiency--while badbots must simultaneously replicate and defend themselves against attack (either actively or by maintaining stealth), goodbots may concentrate exclusively on attacking badbots (e.g., because of their large numerical superiority in an early deployment) and thus enjoy lower operational overhead and higher efficiency in achieving their purpose, all else equal; and</p>
<p>3. Leverage--in terms of materials, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and sophistication, fewer resources are generally required to confine, disable, or destroy a complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> than are required to build or replicate the same complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> from scratch (e.g., one small bomb can destroy a large bomb-making factory; one small missile can sink a large ship).</p>
<p>It is most advantageous to engage a malicious ecophagic threat while it is still in its Build phase. This requires foresight and a commitment to extensive surveillance by the defensive authorities.</p><h1>Conclusions and Public Policy Recommendations</h1><p>The smallest plausible biovorous nanoreplicator has a molecular weight of ~1 gigadalton and a minimum replication <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of perhaps ~100 seconds, in theory permitting global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> to be completed in as few as ~10<sup>4</sup> seconds. However, such rapid replication creates an immediately detectable thermal signature enabling effective defensive policing <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>alities to be promptly deployed before significant damage to the <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> can occur.</p>
<p>Such defensive <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>alities will generate their own thermal pollution during defensive operations. This should not significantly limit the defense strategy because knapsacking, disabling or destroying a working nanoreplicator should consume far less <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> than is consumed by a nanoreplicator during a single replication cycle, hence such defensive operations are effectively endothermic.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">Ecophagy</a> that proceeds near the current threshold for immediate climatological detection, adding perhaps ~4&#176;C to <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>, may require ~20 months to run to completion, which is plenty of advance warning to mount an effective defense.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">Ecophagy</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>es slowly enough to evade easy detection by thermal monitoring alone would require many years to run to completion, could still be detected by direct in situ surveillance, and may be at least partially offset by increased biomass <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rates due to natural homeostatic compensation mechanisms inherent in the terrestrial <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">Ecophagy</a> accomplished indirectly by a replibot population pre-grown on <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> may be avoided by diligent thermal monitoring and direct census sampling of relevant terrestrial niches to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for growing, possibly dangerous, pre-ecophagous nanorobot populations.</p>
<p>Specific public policy recommendations suggested by the results of the present analysis include:</p>
<p>1. An immediate international moratorium on all <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> experiments implemented as <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, "<a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>" is defined as autonomous foraging replicators, excluding purely <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> implementations (already covered by <a class="thought" href="entries/nih_entry.html">NIH</a> guidelines [<a href="#r65">65</a>] tacitly accepted worldwide) and also excluding <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> simulations which are essential preparatory work and should continue. Alternative "inherently safe" replication strategies such as the broadcast <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> [<a href="#r66">66</a>] are already well-known.</p>
<p>2. Continuous comprehensive infrared surveillance of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s surface by geostationary satellites, both to monitor the current biomass inventory and to detect (and then investigate) any rapidly-developing artificial hotspots. This could be an extension of current or proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>-monitoring <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> Observing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a> [<a href="#r67">67</a>]and disease remote-sensing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s [<a href="#r93">93</a>]) originally intended to understand and predict <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>, changes in land use, and so forth--initially using non-nanoscale technologies. Other methods of detection are feasible and further <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is required to identify and properly evaluate the full range of alternatives.</p>
<p>3. Initiating a long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> designed to acquire the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and capability needed to counteract ecophagic replicators, including scenario-building and threat analysis with numerical simulations, measure/countermeasure analysis, theory and design of global monitoring <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s capable of fast detection and response, IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) discrimination protocols, and eventually the design of relevant nanorobotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>ic defensive capabilities and infrastructure. </p>
<p>A related long-term recommendation is to initiate a global <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of comprehensive in situ ecosphere surveillance, potentially including possible nanorobot activity signatures (e.g. changes in greenhouse gas concentrations), multispectral surface imaging to detect disguised signatures, and direct local nanorobot census sampling on land, sea, and air, as warranted by the pace of development of new MNT capabilities.</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>The author thanks Robert J.

<br>
<br>
A 104-second window for complete global ecophagy seems a bit fast for sufficient reaction time to circumvent utter annihilation or at least a very near extinction.  Are you suggesting that some government agency stockpile enough varying 'goodbots' to effectively combat any scenario?  
<br>
<br>
Without prior stockpiling or amassing of goodbots, there will not be enough time to respond and avoid severe damage to the world's biomass - which includes us.  Where will they store such masses and how much is enough?  Who then will be in control of the purple button to release the goodbots?  What is the chance that these goodbots and/or badbots will engineer a way to recombine as well as replicate, becoming camouflaged and/or unstoppable, much like HIV and other recombinant viruses?
<br>
<br>
Now, I realize the 104-second window was the fastest conceivably plausible, today, or when you wrote this article, but, as we progress faster than most can track, what's to stop the use of microorganisms present in the crust and many others that we have not mapped yet, deeper down?
<br>
<br>
I appreciate your article, for the very fact it has allowed me to rest somewhat easier, yet I feel not even the surface of this rock has been scratched.  Your article proves that the threat is real and I question the efficacy and strategy of those who'd prevent it.  If the defense strategy cooked up works anything like the proposed missile defense system, we are doomed to extinction.

If you spend enough time at this forum, you find yourself repeating the same arguments over and over, because there are always newcomers ariving with questions asked by others.
<br>
<br>
It would make life so much simpler if I could quickly navigate to earlier replies or posts of mine that answer those FAQs, and it would also help me expand my own knowledge by aiding my recollection of ideas, building on strong ideas I had in the past, retracting ideas that I later learned were unworkable.
