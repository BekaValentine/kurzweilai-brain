<div class="TeaserText">Are we on the verge of an apocalyptic era? Robert Wright applies game theory to evolution, illustrating how the interdependence and competition between organisms lead to biological, cultural and technological evolution, with chaos and upheaval thrown in the mix.</div>
<br>
<br><blockquote>A great many internal and external portents (political and social upheaval, moral and religious unease) have caused us all to feel, more or less confusedlv, that something tremendous is at present taking place in the world. But what is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>--Teilhard de Chardin</blockquote>
<p>Originally published January 1, 2001 as the introduction to <i>Nonzero: The <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Destiny</i>. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 2, 2001.</p>
<p>The Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg once ended a book on this note:</p>
<blockquote>"The more the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless."</blockquote>
<p>Far be it from me to argue with a great physicist about how depressing <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> is. For all I know, Weinberg's realm of expertise, the realm of inanimate <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, really does offer no evidence of higher purpose. But when we move into the realm of animate <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>--<a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, cellular slime molds, and, most notably, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings--the situation strikes me as different. The more closely we examine the drift of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and, especially, the drift of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, the more there seems to be a point to it all. Because in neither case is "drift" really the right word. Both of these processes have a direction, an arrow. At least, that is the thesis of this hook.</p>
<p>People who see a direction in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, or in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, or both, have often been dismissed as mystics or flakes. In some ways, it's hard to argue that they deserve better treatment. The philosopher Henri Bergson believed that organic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is driven forward by a mysterious "elan vital," a vital force. But why posit something so ethereal when we can explain <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>'s workings in the wholly physical terms of natural selection? Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the Jesuit theologian, saw <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> moving toward "Point Omega." But how seriously could he expect historians to take him, given that Point Omega is "outside <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a>"?</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have to give Bergson and Teilhard de Chardin some credit. Both saw that organic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has a tendency to create forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> featuring greater and greater <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. And Teilhard de Chardin, in particular, stressed a comparable tendency in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>: the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, over the millennia, of ever more vast and complex social structures. His extrapolations from this trend were prescient. Writing at the middle of this century, he dwelt on <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>, and the globalization it abets, before these subjects were all the rage. (Marshall McLuhan, coiner of "global village," had read Teilhard.) With his concept of the "noosphere," the "<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> envelope of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>," Teilhard even anticipated in a vague way the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--more than a decade before the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the microchip.</p>
<p>Can the trends rightly noted by Bergson and Teilhard--<a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> tendencies in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and in the technological and social <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>--be explained in scientific, physical terms? I think so; that is largely what this book [<i>Nonzero</i>] is about. But the concreteness of the explanation needn't, I believe, wholly drain these patterns of the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> that Bergson and Teilhard imputed to them. If directionality is built into <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>--if <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> naturally moves toward a particular end--then this movement legitimately invites speculation about what did the building. And the invitation is especially strong, I'll argue, in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of the phase of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> that seems to lie immediately ahead--a social, political, and even moral culmination of sorts.</p>
<p>As readers not drawn to theological questions will be delighted to hear, such speculation constitutes a small portion of the book <i>Nonzero</i>: a few cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s toward the end, necessarily tentative. Mostly it is about how we got where we are today, and what this tells us about where we're heading next.</p><h1>THE SECRET OF <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">LIFE</a></h1><p>On the day James Watson and <a class="thought" href="entries/crick_entry.html">Francis Crick</a> discovered the structure of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, Crick, as Watson later recalled it, walked into their regular lunch place and announced that they had "found the secret of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>." With all due respect for <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, I would like to nominate another candidate for the secret of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/crick_entry.html">Francis Crick</a>, I can't claim to have discovered the secret I'm touting. It was discovered--or, if you prefer, invented--about half a century ago by the founders of <a class="thought" href="entries/game_theory_entry.html">game theory</a>, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern.</p>
<p>They made a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> distinction between "zero-sum" games and "non-zero-sum" games. In zero-sum games, the fortunes of the players are inversely related. In tennis, in <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, in boxing, one contestant's gain is the other's loss. In non-zero-sum games, one player's gain needn't be bad news for the other(s). Indeed, in highly non-zero-sum games the players' interests overlap entirely. In 1970, when the three Apollo 13 astronauts were trying to figure out how to get their stranded spaceship back to <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>, they were playing an utterly non-zero-sum game, because the outcome would be either equally good for all of them or equally bad. (It was equally good.)</p>
<p>Back in the real world, things are usually not so clear-cut. A merchant and a customer, two members of a legislature, two childhood friends sometimes--but not always--find their interests overlapping. To the extent that their interests do overlap, their relationship is nonzero-sum; the outcome can be win-win or lose-lose, depending on how they play the game.</p>
<p>Sometimes political scientists or economists break <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> interaction down into zero-sum and non-zero-sum <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. Occasionally, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary biologists do the same in looking at the way various living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s work. My <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ion is that, if we want to see what drives the direction of both <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and organic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, we should apply this perspective more <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically. Interaction among individual genes, or cells, or <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, among interest groups, or nations, or corporations, can be viewed through the lenses of <a class="thought" href="entries/game_theory_entry.html">game theory</a>. What follows is a survey of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, and of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, with those lenses in place. My hope is to illuminate a kind of force-the non-zero-sum dynamic-that has crucially shaped the unfolding of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> so far.</p>
<p>The survey of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is brief, and the survey of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> not so brief. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, after all, is notoriously messy. But I don't think it's nearly as messy as it's often made out to be. Indeed, even if you start the survey back when the most complex society on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> was a <a class="thought" href="entries/hunter_gatherer_entry.html">hunter-gatherer</a> village, and follow it up to the present, you can capture <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> trajectory by reference to a core pattern:</p>
<p>New technologies arise that permit or encourage new, richer forms of non-zero-sum interaction; then (for intelligible <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s grounded ultimately in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>) social structures evolve that realize this rich potential--that convert non-zero-sum situations into positive sums. Thus does social <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> grow in scope and depth.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that non-zero-sum games always have win-win outcomes rather than lose-lose outcomes. Nor is it to say that the powerful and the treacherous never exploit the weak and the naive; parasitic behavior is often possible in non-zero-sum games, and <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> offers no shortage of examples. Still, on balance, over the long run, non-zero-sum situations produce more positive sums than negative sums, more mutual benefit than parasitism. As a result, people become embedded in larger and richer webs of interdependence.</p>
<p>This <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> sequence--the conversion of non-zero-sum situations into mostly positive sums--had started happening at least as early as 15,000 years ago. Then it happened again. And again. And again. Until--voila!--here we are, riding in airplanes, sending e-mail, living in a global village.</p>
<p>I don't mean to minimize the interesting details that populate most <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> books: Sumerian kings, barbarian hordes, medieval knights, the Protestant Reformation, nascent nationalism, and so on. In fact, I try to give all of these their due (along with such too-often-neglected exemplars of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> experience as native American <a class="thought" href="entries/hunter_gatherer_entry.html">hunter-gatherer</a>s, Polynesian chiefdoms, Islamic commercial innovations, African kingdoms, Aztec justice, and precocious Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>). But I do intend to show how these details, though important in their own right, are ultimately part of a larger story--to show how they fit into a framework that makes <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> easier.</p>
<p>After surveying <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, I will briefly apply to organic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> the same organizing principle. Through natural selection, there arise new "technologies" that permit richer forms of non-zero-sum interaction among <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities: among genes, or cells, or <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, or whatever. And the rest, as they say, is organic <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>In short, both organic and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> involve the playing of ever-more-numerous, ever-larger, and ever-more-elaborate non-zero-sum games. It is the accumulation of these games--game upon game upon game--that constitutes the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and social <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that people like Bergson and Teithard de Chardin have talked about. I like to refer to this accumulation as an accumulation of "non-zero-sumness." Non-zero-sumness is a kind of potential--a potential for overall gain, or for overall loss, depending on how the game is played. The concept may sound ethereal in the abstract, but I hope it will feel concrete by the end of this book [<i>Nonzero</i>]. Non-zero-sunmess, I'll argue, is something whose ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and ongoing fulfillment define the arrow of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, from the primordial soup to the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
<p>You might even say that non-zero-sumness is a nuts-and-bolts, materialist version of Bergson's immaterial &#233;lan vital; it gives a certain momentum to the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> direction of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. It explains why <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, given enough <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, was very likely to create highly intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>--<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> smart enough to generate <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and other forms of culture. It also explains why the ensuing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and of culture more broadly was very likely to enrich and expand the social structure of that intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, carrying social organization to <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary breadth. Globalization, it seems to me, has been in the cards not just since the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the telegraph or the steamship, or even the written word or the wheel, but since the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. All along, the relentless <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> of non-zero-sumness has been pointing toward this age in which relations among nations are growing more non-zero-sum year by year.</p><h1>YOU CALL THAT DESTINY?</h1><p>Any book with a subtitle as grandiose as "The <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Destiny" is bound to have some mealy-mouthed qualification somewhere along the way. We might as well get it over with.</p>
<p>How literally do I mean the word "destiny?" Do I mean that the exact state of the world ten or fifty or one hundred years from now is inevitable, down to the last detail? No, on two counts.</p>
<p>(i) I'm talking not about the world's exact, detailed state, but about its broad contours: the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of its political and economic structures (Whither, for example, the nation-state?); the texture of individual experience (Whither freedom?); the scope of culture (Whither Mickey Mouse?); and so on.</p>
<p>(2) I'm not talking about something that is literally inevitable. Still, I am talking about something whose chances of transpiring are very, very high. Moreover, I'm saying that the only real alternatives to the "destiny" that I'll outline are extremely unpleasant, best avoided for all our sakes.</p>
<p>Some people may consider it cheating to use the word "destiny" when you mean not "inevitable" but "exceedingly likely." Would you consider it cheating to say that the destiny of a poppy seed is to become a poppy? Obviously, a given poppy seed may not become a poppy. Indeed, the destiny of some poppy seeds seems--in retrospect, at least--to have been getting baked onto a bagel. And even poppy seeds that have escaped this <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a>, and landed on soil, may still get eaten (though not at brunch) and thus never become flowers.</p>
<p>Still, there are at least three <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that it seems defensible to say that the "destiny" of a poppy seed is to become a poppy. First, this is very likely to happen under broadly definable circumstances. Second, from the seed's point of view, the only alternative to this happening is catastrophe--<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, to put a finer point on it. Third, if we inspect the essence of a poppy seed--the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> it contains--we find it hard to escape the conclusion that the poppy seed is <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to become a poppy. Indeed, you might say the seed is designed to become a poppy even though it was "designed" not by a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> designer, but by natural selection. For anything other than full-fledged poppyhood to happen to a poppy seed--for it to get baked onto a bagel or eaten by a bird--is for the seed's true <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> to be stifled, its naturally imbued purpose to go unrealized.</p>
<p>It is for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s roughly <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to these that I will make an argument for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> destiny. Of course, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-poppy <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> gets most <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious when we ponder the third <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>: Is it fair to say that our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> has some larger "purpose?" Is there some grand goal that <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> was "designed" to realize? Here, as I've said, the argument has to get quite speculative. But I do think the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for answering yes are stronger than many people--especially many scientists and social scientists--realize.</p><h1>THE CURRENT <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">CHAOS</a></h1><p>Neither <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> nor <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is a smooth, steady process. Both pass through thresholds; they can leap from one equilibrium to a new, higher-level equilibrium. To some people, the current era has the aura of a threshold; it has that unsettling, out-of-control feeling that can portend a major shift. Technological, geopolitical, and economic change seem ominously fast, and the fabric of society seems somehow tenuous.</p>
<p>For instance: World currency markets are rocked by the turbulent force of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally lubricated financial speculation. Weapons of mass destruction are cultivated by rogue regimes and New Age cults. Nations seem less cohesive than before, afflicted by ethnic or religious or cultural faction. Health officials seriously discuss the prospect of a worldwide plague--the unspeakably gruesome Ebola <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, perhaps, or some microbe we don't yet know about, spread around the world by jet-propelled travelers. Even tropical storms seem to have grown more intense in recent decades, arguably a result of <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>.</p>
<p>It sounds apocalyptic, and some religiously minded people think it literally is. They have trouble imagining that this rash of new threats could be mere coincidence-especially coming, as it has, at the end of a millennium. Some fundamentalist Christians cite growing global <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> as evidence that Judgment Day is around the corner. A whole genre of best-selling novels envisions "the Rapture," the day when true believers, on the way to heaven, meet Christ in midair, while others, down below, find a less glamorous <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, these fundamentalists are right. No, I don't mean about the Rapture. I just mean that growing turmoil does signify, by my lights, a distinct step in the unfolding of what you could call the world's destiny. We are indeed approaching a culmination of sorts; our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> seems to face a kind of test toward which <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> forces of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> have been moving us for millennia. It is a test of political imagination--of our ability to accept <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a>, necessary changes in structures of governance--but also a test of moral imagination.</p>
<p>So how will we do on this test? Judging by <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, the current turbulence will eventually yield to an era of relative stability, an era when global political, economic, and social structures have largely tamed the new forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. The world will reach a new equilibrium, at a level of organization higher than any past equilibrium. And the period we are now entering will, in retrospect, look like the storm before the calm.</p>
<p>Or, on the other hand, we could blow up the world. Remember, even poppy seeds don't always manage to flower.</p>
<p>For that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, even if we avoid blowing up the world, <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of uncertainty remain. Though the natural <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> has certain firm parameters, they leave some leeway. One can imagine, within the bounds of possibility suggested by the trajectory of the past, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> political structures that grant more freedom or less, more privacy or less, that foster more <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> or less, more wealth or less.</p>
<p>One purpose of this book [<i>Nonzero</i>] is to aid in exploring this "wiggle room"--in choosing among such alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s and in realizing the choice. But at least as important as using destiny's leeway wisely is easing destiny's arrival. <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a>, even if its <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> direction is <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>, can proceed at massive, wrenching <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cost. Or it can proceed more smoothly--with costs, to be sure, but with more tolerable costs. It is the destiny of our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>--and this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I mean the inescapable destiny, not just the high likelihood--to choose.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>There are other alternatives to "blowing up the world" or "continuing the cycles of turbulence and calm". To attempt to guide ourselves through the turbulence to the next calm (so as to avoid blowing up the world) may not be the best strategy.
<br>
<br>
Humanity may be still embryonic, the Era of Civilizations being but a preliminary stage in the emergence of life/mind beyond the "flatlands"  of the physical/biological.
<br>
<br>
That Life and Creativity are late emergents in an exploding physical universe may be but one of a complementarity of alternative perspectives. Can we explore parity for the triad: Material, Mental, Media or Marks. ALL of our "knowledge" references perceived/interpreted patterns (TEXTS).
<br>
<br>
SCIENCE is today limited to the study of transformations. Emergence (where form appears where there was no prior form to be transformed - but a chaotic substrate exists) has yet to be comprehended scientifically.  There is, as yet, no science of emergent origins.  Yet, we may be at the threshold of a major emergence - a "synergistic eruption" (as much "positive" as nuclear winter is "negative").
<br>
<br>
Zero-Sum is one of the retrospective principles of history, I agree. What deterimines the "success/outcome" of the game?
<br>
<br>
Our coming Singularity may not be a takeover by Artifical Intelligence - but the emergence of AUGMENTED INTELLIGENCE, where human organizing bootstraps beyond our wildest imagination.
<br>
<br>
Greatly increased turbulence is in our destiny. What seeds can we plant and nurture to insure appropriate initial conditions for the next emergence out of chaos? </p></td>
