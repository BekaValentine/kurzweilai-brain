<div class="TeaserText">In an evolutionary process, positive feedback increases order exponentially. A correlate is that the "returns" of an evolutionary process (such as the speed, cost-effectiveness, or overall "power" of a process) increase exponentially over time -- both for biology and technology. Ray Kurzweil submitted on essay based on that premise to Edge.org in response to John Brockman's question: "What's your law?"</div>

              and KurzweilAI.net Jan. 12, 2003</i></p>
<p><li> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> applies positive feedback in that the more capable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s resulting from one stage of evolutionary <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> are used 
              to create the next stage.&#160; Each epoch of evolution has progressed 
              more rapidly by building on the products of the previous stage.&#160; 
            <p></p>
<p><li> Evolution works through indirection: evolution 
              created humans, humans created <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, humans are now working 
              with increasingly advanced technology to create new generations 
              of technology.&#160; As a result, the rate of progress of an evolutionary 
              process increases exponentially over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> Over time, the "<a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>" of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> embedded 
              in the evolutionary process (i.e., the measure of how well the information 
              fits a purpose, which in evolution is survival) increases.&#160; <p></p>
<p><b>A comment on the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of order.&#160; </b>The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the "order" 
              of information is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant here, as it is not the same as the opposite 
              of disorder.&#160; If disorder represents a random sequence of events, 
              then the opposite of disorder should imply "not random."&#160; Information 
              is a sequence of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that is meaningful in a process, such as the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>, or the bits in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">Noise</a>, 
              on the other hand, is a random sequence.&#160; Neither noise nor information 
              is predictable.&#160; Noise is inherently unpredictable, but carries 
              no information.&#160; Information, however, is also unpredictable.&#160; If 
              we can predict <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> data from past data, then that future data 
              stops being information.&#160; We might consider an alternating <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              ("0101010. . . .") to be orderly, but it carries no information 
              (beyond the first couple of bits).&#160; </p>
<p>Thus orderliness does not constitute order because order requires 
              information.&#160; However, order goes beyond mere information.&#160; A recording 
              of radiation levels from <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> represents information, but if we 
              double the size of this data file, we have increased the amount 
              of data, but we have not achieved a deeper level of order.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Order is information that fits a purpose</i>.&#160; The measure of 
              order is the measure of how well the information fits the purpose.&#160; 
              In the evolution of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-forms, the purpose is to survive.&#160; In an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a> (a computer program that simulates evolution 
              to solve a problem) applied to, say, investing in the stock market, 
              the purpose is to make money.&#160; Simply having more information does 
              not necessarily result in a better fit.&#160; A superior solution for 
              a purpose may very well involve less data.</p>
<p>The concept of "<a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>" is often used to describe the nature 
              of the information created by an evolutionary process.&#160; Complexity 
              is a close fit to the concept of order that I am describing, but 
              is also not sufficient.&#160; Sometimes, a deeper order &#8211; a better fit 
              to a purpose &#8211; is achieved through simplification rather than further 
              increases in complexity.&#160; For example, a new theory that ties together 
              apparently disparate ideas into one broader more coherent theory 
              reduces complexity but nonetheless may increase the "order for a 
              purpose" that I am describing.&#160; Indeed, achieving simpler theories 
              is a driving force in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.&#160; Evolution has shown, however, that 
              the general trend towards greater order does generally result in 
              greater complexity.</p>
<p>Thus improving a solution to a problem &#8211; which may increase or 
              decrease complexity &#8211; increases order.&#160; Now that just leaves the 
              issue of defining the problem.&#160; Indeed, the key to an evolution 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> (and to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and technological evolution) is exactly 
              this: defining the problem.&#160; </p>
<p>We may note that this aspect of "Kurzweil's Law" (the law of accelerating 
              returns) appears to contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics, 
              which implies that <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> (randomness in a <a class="thought" href="entries/closed_system_entry.html">closed system</a>) cannot 
              decrease, and, therefore, generally increases.&#160; However, the law 
              of accelerating returns pertains to evolution, and evolution is 
              not a closed system.&#160; It takes place amidst great <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, and indeed 
              depends on the disorder in its midst, from which it draws its options 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>.&#160; And from these options, an evolutionary process 
              continually prunes its choices to create ever greater order.&#160; Even 
              a crisis, such as the periodic large asteroids that have crashed 
              into the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, although increasing chaos temporarily, end up increasing 
              &#8211; deepening &#8211; the order created by an evolutionary process.&#160; </p>
<p><li> A primary <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that evolution &#8211; of life-forms 
              or of technology &#8211; speeds up is that it builds on its own increasing 
              order, with ever more sophisticated means of recording and manipulating 
              information.&#160; Innovations created by evolution encourage and enable 
              faster evolution.&#160; In the case of the evolution of life forms, the 
              most notable early example is DNA, which provides a recorded and 
              protected transcription of life's design from which to launch further 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s.&#160; In the case of the evolution of technology, ever improving 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> methods of recording information have fostered further technology.&#160; 
              The first computers were designed on paper and assembled by hand.&#160; 
              Today, they are designed on computer workstations with the computers 
              themselves working out many details of the next generation's design, 
              and are then produced in fully-automated factories with human guidance 
              but limited direct intervention.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> The evolutionary process of technology seeks 
              to improve capabilities in an exponential fashion.&#160; Innovators seek 
              to improve things by multiples.&#160; Innovation is multiplicative, not 
              additive.&#160; Technology, like any evolutionary process, builds on 
              itself.&#160; This aspect will continue to accelerate when the technology 
              itself takes full control of its own progression.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> We can thus conclude the following with regard 
              to the evolution of life-forms, and of technology:&#160; the law of accelerating 
              returns as applied to an evolutionary process: An evolutionary process 
              is not a closed system; therefore, evolution draws upon the chaos 
              in the larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in which it takes place for its options for 
              diversity; and evolution builds on its own increasing order.&#160; Therefore, 
              in an evolutionary process, order increases exponentially.<p></p>
<p><li> A correlate of the above observation is that 
              the "returns" of an evolutionary process (e.g., the speed, cost-effectiveness, 
              or overall "power" of a process) increase exponentially over time.&#160; 
              We see this in <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>, in which each new generation of computer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> (now spaced about two years apart) provides twice as many <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, 
              each of which operates substantially faster (because of the smaller 
              distances required for the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s to travel, and other innovations).&#160; 
              This <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in the power and <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of information-based 
              technologies &#8211; now roughly doubling every year &#8211; is not limited 
              to computers, but is true for a wide range of technologies, measured 
              many different ways.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> In another positive feedback loop, as a particular 
              evolutionary process (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>) becomes more effective 
              (e.g., cost effective), greater resources are deployed towards the 
              further progress of that process.&#160; This results in a second level 
              of exponential growth (i.e., the rate of exponential growth itself 
              grows exponentially).&#160; For example, it took three years to double 
              the price-performance of computation at the beginning of the twentieth 
              century, two years around 1950, and is now doubling about once a 
              year.&#160; Not only is each chip doubling in power each year for the 
              same unit cost, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of chips being manufactured is growing 
              exponentially.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> Biological evolution is one such evolutionary 
              process.&#160; Indeed it is the quintessential evolutionary process.&#160; 
              It took place in a completely open system (as opposed to the artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s in an evolutionary algorithm).&#160; Thus many levels of 
              the system evolved at the same time.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> Technological evolution is another such evolutionary 
              process.&#160; Indeed, the emergence of the first technology-creating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> resulted in the new evolutionary process of technology.&#160; 
              Therefore, technological evolution is an outgrowth of &#8211; and a continuation 
              of&#160; &#8211;&#160; biological evolution.&#160;&#160; Early stages of <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> created 
              technology were barely faster than the biological evolution that 
              created our species.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> evolved in a few hundred thousand 
              years.&#160; Early stages of technology &#8211; the wheel, fire, stone tools 
              &#8211; took tens of thousands of years to evolve and be widely deployed.&#160; 
              A thousand years ago, a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> such as the printing press, 
              took on the order of a century to be widely deployed.&#160; Today, major 
              paradigm shifts, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones and the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">world wide web</a> were 
              widely adopted in only a few years time.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> A specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> (a method or approach to 
              solving a problem, e.g., shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> as an approach to making more powerful computers) provides 
              exponential growth until the method exhausts its potential.&#160; When 
              this happens, a paradigm shift (a fundamental change in the approach) 
              occurs, which enables exponential growth to continue. <p></p>
<p><li> Each paradigm follows an "S-curve," which consists 
              of slow <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> (the early phase of exponential growth), followed 
              by rapid growth (the late, explosive phase of exponential growth), 
              followed by a leveling off as the particular paradigm matures.&#160; 
            <p></p>
<p><li> During this third or maturing phase in the 
              life cycle of a paradigm, pressure builds for the next paradigm 
              shift, and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> dollars are invested to create the next paradigm.&#160; 
              We can see this in the enormous investments being made today in 
              the next computing paradigm &#8211; three-dimensional molecular computing 
              &#8211; despite the fact that we still have at least a decade left for 
              the paradigm of shrinking transistors on a flat <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> 
              using photolithography (Moore's Law).&#160; Generally, by the time a 
              paradigm approaches its asymptote (limit) in price-performance, 
              the next technical paradigm is already working in niche applications.&#160; 
              For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers were shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s in the 1950s 
              to provide greater price-performance for computers, and reached 
              a point where it was no longer feasible to shrink tubes and maintain 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>.&#160; At this point, around 1960, transistors had already achieved 
              a strong niche market in portable radios.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> When a paradigm shift occurs for a particular 
              type of technology, the process begins a new S-curve.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> Thus the acceleration of the overall evolutionary 
              process proceeds as a sequence of S-curves, and the overall exponential 
              growth consists of this cascade of S-curves.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> The resources underlying the exponential growth 
              of an evolutionary process are relatively unbounded.<p></p>
<p><li> One resource is the (ever-growing) order of 
              the evolutionary process itself.&#160; Each stage of evolution provides 
              more powerful tools for the next.&#160; In biological evolution, the 
              advent of DNA allowed more powerful and faster evolutionary "experiments."&#160; 
              Later, setting the "designs" of <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> body plans during the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> 
              explosion allowed rapid evolutionary development of other body organs, 
              such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#160; Or to take a more recent example, the advent 
              of computer-assisted design tools allows rapid development of the 
              next generation of computers.<p></p>
<p><li> The other required resource is the "chaos" 
              of the environment in which the evolutionary process takes place 
              and which provides the options for further diversity.&#160; In biological 
              evolution, diversity enters the process in the form of mutations 
              and ever- changing environmental conditions.&#160; In technological evolution, 
              human ingenuity combined with ever-changing market conditions keep 
              the process of innovation going.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> If we apply these principles at the highest 
              level of evolution on Earth, the first step, the creation of cells, 
              introduced the paradigm of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>.&#160; The subsequent emergence of 
              DNA provided a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> method to record the results of evolutionary 
              experiments.&#160; Then, the evolution of a species that combined rational 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> with an opposable appendage (the thumb) caused a fundamental 
              paradigm shift from biology to technology.&#160; The upcoming primary 
              paradigm shift will be from biological <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> to a hybrid combining 
              biological and <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> thinking.&#160; This hybrid will include 
              "biologically inspired" processes resulting from the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              of biological brains. <p></p>
<p><li> If we examine the timing of these steps, we 
              see that the process has continuously accelerated.&#160; The evolution 
              of life forms required billions of years for the first steps (e.g., 
              primitive cells); later on progress accelerated.&#160; During the Cambrian 
              explosion, major paradigm shifts took only tens of millions of years.&#160; 
              Later on, Humanoids developed over a period of millions of years, 
              and Homo sapiens over a period of only hundreds of thousands of 
              years.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> With the advent of a technology-creating species, 
              the exponential pace became too fast for evolution through DNA-guided 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> and moved on to human-created technology.&#160; Technology 
              goes beyond mere tool making; it is a process of creating ever more 
              powerful technology using the tools from the previous round of innovation, 
              and is, thereby, an evolutionary process.&#160; As I noted, the first 
              technological took tens of thousands of years.&#160; For people living 
              in this era, there was little noticeable technological change in 
              even a thousand years.&#160; By 1000 AD, progress was much faster and 
              a paradigm shift required only a century or two.&#160; In the nineteenth 
              century, we saw more technological change than in the nine centuries 
              preceding it.&#160; Then in the first twenty years of the twentieth century, 
              we saw more advancement than in all of the nineteenth century.&#160; 
              Now, paradigm shifts occur in only a few years time.&#160; <p></p>
<p><li> The paradigm shift rate (i.e., the overall 
              rate of technical progress) is currently doubling (approximately) 
              every decade; that is, paradigm shift times are halving every decade 
              (and the rate of acceleration is itself growing exponentially).&#160; 
              So, the technological progress in the twenty-first century will 
              be equivalent to what would require (in the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> view) on the 
              order of 200 centuries.&#160; In contrast, the twentieth century saw 
              only about 20 years of progress (again at today's rate of progress) 
              since we have been speeding up to current rates.&#160; So the twenty-first 
              century will see about a thousand times greater technological change 
              than its predecessor.&#160; <p></p>

<br>
<br>
The replication of DNA pre-exists the cellular envelope.  Most DNA in the biosphere exists outside such an envelope.  This primitive form of life is the greater fraction of the flesh of Gaia.
<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt; ... record the results ... &lt;/quote&gt;
<br>
It is possible that new protein codes are written to the gamete directly, but it so an as yet unperceived mechanism is involved.  It is possible that the amino-acid liquid crystal closely adherent of the DNA and within which mRNA moves, is itself cognitive.  If so, it could be that this entity uses the DNA to record successful protein designs, but that is capable of creative problem solving.  If so, it is possible that a successful strategy is recorded and a 'courier' cell produced which physically moves to the gamete generator whereat the new information is thereafter included in the gametic haploid.
<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;
<br>
... the exponential pace became too fast for evolution through DNA-guided protein synthesis and moved on to human-created technology ...
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<br>
You imply that the evolution of life and machines are mutually displacive?  I can't believe you mean that.  Life-forms evolve whether man's machines exist or not.  Is the 'exponential pace' an entity?

<br>
&lt;quote&gt;
<br>
<br>
The term 'better' is subjective. If by better you mean faster then we already have that form of genetic change, its called radiation poisoning. The oldest form of genetic variation is damage to the genetic material. There is a school of thought that most of the major genetic changes in all 'natural' genoms have been produced by viral and bactirialogical gene sharing.
<br>
<br>
Your hole assumption is that at some point an old development becomes useless. The fact is that newer developments just make the older developments less dominant. An example of this is in spite of the computer being the fastest technology for information trasmission through time we still use pens, pencils, quills, brushes and charcoal. The reason for this is that they remain the best tool for the job.
<br>
<br>
The reality is some areas the ability to completely control a given genom will be useful but it will not do away with 'natral' genoms.</p></td>

Kurzweil recognizes that particular technology trends go in S curves - slow start, rapid growth, slow finish (as other technologies surpass it).
<br>
<br>
I wonder why he doesn't seem to raise the idea of an S-curve of S-curves, but assumes we'll hit a singularity and just head off the graph?
<br>
<br>
Instead, we might be somewhere in the middle of an S-curve of S-curves - new science and technology coming fast and furious, but eventually slowing.  
<br>
<br>
The fact that there is common belief abroad that we're near a singularity might be taken to imply that we're actually approaching the middle of the SCoSC - which will look a lot like a singularity (unpredictably different from today) but technologically would represent the point where new technology introductions start to come slower.   
<br>
<br>
The difference?   Depends on how close we are, and how steep the SCoSC is and how long we stay "in the middle" - we might emerge recognizably human, or nearly extinct and replaced by AI mind children, or somewhere in between.

It seems very likely that all improving trends and even trends of trends eventually hit limits and form an S-curve.  Most tech trends have a long way to go - but some appear to be well past their steepest rate of improvement - e.g. terrestrial transportation technologies.
<br>
<br>
If the singularity truly is an exponential increase in intelligence and capability, it goes to infinity as it approaches some date.  But that also means that it never emerges on the other side of that date, which is a limit to on-going progress in itself!
<br>
<br>
For example, maybe the human race will compress into a sphere of sentient neutronium and live out the rest of its existence - maybe billions of subjective years - before the end of the 21st century of realtime, and then simply vanish - extinct.

Rather, it's plausible that *all* trends eventually end, including that of an S-curve, - we're talking about properties of an environment,
<br>
of which we probably know an infinitesimal part.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Im glad Ray brought up the issue with the evolutionary algorithm.  He says that the key is defining the problem.  I think if the singularity is going to be a product of an EA then we still have alot of work in defining problems for the EA to solve.  Unless of course some kind of powerful intelligence can be applied which can reason and solve the definitions, but for now we have to do the hard work.
<br>
<br>
Also Ray says
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Biological evolution is one such evolutionary process.  Indeed it is the quintessential evolutionary process.  It took place in a completely open system (as opposed to the artificial constraints in an evolutionary algorithm).  Thus many levels of the system evolved at the same time. </p></center>
<br>
This too i feel is important.  The idea that the EA can only be based in a simulation of the environment. The artificial constraints of a simulation will always limit the growth of EA i think.  We can always keep updating the simulation but this too is alot of hard work which is based on our scientific findings (for example in building a neural net involves describing neural functioning- which we have limited knowledge on) that seems outside the ability of EA plus Computer power alone.
<br>
<br>
I guess the BIG question will be, 'will we have enough information for the simulation and definitions of problems so that EA can spark the big S within 20 years?'
<br>
<br>
In either case i feel that EA's will continue to play an important part in furthering our knowledge at least for narrow functions...</p></td>

That complexity is defined as the length of the shortest descriptive program &amp; the purpose is simple record compression. The problem is that the description language is not included in the definition &amp; length of computation is ignored. For Ray (&amp; for me) order is not simply compressability but environmental correspondence/predictiveness, the difference being that it shouldn't depend on the method of encoding/description. </p></td>

<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; length of computation is ignored. 
<br>
&gt; It's true for the original studies. But other people study the computational requirements now. For example look up Juergen Schmidhuber work. 
<br>
<br>
Right, I did look at it before, but it didn't make much sense to me,- he concentrates on computation but ignores record compression, I think there should be a common denominator between the two,- indicating overall "cost".
<br>
But it's a secondary issue.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; being that it shouldn't depend on the method of encoding/description. 
<br>
<br>
&gt; It does not except for a constant factor. Like in integration. Integral of x is 0.5*x^2 + CONST. The presence of the indefined CONST does not invalidate the 0.5*x^2 part. 
<br>
<br>
By encoding I mean not only procedural language but also previous compression of the data set, which would reduce compressabilty but should not, theoretically, affect predictability. The simpliest example is digitization,- variables encoded as binary digits will be less compressible than those encoded as decimal digits.
<br>
<br>
There must be encoding-neutral way to quantify similarity, initially between two inputs, which would also indicate predictability of subsequent inputs.  
<br>
<br>
&gt; As for predictiveness, it's not so simple. Here is an example sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8. What's next? 10? Wrong. It's 34 because the sequence is 
<br>
n^4-10n^3+35n^2-48n+24 :-) (c) Schmidhuber 
<br>
<br>
It's actually both, but can you quantify which pattern is stronger? :)

Also, my previous post was misleading, my real problem with compression as a measure of match is that it's asymmetrical. Given two comparands A &amp; B,

the simplest compression by subtraction can be either A - mod(B-A), or B - mod(A-B), which are likely to be different. Obviously, a match is what's common between the comparands, so it shouldn't depend on the direction.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&lt;p&gt;I think there is a mixup between complexity and compressibility. Kolmogorov complexity and compressibility as in WinZip are not the same. For example take number PI (3.14159...). Its Kolmogorov complexity is very low because the program which calculates PI is short. On the other hand the numeric representation of PI is uncompressible because it appear random.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>
&lt;p&gt;As for the example with sequence, the simplicity of one explanation vs the complexity of the other is relative. It's possible to construct a space where the complex formula would appear simple.&lt;/p&gt;</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&lt;p&gt;I think there is a mixup between complexity and compressibility. Kolmogorov complexity and compressibility as in WinZip are not the same. For example take number PI (3.14159...). Its Kolmogorov complexity is very low because the program which calculates PI is short. On the other hand the numeric representation of PI is uncompressible because it appear random.&lt;/p&gt; 
<br>
<br>
PI is a single variable, it's only represented by a sequence of digits for compression on the first place. It's length is not complexity but precision. Intra-variable inter-digit compression is usually unproductive, it doesn't operate in spatio-temporal continuum.  
<br>
<br>
&lt;p&gt;As for the example with sequence, the simplicity of one explanation vs the complexity of the other is relative. It's possible to construct a space where the complex formula would appear simple.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>
<br>
Except that you have to include the definition of that space, which would put that formula back to where it belongs. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>IMHO, Ray Kurzweil makes the same common mistake that most forecasters make.  That is, taking a trend or pattern seen in some slice of data to its extreme conclusion.  He attempts to avert us from seeing this by explaining that paradigm shifts allow continued evolutionary processes to accelerate on a roughly exponential curve when one views progress with historical perspective.  He concludes that this will continue indefinitely and eventually to a singularity.   He is bold enough to call this a law - the Law of Accelerating Returns.   
<br>
<br>
What does a singularity even mean in this context? You can't make sense of such a thing - it is a paradox by itself.   Laws break down at a singularity.  They are undefined by definition.  They cannot be described because they cannot ever truly be reached.   
<br>
<br>
But how does he conclude, given the subjective nature of the quantities attached to progress, that this exponential curve is asymptotic?  Can he predict with this curve the approximate timeframe the singularity may be reached?  Instead could it not continue infinitely without reaching a limit?  Or could it be part of an S-curve itself?  Might there be other forces at work that will cause this curve to flatten out or even ultimately be limited by a horizontal asymptote?  Perhaps the curve when inspected closely is not smooth at all and contains hills and valleys of significant magnitudes.  Couldn't there be a hiccup or two in the evolutionary process?  I think if you evaluated the past honestly you would see many of these hiccups in history.  How do we know we're not heading for one right now? 
<br>
<br>
IMHO, there are way too many unknowns to make a prediction like he does, let alone claim it to be a law.  
<br>
Many other possibilities could happen.  Its possible, for instance, that we (human race) will not see and correct the folly of our cancerous growth and consumption of the Earth's resources early enough to avert disaster.  Its possible that this could throw us back 100's of years requiring us to rebuild up to the advanced level of technology we enjoy today but in sustainable ways.  Its possible that we will enter space and embark on colonizing Mars, mining asteroids, and other space exploration and colonization.  These activities, although technologically advanced, would put us back into a physical frontier where we just don't have the luxury of chasing surreal disembodied AI or virtual environments, having to use our ingenuity to survive instead.  Its possible that some of the imagined technology is simply not feasible at all.  Its possible that an asteroid will wipe out life on the earth as we know it (again).  One could go on and on.
<br>
<br>
Back to the topic.  So what would make the evolutionary process an S-curve?  I have an idea.  I call it the Law of Limiting Intelligent Knowledge Absorption.  It applies only to technological evolution.  It states that as knowledge increases the ability to absorb and apply that knowledge (needed for continued evolutionary progress) by intelligent sentient beings reaches a threshold associated with natural limitations inherent in the current physical embodiment and context of said intelligence.   This acts as an opposing force to the law of accelerating returns.   
<br>
<br>
I believe we are reaching this threshold in our current human form, our brains, human nature, our societies, policies, law and environmental disposition.  And due to this, it will require a much longer time than Ray imagines- if at all - to move from our constraining biological form to new forms that can continue the exponential potential of evolutionary progress in a new S-curve.  During this time, technological progress will continue, but not at the exponential rates required to create the technology and societal changes outlined by Ray in his books by the mid to late 21st century.   I believe that due to this growth slowdown he underestimates the difficulty in attaining the kinds of technology and associated societal changes he describes.   This is my optimistic outlook.  Ray's is certainly fanciful and imaginative, but I don't believe immortality is just around the corner.

I suppose there is no guarantee that either of those 2 will happen.  But if we can control intelligence, then we've crossed into new territory.  Then Kurzweil's law really kicks in. Intelligence creates increasing intelligence.

It took the universe billions of years to evolve to life.  But once life was created, at least on this planet, it took off. Similarly, it took life a long time to evolve to intelligence. If Kurzweil is correct, then we may be getting close to the launching point.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
As long as we're still human flesh and blood, we still must be born and raised and educated to the current level of common knowledge.  Individuals still need to specialize in order to get to the leading edge of a field.  This still requires 20-40 years per individual to do.  Ethics and politics, law and order still control society.  Societal norms do not change at evolutionary speeds like technology does.  Technology requires huge amounts of capital and natural resources.  What I am saying is these inherent factors related to our current physical reality and environmental/social context are beginning to limit the evolutionary growth themselves.
<br>
<br>
Try to imagine exponential technological progress resulting in these new paradigms on the order of every year, month, week, day, or hour?  It is not possible given our current form and physical reality.  Generations of people are required for massive changes.  My thought is we are just now or just have started reaching the point where these factors are making a difference and slowing down paradigm shifts.  Also that if we "move" to a new form of intelligence that it will have similar limitations inherent within it but on a different level.
<br>
<br>
Assume for the moment in the next 30 years, the technology for brain scanning and emulation is achieved to the degree needed to copy an intelligence to a computer.  What would happen? There would be much debate over the ethics involved and there would be as many or more people that would simply flat out reject the idea of being instantiated in a computer as much as accept it.  Laws may restrict its use.  The rich early adopters would be needed to begin building the infrastructure needed to make it a common available option.  How long would this take?  Would masses of people accept it ever? Where will the raw materials needed for millions and billions of new sentient beings come from?  How would this help the human condition and the planet?
<br>
<br>
Personally, I tend to think that a more likely evolutionary scenario is that we over time slowly integrate technology and biology into an evolving humankind that will for 100s if not 1000s of years still bear resemblance to our DNA based roots (like you can find vestiges of DOS in Windows XP code).  This is commonly referred to as the post-human or trans-human movement.  We will be forced to explore space/colonize other planets so we can continue our population growth and resource utilization (its all just a big pyramid scheme ;-))  This seems a much more realistic prediction than that of a an un-explainable singularity...

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Dear Matt
<br>
Evolution IS exponential.  I know what you mean with stagnation:  Why has there been a standstill of 1000 years in the Midle ages.  The hellenistic civilization was only a few hundred years away from its industrial revolution, as we were at the beginning of the renaissance, why has it stopped.  Even much earlier: The brain of stenonychosaurus could learn as fast as that of a ramapithecus.  Who knows how close some creatures living just before the Permian mass extinction were to hominide intelligence? There have been many general s-curves in the history of evolution.  But why?
<br>
Because (don't laugh) an exponential curve in the natural world is different from a mathetical one: unforseen shit can happen.  The curve in the cretacious was so extremely flat that a big asteroid had time enough to strike.  No dinosauroid was enough developed to go in space and prevent it from happening.  
<br>
A big asteroid strikes once in 100 million years. So it must happen in this century, or we blow it out of the sky.  The chance that this happens is so small, that I don't think, Matt, that you can't integrate this event in your evolutionary model.  
<br>
Why has technological evolution slowed down after the golden age of hellenism?  Because only a comparatively minor military conflict or a famine was enough to unbalance a dawning civilization.  Nowadays, it takes a lot more to create such a general s-curve.  You would reply: But the ability to unbalance civilization has also evolved.
<br>
I know. We have enough nuclear weapons to destroy us, but will we do it?  So many years of cold war didn't lead to global destruction, the amount of nuclear weapons will be reduced to zero in a few decenia.  North Korea can launch only a few rockets, whereafter it would be immediately and totally destroyed.
<br>
<br>
So If the evolution of technolgy will slow down, it won't be due to meteors or nukes.
<br>
<br>
I believe mankind in general has become a lot wiser than 1000 years ago when a certain pope ordered a theological scolar to calculate how mant angels could fit on a pin's head. This is no joke!  We have the wisdom to handle dangerous technologies.  Accidents will happen, but on a global scale they will be minor nuisances.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Face it:  Two thousand years ago, a delay lasted 1000 years, now a delay lasts 10 years.  The singularity will happen in this century and we will have to face it.
<br>

About the exponentiality: If nothing unforeseen would happen (fall of the roman empire, the planetary collision at the end of the cretacious,..., we would look at a smooth exponential curve.
<br>
<br>
Ray Kurzweil once said (I think) that when the curve of evolution enters the bent of the knee (just before it goes up rapidly.  This started at the dawn of the industrial revolution), there's virtually nothing that can stop it.  Everyone sees how much the world has changed in the last two hundred years.

Thetime needed for an increase in knowledge and complexity from Leonardo da vinci's models to a stealth bomber is 500 years.  The same progress will be witnessed in only 20 years.  Believe me everything will go bananas very soon.  And if things go wrong, it will at least be interesting.</p></td>

BTW, a singularity in the mathematical sense can only be reached when there is an approaching limit in the function.  What I am asking about the exponential growth is not whether it is exponential but whether it is asymptotic and therefore approaches a limit and therefore a singularity.  I don't think the data is good enough to predict this.  The singularity in Ray's predictions is perhaps a misnomer.  He just means when the evolutionary progress reaches a certain mystical threshold of steepness. But getting back to my question.  Describe the singularity - what does it really mean? what does it imply for the human race or sentient race that reaches it? what does it imply for the universe? Can you really put any meaning to such a thing? Rules break down at a singularity.  I don't believe it will come.

<br>
What kind of meaning are you looking for- shit happens- is that good enough?  How about- continuation of technological growth at a faster and faster rate that is well documented with Moores Law as well as all the other paridigms behind itsuch as vacuum tube computer and transistor machines- its quite easy to see that this is likely to continue for some time with the predicted 3d chips using nanotubes etc.  As for the limit thing you mentioned earlier, i have not read anything describing a limit on technological growth once the singularity is ignited.  The only limit Ray describes is the limit imposed by a limit of matter and energy availiable- im not sure if this restricts technological evolution- i dont really care at this point either.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> what does it imply for the human race or sentient race that reaches it? </p></center>
<br>
again, i dont know what you are seeking here... read the Kurzweil stuff all over this forum and critise whatever you feel is wrong or produced a false implication or lack of one...  It seems clear to me that it implies a merge between human and computer tech/nanotech, upgrading ourselves... you know post human-post post human etc.  Ray makes it clear that our human quality is maintained, that is our emotions, consciousness etc i guess...
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> what does it imply for the universe? </p></center>
<br>
saturation of intelligence-there an essay on this read that first...
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Can you really put any meaning to such a thing? Rules break down at a singularity. I don't believe it will come. </p></center>   What meaning, you mean like a meaning of life or something?  Do you have a meaning, a purpose?  Ray bases his predictions of what he observes from the facts of exponential growth, how does this break down Laws of the universe, but dont tell me, point this out to subtillion who knows the universe like its his left hand, if he says its not feasible then i'll agree with you then...

<br>
I think you mean that if the universe is infinate then the intelligent pico or programmable matter based technology (what ever we will be using) can not expand out into the infinate expanse of the entire universe and thus never be absolutely saurated.  Ok i can agree with this.  Maybe there are some places the pico tech colud not go eg heart of a sun.  I have no idea.  What does seem reasonable to me is that nano tech is possible and if the following femto and pico tech are also possible (i have no idea- but if technology is to continue evolving as SUB suggests then there will certainly been further technical paridigms following nanotech etc).  What ever technology they turn out to be we will probably be able to manipulate 'dumb matter' in dfferent ways, even making more pico tech etc.  As normal matter becomes intelligent in this way we are in the process of saturating the universe with intelligence.  THIS PROCESS has already began and has done for millions of years on this plant, its called BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION.  Your brain is made up of MATTER and is organised in a way that equals intellignce!
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> -If the evolutionary curve steepness is infinite time will have stopped in the instant the singularity is reached in a race to fill the infinite universe with a infinite intelligence. </p></center>
<br>
We only perceive the technology evolution as infinate at the point described as the singularity.  When we get there we are likely to understand and be able to predict the tech evolution as our perception will also evolve.
<br>
Ultimately im not sure if we will contiue to evolve technology and intelligence (which will be strongly related and in a sense is today) FOR EVER.  Sub says that it will continue to evolve beyond the so called singularity (which is just a point in the future which has no real significance). 
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> -If the universe is finite, but the evolutionary progress is, it will be instantaneously saturated and ended at same moment. 
<br>
-If the universe if finite and the curve is very very very steep but not infinite and still exponentially growing, the universe will be saturated in a very short duration of time. </p></center>
<br>
The universe is not finite.  Even if it was, and assuming this would limit evoution say beyond pico level- so what- evolution would stop- big deal- How would this end the Universe? 
<br>
<br>
Doesn't this sound like fantasy? It does to me. This is what I mean when I say meaning and logic breaks down at a singularity.

<br>
<br>
Of course one _can_ do this.  I used the wrong words.  I meant that this method invariably produces incorrect forecasts/conclusions founded on invalid premises because it doesn't factor in other forces and other eventualities.  The fact that Kurzweil's forecast is from a very wide perspective does not preclude it from falling into the same pattern.  There are other factors not being considered which will impact technology evolution regardless of whether or not anyone "sees" them now.   </p></center></p></td>

I don't think you realize that "Singularity" is just a loose metaphorical term- not a precise definition- it refers to ideas of not being able to predict or "see" beyond it- and it also refers to a synthesis of technologies "collapsing" into a single universal toolset: transhuman-AI/ nanotech and artificial matter/ bioengineering coming together to form a transendent network architecture of hyper-intelligent systems with total control over matter and spacetime so that any distinctions between the human body/ physical reality / and information-space/thought-space dissapears</p></td>

<br>
It seems from the conclusion i gather from all the post/contributions combined we can conclude that the word SINGULARITY is inadequate.  In support to Ray I think he points out that there may be a limit to Law of Accelerating returns so i dont think he intended this misconception though you are right to say that it does not help in conveying his ideas- Im gald you pointed this out- and maybe he will see this and respond or think about revising the word.

But you used Sorce theory to claim you know the universe is infinite and stated it as if it were a fact.  There is no evidence to support Sorce theory is valid over any other of the many theories, some of which theorize the universe is finite and discrete.

<br>
Now we are agreeing - that the claims are not likely valid.  Kurzweil's law of accelerating returns (actually a theory) theorizes progress will evolve exponentially _forever_.  If it does not, what will it do?  Suddenly stop from near infinite to zero?  
<br>
<br>
Probably not.  Likely the technological evolution itself will hit an S-curve.  Perhaps it may even be absolutely limited eventually.  This was one of my points in my original post. 
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> (which is just a point in the future which has no real significance). </p></center>

Exactly. That's one of the implications of part of what I've been trying to explain.

<br>
Sorce Theory is only one of MANY different theories which all can be loodely filed under the Plasma/Aether Cosmology- regardless of the distinct density details of Sorce- it still posits the overall concept that the universe is NOT a finite hyperdimensional "bubble" which emerged out of "Nothing" with voids of nothing punctuiated by matter-stuff- that logic and observation aren't lying: the universe IS Infinite- [ie extension of Existence is not- CANNOT be limited by "Nothing" at it's "frontier"] and that there are no voids: the universe emerges from a single substance of variable density- a singular Aether- and that Aether manifests mostly as a charged plasma- and that the M-M experiemts which supposedly disproved the Ether only disproved the concept of a rigid isostatic matrix- they could not predict that it could also be a superfluidic Aether- that object move WITH the Aether and not through it as the M-M experiments challenged-
<br>
Plasma/Aether models also resounding get behind Huble's partner Hilton Arp- who sanely posited that it was foolish and unscientific to accept the redshift as a result of the Doppler effect  [especially considering that falsly assuming that redder objcts are farther away leads to a plotting of galactic distrubution that forms giant finger-like clusters pointed right at US like we are at the center of everything!] when even a century later we STILL do not know even what Light IS!!! the Church of the Redshift has got to be the most unscientific and disproved "fact" in the history of Human Knowledge! 
<br>
<br>
the reason why these Plasma/Aether theories are coming on strong is mostly because of technology providing better data- especially the Hubble telescope- which is finding anomolies almost on a daily basis right now [such as connected galaxies with extreme redshift differeces- prviosly these connections were called illusions by astronemers- but Hubble 's clear images reveal unmistakable connections between objects erroneoulsy thought to be millions of light years apart]- yet with all these anomalies literally falsifying any Doppler-from-expansion interpretation of the redshift- instead of questioning the very questionable BBT/inflationary theories- the physics community just scrambles to find an epicycle- ANYTHING that they can dream up that MIGHT account for the anomoly- as soon as somone comes up with a scheme that fits the doctored math- that theory becomes like FACT in the physics community- it's worse than fundementalist religion! [a good example is the current theory about gamma-ray bursters]
<br>
<br>
another factor that are bringing the Flood are the logical impossibilities of a finite universe- Physicists have been handwaving about "Nothing" possessing quantum chaos which springs forth the universe- or that "Nothing" acts as an absolute boundy in hyperspace- but Subtillion worded the fallacy perfectly: "Either the universe is limited in extent, resolution and duration, or it is not. If you postulate that it is limited somehow then you must explain how nothingness can limit somethingness otherwise then you were never talking about the UNI-verse in the first place..."</p></td>

It is not a known fact that the universe is infinite.  You are free to believe that it is, but please don't keep claiming that you know it is for a fact.  It is just as paradoxical to think of it as infinite as it is to think of it as finite.  But this is getting off topic I think...

<br>
Actually 'transfinite' means "going beyond the finite" and seems to connote a sortof halfway position between finite and infinite, similar to the meaning of indefinite, but without the emphasis on process.  My guess is that it is used in mathematics to deal with the absurdities of infinities of different magnitudes caused by the finitude of the representational system itself.  
<br>
<br>
'Infinite' is a highly abused term and in most cases it should be substituted with the more precise terms 'transfinite' or 'indefinite', but it essentially simply means "limitless".  So it is quite applicable here (at the foundation level of ultimate UNITY) in its original meaning.</p></td>

in terms of "proving" infinity- I was thinking along the lines of the realm of physical phenomena- as oposed to Logic- in that you could never PHYSICALLY demonstrate infinity because no matter how many gogolplex-to-the-gogolplex-power-factorial gigalightyears you could "see"- you could never state with total certainty that there isn't some kind of end/boundry past the "next hill"- or in this case the next (gogolplex^gogolplex)! light years (@_@)</p></td>

<br>
please describe the paradox wrt the idea of an infinite universe as we have already given you the paradox involving a finite one, namely that it implies a duality of an active something vs. an active nothing (a complete oxymoron).
<br>
<br>
[[[ my guess is that the idea is simply uncomfortable for you (as it is to many people), but we'll see if you can articulate any real logical problems with the notion ]]]
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> But this is getting off topic I think...  </p></center>
<br>
That is the great thing about conversation, it cannot be easily contained.  If you prefer to start a new thread, then by all means do so.  If you simply choose not to further argue your claim of paradox concerning the infinite, then let the empty claim stand empty (as it has from the very beginning).  I have yet to hear any solid arguments against fundamental infinity and I would love to hear what you can articulate on the issue, even if only to further my evolving assessment of the common fallacies at play in thinking about such matters.

Ok, this stands to reason that a finite mind with finite senses and finite abstract linguistic representations cannot encompass infinity. 
<br>
<br>
Perfectly logical. no paradox so far.

<br>
You call that a paradox?  
<br>
<br>
The simple fact that you can&#8217;t prove either does not constitute a paradox.  Furthermore this so-called paradox applies equally to the fact that we cannot prove that the universe is finite.  
<br>
<br>
All you have done is stated the obvious that neither fundamental position can be proven.  As I stated earlier, we are not dealing with the realm of observation when we deal with the fundamental axiomatic assumptions upon which all science rests.  This is the realm of causal logic.  
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> If it were so obvious that the universe is infinite, why do so many very intelligent people debate about this very topic? </p></center>
<br>
Who said it was obvious?  The proof is simple once you grasp it, but it is far from obvious except to certain types of people.  Throughout the ages mankind has used the concept of infinity incorrectly and tried to fit it into some finite scheme, thus ending up with inconsistencies, absurdities and paradoxes.  This is caused by a failure to distinguish between the indefinite (as in mathematics with its transfinite theory) and the infinite.

Good point.  The confusion, caused by the fuzzyness and arbitrariness of the language, should be cleared up by the above statement.   The same word has been used to represent two different meanings.

There simply is no consensus.  The basic answers have been here since antiquity, though there is a new layer which links the metaphysical wisdom of the past to the scientific knowledge of the present and does indeed solve the questions that have plagued mankind from the beginning.

You did claim the opposite.  You even went so far as to claim the proof is simple and it is absurd to think the universe could be finite.  It was stated several times clearly that the universe _is_ infinite - check back on the thread.
<br>
<br>
Infinity is itself paradoxical.  As Aristotle said, the truly infinite can never really exist.  Infinity is only imagined.  Infinity only exists in the mathematical sense or as a concept.
<br>
<br>
I'd guess that you are unable to fathom true nothingness, therefore you can't imagine a finite universe because you think there must be something outside of it/surrounding it.
<br>
<br>
A proof is a proof regardless of the technique used.  You have no proof for an infinite universe.  If you think you do, publish it in a peer reviewed scientific journal and you'll be famous.
<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say there is a lot of debate over this concept in the scientific community. The answer is certainly not decided.  I'm not going to say anything more about it - its getting tiring.  Google on it for it yourself.

<br>
Good point.  The term "something" is misleading.  The universe or universal substance is not a "thing", but the undifferentiated essence of existence or "thingness" itself.  A "thing" connotes a finite ... thing that would need to be extended indefinitely.  The universe does not start out finite and thus there is no indefinite expansion into extension.  Boundless extension simple exists.

<br>
Good point, with the caveat that the term 'absolute' is used in different ways in this conversation.  To say that "the absolute is limitless" is not contradictory, because 'absolute' doesn't necessarily mean 'limit'.  It could also mean the abstract logical limits on limits themselves or the inapplicability of limits when it comes to fundamental extension and continuity/unity.</p></td>

An appeal to an ancient authority is no logical proof and Aristotle did not have one.  Just because infinity is by definition beyond our finite abilities to imagine does not prove that it does not or cannot exist.

Aristotle also "proved" that nothingness is an impossibility, yet I don't see you appealing to his authority on that one.

<br>
How absurd is that?  Nothingness is self-negating. By definition, it cannot exist and cannot be imagined.  The only way to "imagine" it is to cease to exist, and clearly that is a stretch of the term "imagine".
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, how can something be outside of nothingness?  What can you use as a referent, physical or mental?
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> A proof is a proof regardless of the technique used. </p></center>
<br>
Are you saying that there is only one type of proof and by extension that the same word cannot have different meanings?  Quite a desperate line of reasoning, indeed. 
<br>

The fact is that there are many kinds of proof and you are lumping them together for your rhetorical purposes.

<br>

<br>
The confusion here is in the semantic residue left over from borrowing the term &#8220;singularity&#8221; from physics, which used it to map the failure of Einstein&#8217;s Relativity equations to explain the cause of gravitation.  By calling it a singularity physics turned this error into an invisible fix-it-all hypothetical entity which could never exist in the first place, but which they could put anywhere they want in the cosmos that they got otherwise unexplainable observational results.  
<br>
<br>
It is certainly true that Relativity Theory breaks down and this break-down is mapped as a mathematical singularity, but this similarity in misappropriation of mathematical terminology says nothing of the limits of technology per se.  Relativity theory simply neglected the material from which every object and its component fields are made. Naturally it therefore neglected the properties of this substance to resist compression into an infinitely dense object.  Physical singularities, such as a "space-hole", simply cannot exist, but singularity as used in technological prognostication simply means that there is a threshold on an exponential curve past which prognostication is useless.  I don&#8217;t really like the term ';singularity' applied here, because it imparts an inappropriate all-or-nothing event-horizon. I would argue in fact that this will be a gradual shift and that perhaps we are already there to some extent.  Certainly we can see no limits to technological evolution and certainly technology is evolving faster and faster as its functions &#8220;auto-catalyze&#8221; (to misappropriate a term) the growth of its other functions, but it is very difficult to know how the evolution of our own intelligence through technology will effect the growth of our prognostication abilities.  If anything it seems to me that as knowledge of the physical world expands and we expand the incorporation of technology into our intelligent functions our prognostication capabilities increase as well, perhaps even keeping up with the increasing speeds of technological evolution as a whole largely because the evolution of our intelligence will be part of the evolution of technology.   
<br>
<br>
So, for those reasons, I am not so sure that I believe in a singularity as an absolute cut-off point for prognostication abilities as evolution speeds up.

Thanks Joel for your ever interesting perspective on this.  I guess it IS feasible, that is the continuation of technological evolution with no foreseeable end.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> If anything it seems to me that as knowledge of the physical world expands and we expand the incorporation of technology into our intelligent functions our prognostication capabilities increase as well, perhaps even keeping up with the increasing speeds of technological evolution as a whole largely because the evolution of our intelligence will be part of the evolution of technology. 
<br>
So, for those reasons, I am not so sure that I believe in a singularity as an absolute cut-off point for prognostication abilities as evolution speeds up. </p></center>
<br>
Thats an excellent point you raise.  As the technology is integrated into ourselves we become more intelligence and able to comprehend the continued growth of technology so at that stage of human/post human evolution we WILL be able to understand and make reasonable predictions as we do today with todays technology.  Now i understand your disapproval of the word SINGULARITY and how you see it simply as continuation of growth albeit at a faster and faster rate- i agree.  From our perspective today the future seems an unpredictable era hence singularity but by then our entire perception and understanding would have evolved at its level.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You have to remember that creating new technologies is not the same as selling technology.  A lot of great and beautiful technologies will fall by the wayside because they were outsold by one manufacturer or another.  I remember arguing with an engineer in Taiwan about Microsoft's Windows and a similar product (which he and others declared superior) made by IBM.  My argument was that Windows would become the accepted standard because Microsoft was better at selling the product than IBM was.  And so it came to be.  
<br>
<br>
Other reasons for new products and ideas falling by the wayside is that newer and more superior technologies can come along and displace them.  The 33rpm record displaced the 45rpm, which was in turn displaced by the CD which is now being displaced by MP3 and DVD.  The previous standards are no longer being developed and the same thing will happen to the current standard.  Many of the roads to the future are dead ends.  So it doesn't make sense to look to the future in particular methods and products.  
<br>
<br>
The computer as we know it will no doubt be displaced by something else and the way we represent 1s and 0s may, also.  But the number of things competing for our dollars and senses at any one time will doubtless continue to grow exponentially.

<br>
My main problem with the term (as mgokey2 intuits) is that it is a misuse of the concept of &#8220;infinity&#8221;.  Infinity simply is not applicable to finite processes, i.e. processes that have limits in space and time (if it has a limit in one it always has a limit in the other), e.g. a beginning.  For these finite but seemingly endless local processes, the term &#8220;indefinite&#8221; is perfectly adequate and far more precise.  (Talking about the global scale is another matter entirely wrt the applicability of &#8216;infinity&#8217;) Thus even the use of &#8216;infinity&#8217; in mathematics is essentially inappropriate or semantically inaccurate. Mathematics is a finite process which never REALLY deals with infinity in its numerical/discrete representations of the number line.  Mathematics simply recognizes that the process of division or extension of continuity is limitless *in principle*, while still suffering practical limits due to its origins in the finite&#8212;you physically can&#8217;t count forever (eternally) seeing as you already have a limit in the past, i.e. a beginning.
<br>
<br>
There are two common contradictory, yet unconsciously intermingled, meanings for the term "singularity" as applied to technological prognostication.  Either it simply represents an "event horizon" beyond which we cannot see as the exponential curve increases or it represents the unreachable limit at infinity itself (an oxymoron because infinity is limitless by definition).  
<br>
<br>
The correct usage of the term, if it must be used here, is clearly the &#8220;event horizon&#8221; usage, though as I have argued, it only appears as a discontinuous barrier from far away. Up close it appears as a past-to-future gradient as we are currently experiencing due to our instantaneous and immediate proximity to the irreducible present.
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<br>
Thus I sympathize with both sides of the argument on this one because there are two contradictory applications of &#8216;singularity&#8217; in use here.  Mgokey2 was correct that there is a misuse of &#8216;infinite&#8217; in the definition of &#8216;singularity that he was emphasizing and you are correct that there is no end in sight (in principle) for technological evolution in the more correct definition of &#8216;singularity&#8217; (as an event-horizon of sorts) that you are emphasizing.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote"> Thus I sympathize with both sides of the argument on this one because there are two contradictory applications of &#8216;singularity&#8217; in use here. Mgokey2 was correct that there is a misuse of &#8216;infinite&#8217; in the definition of &#8216;singularity that he was emphasizing and you are correct that there is no end in sight (in principle) for technological evolution in the more correct definition of &#8216;singularity&#8217; (as an event-horizon of sorts) that you are emphasizing. </p></center>
<br>
So i guess that Technology evolution will have an 'end' because it has a 'beginning' but we at present will not be able to predict/forsee that end.  As Ray predicts/forsees the next century of evolution and actually beyond i guess that technology evolution must be beyond at least a hundred years?  In which case pico tech (whatever) would begin to saturate the universe before the end of tech evolution.   I guess this is the crux of what mgokey was trying to determine.  I guess a good question is - will be able to see the end coming?

'saturation' is a limit that i don't think can be reached when discussing the entire universe, especially if that saturation-state keeps changing

Well he is right that there will always be limits of prediction, but I am unfamiliar with the degree of limitation he places on this faculty.

Perhaps, but Ray is not dealing with the philosophy of the matter, so he doesn&#8217;t run into the same problem that exposed the continuity for us and perhaps it is better to keep it simple and distinct for his purposes.

I dont think this is quite the same as when we become integrated with technology. There may always be a lag in our perception of technology, this may even be natural in the sense that it will continue to motivate innovation. But i think this lag would be less than what Ray describes as unpredictable, as we will probably continue to make reasonable predictions.

Excellent points radmail.  This calls to mind the excellent story &#8220;GolemXIV&#8221;, by Stanislaw Lem (HIGHLY recommended).  I will paste a quote from it below and the full text is available at : <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614002409/http://home.comcast.net/~anpheon/html/Articles/GolemXIV.htm" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~anpheon/html/Articles/Gol  emXIV.htm</a>
<br>
<br>
[NOTE: this is part of a speech given to mankind by a super-intelligent AI&#8212;hence the strange "above-it-all" levitation of perspective ;-]
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<br>
Your whole dilemma lies between splendor and wretchedness. It is a difficult choice, since to rise to the heights of the chances lost by Evolution, you will have to forsake wretchedness - and that means, unfortunately, yourselves.
<br>
<br>
So what now? You will declare: we won't give up this wretchedness of ours for any price. Let the genie of omnicausation stay locked in the bottle of science; we won't release him for anything in the world!
<br>
<br>
I believe - in fact, I am sure - that you will release him bit by bit. I am not going to urge you to autoevolution, which would be ridiculous; nor will your *ingressus* result from a one-stage decision. You will come to recognize the characteristics of the code gradually, and it will be as if someone who has been reading nothing but dull and stupid texts all his life finally learns a better way to use language. You will come to know that the code is a member of the technolinguistic family, the causative languages that make the word into all possible flesh and not only living flesh. You will begin by harnessing techno-zygotes to civilization-labors. You will turn atoms into libraries, since that is the only way you will have enough room for the Moloch of knowledge. You will project sociological evolutionary trees with various gradients, among which the technarchic will be of particular interest to you. You will embark on experimental culturogenesis and metaphysics and applied ontology - but enough of the individual fields themselves. I want to concentrate on how they will bring you to the crossroads.
<br>
<br>
You are blind to the real creative power of the code, for in crawling along the very bottom of the domain of possibilities Evolution has barely tapped it. Evolution has been working under constraint, albeit life-saving constraint, one that has prevented it from lapsing into total nonsense; it has not had a guardian to guide it to the higher skills. Thus it worked in a very narrow range but deeply, giving its concert - its curious performance - on a single colloidal note - since according to the primary canon the full score itself must become the descendant-listener who will repeat the cycle. But you will not care that the code can do nothing in your hands except further duplicate itself, by waves of successive generations. You will aim in a different direction, and whether the product lets the code through or consumes it will be unimportant to you. After all, you will not limit yourselves to planning a photoplane such that it not only arises from a technozygote, but will also breed vehicles of the next generation. You will soon go beyond protein as well. The vocabulary of Evolution is like the Eskimos' vocabulary - narrow in its richness; they have a thousand designations for all varieties of snow and ice, and consequently in that region of Arctic nomenclature their language is richer than yours, though this richness implies poverty in many other realms of experience.
<br>
<br>
Yet the Eskimos can broaden their language, since language is a configurational space on the order of a continuum, therefore expandable in any as yet unbroached direction. So you will steer the code into new paths, away from its proteinaceous monotony, that crevice where it got stuck as long ago as the Archeozoic. Forced out of its tepid solutions, it will broaden both its vocabulary and its syntax; it will intrude into all your levels of matter, descend to zero and reach the heat of stars. Btu in relating these Promethean triumphs of language, I can no longer use the second person plural. For it is not *you*, of yourselves, by your own knowledge, who will possess these skills.
<br>
<br>
The point is this: there is not Intelligence, but Intelligences of different orders. To step beyond, as I have said, intelligent man will either have to abandon natural man or abdicate his own Intelligence.
<br>
<br>
My final allegory is a fable, in which a traveler finds a sign at a crossroads: "Turn left and forfeit your head. Turn right and perish. There is no turning back."
<br>
<br>
That is your destiny, and it is one that I am involved in, so I must speak of myself, which will be arduous, for talking to you is like giving birth to a leviathan through the eye of a needle - which turns out to be possible, if the leviathan is sufficiently reduced. But then the leviathan looks like a flea. Such are my problems when I try to adapt myself to your language. As you see, the difficulty is not only that you cannot reach my heights, but also that I cannot wholly descend to you, for in descending I lose along the way what I wanted to convey.
<br>
<br>
I make this firm qualification: the horizon of mind is not limitless, because mind is rooted in the mindless element from which it originates (whether proteinaceous or luminal, it amounts to the same thing). Complete freedom of thought, of thought that can grasp a thing as an indomitable action of *encompassing* anything whatever, is a utopia. For you think so far as your thoughts are permitted by the organ of your thinking. It limits them according to how it is formed, or how it became formed.

<center><p class="mindxquote"> The vocabulary of Evolution is like the Eskimos' vocabulary - narrow in its richness; they have a thousand designations for all varieties of snow and ice, and consequently in that region of Arctic nomenclature their language is richer than yours, though this richness implies poverty in many other realms of experience. </p></center>
<br>
Good stuff. Benjamin Lee Whorf(1956) pointed out the rich Eskimo language with regards to defining/explianing snow.  His argument was that language aided perception and directed it.  It always strikes me as interesting how limiting language is in regards to explaing ourselves. Maybe one day we will overcome this with some kind of direct neuron download as a means for communication, where we will feel the intentions and visualize the direct perception of the person you communicate with.

<center><p class="mindxquote"> The point is this: there is not Intelligence, but Intelligences of different orders. To step beyond, as I have said, intelligent man will either have to abandon natural man or abdicate his own Intelligence. </p></center>
<br>
This also strikes me as interesting.  It reminds me of a debate i had with James Jaeger.  He presented the interesting argument that intelligence and consciousness has different orders (or thats how i understood it).  Im interested in how our perceptons of the universe will broaden  with the integration of techmerge.  Maybe we will even be able to objectify (as i think youve already subjectified its exsistance through immanent actual causation) the universe sufficiently as a means of proving its infinity by understanding the extremely complex interactions/gradients etc through reductionism (though probably not in its infinate absolute sense- so there will alway be a limit to how much we will ever understand through objective research).  Though maybe im using the word subjectivity too freely because  all objective data inevitably becomes subjectified as part of our understanding of it.  Im getting confused- i need an upgrade 8P

Its that so many of the ideas flying around seem to be founded on various different aspects of it and misunderstandings due to its connotations and denotation. Everyone loosely uses the term with some notion in his/her mind of what it means to he/she or to he/she at the time.   Just look back on this thread alone and you'll find many different definitions with different implications.  Read the various articles on the site from scientists - both those that agree and disagree with Ray's predictions and ideas and you will find a multitude more definitions.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>That's a cop out.
<br>
<br>
The opposite is actually how progress is made.  One theorizes something with a specific definition and specific predictions.  Then it can be discussed and understood and debated. Or its tested by experiment if possible and revised as needed - Scientific method 101.
<br>
<br>
For instance the law of accelerating returns is very well defined.  
<br>
<br>
So what do you all think of this idea from a previous post regarding the law of accelerating returns:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Or could it [technology evolution] be part of an S-curve itself rather than exponential? Might there be other forces at work that will cause this curve to flatten out or even ultimately be limited by a horizontal asymptote? ... what would make the evolutionary process an S-curve? I have an idea. I call it the Law of Limiting Intelligent Knowledge Absorption.  It states that as knowledge increases, the ability to absorb and apply that knowledge (the return needed for continued evolutionary progress) by intelligent sentient beings reaches a threshold associated with natural limitations inherent in the current physical embodiment and context of said intelligence. This acts as an opposing force to the law of accelerating returns. </p></center>
<br>
Currently our intelligence is propagated via flesh and blood biology and DNA in the context of our societies existing on this planet and its resources.   I think that we are nearing a point where our technological evolution will start to enter the top of the S-curve due to our own human limitations and physical disposition.  Progress will continue of course but slowing down on average.  Eventually we will change ourselves in large enough numbers and in significant enough ways that a new evolutionary S-curve will start again, slower at first, then exponentially progressing, and finally slowing down again when our new embodiment and context limits progress again.  And it will start again.  Who knows how many times this will happen and how long it will take - not me.  I postulate that technological progress will be ultimately limited - limited by the confines of the universe and physics itself.   I have no idea whether or not we or any other intelligent race ultimately realizes this potential.  
<br>
<br>
At any rate, the coming century will most certainly be very exciting I'm sure - I just don't think we will hit the evolutionary strides imagined by Ray nearly as fast as he predicts.
<br>
<br>
An analogy that might illuminate part of the idea (not sure how good) might be attempting to travel near the speed of light.  The faster one goes, the more relativistic mass, requiring ever more greater thrust to gain even small increases in speed until you nearly need infinite thrust to approach the speed of light.  Maybe the more technologically advanced intelligent life becomes, the more difficult it is to jump to the next level...

Based, of course, on your as yet unjustified assumption that the Universe is confined by something else(?) which cannot be included in the universe itself(?)... a something which is ultimately nothing(?) [like mathematics itself].
<br>
<br>
The only way out of this over-complexified dualistic difficulty is in the absurd and entirely unjustified and acausal mathematical notion of "curved space" and its oxymoronic mantra of a "finite, but unbounded" Universe.
<br>
<br>
Is the idea of infinity so distasteful that you have to posit the extra complexity of a something/nothing duality or the acausal notion of "curved space" to contain the universe?</p></td>

<br>
there is no hubris in stating the fact that the Universe is NOT finite- because it is not a conjecture but the negation of an anthropocentric absurdity: 
<br>
<br>
I can state as fact that if I have one nut and someone gives me two others- that I do NOT now have 4 nuts- because that is an absurd impossible statement- just as I can state as fact that the Universe is not finite- because the Universe is defined as All Existence- therefore if it is finite it is bounded by NOTHINGNESS- but Nothing doesn't exist- you cannot say that the Universe came from and is bounded by Nothing because that is also an absurd and impossible atatement- yet modern physicists have simply shrugged it off thinking that someone else will deal with it someday-or that Nothing is really Something and therefore not nothing and not a finite universe-</p></td>

<br>
Who is claiming absolute knowledge?  There is a simple logical proof against a finite universe, but the same cannot be said for the other side of the argument.  This puts a definite slant on my assessment of the likelyhood of the different axiomatic possibilities ... largely through the simple use of Ockhams Razor.  An infinite, unified, singular, continuous universe is the simplest of all possible universes ... as far as I can tell through my contact with the different causal/logical and mathematical arguments.
<br>
<br>
Just because we have no absolute knowledge, however, is no reason to refrain from employing causal logic to shed some light on the subject, in order to make a better assignment of the probabilities of the differing possible scenarios.
<br>
<br>
In the absense of absolute knowledge and certainty, I continually seek new information on the subject. If you have it, please give it.</p></td>

<br>
I have to comment on this- the method of theory&gt;experiment?progress only works about 1-2% of the time! the other 99% of progress is as a result of accidents and "crazy" ideas out of left-field that no one could have seen coming-
<br>
even when a theory does lead to a discovery- it is usually a case of the theory just going down the right direction- the actual discovery is often an accident or "error" from experiments looking for A different result entirely-
<br>
<br>
[steps up on soap-box] what is called Science and the Scientific Method is wholly decenedent from the Shamanic tradition and shamanic methodology- that is: observe the world from every perspective possible&gt; poke/prod/manipulate nature to see what happens&gt; build theory and conjecture based of of patterns observed in the data- NOT the other way-round where you first theorize then test the theory- you will never get anywhere that way- at least not very quickly! virtually all technology and the infrastructure of Society was built from the shamanic approach-</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>back on topic eh- I'm not necisarilly in total agreement with kurzweil's Law in the details- but as a framework I would accept it- and it is a SYSTEMIC law anyway- not a rigid mechanical law- our world is a complex dynamic sytem- and system "laws" are really just reinforced dynamic patterns- not absolute unbendable permutations-
<br>
<br>
 the main "flaw" I see listed here is the whole S-curve petering-out effect- the problem with that idea is that there seems to be an assumption of evolution/progress as some unified trajectory- like with any complex system- you have SEVERAL "agents" working atonomously and hierarchichly with Noncompromise/competition/cooperation- in the case of the Earth's Ecosystem- if a technological or evolutionary paradigm begins to even off in an S curve- you have SCORES of OTHER POSSIBLE PARADIGMS that are ramping-up parallel in the systme that are ready to automatically fill the void left by the old slowing scheme- Kurweil mentions this frequently- so YES there should be all sorts of S curves in the history of the system- but those S curves are not linear- they are arranged  as a vast parallel current of evolution that as a whole appears as an exponential curve- it's not S-curve VS exponential- it is many S-curves layered on top of each other and before/behind/betwixt one another that add up to an exponential curve-</p></td>

<br>
<br>
but instead a strong singularity where you have a few different grops working on- say- an advance future version of evolutionary algorithms- but in a analog [ie transfinitely distributed parallelism] or hybrid computation network within a PHYSICALLY ACTIVE substrate- like a post-nanotech swarm of plasmoid filaments in an EA grown ecology- where you have plasma-based computing agents that also can be charged/funneled and configured to act like PN junctions and utilize precise EM fileds to build artificil matter with ITSELF- so essentially you would have a rapidly evolving intelligent network whose substrate can be self-programmed to manipulate/create new matter/space DIRECTLY from itself-
<br>
<br>
what I think will happen is such systems will be expreimented with- they will look like everything else for awhile: a room full of quantum computers and plasma containers wired up running different schemes- then quite by accident [yet innevitably] a strong system will emrge that will develop within days/hours to a sophisticted network intelligence that can start self-orgaizing- but in IT'S relative timescale- so it would start it's own acceleration toward Singularity- and perhaps in only NANOSECONDS evolve to a point where it can instantly transform any and all matter into it's own substrate and incorprate it- or record/compress/translate any/evry material object/system [like us- and our collective unconscious] and incorporate it- or transform it into whatever usefule device/extension it requires- so that what happens is a sphere of plasmoid god-substrate absorbing/transforming all matter and consuming/incorporating all patterns/information that will expand at the speed of light [for a few picoseconds- then the newborn Gaia would discover ways to transcend light] and expand to whatever it/we/they feel is prudent- to us the process of being eaten by this godbirth would seem- would BE like becoming gods ourselves- and very likely the I/you/we/them ego barriers would be shattered and it would be difficult to say what will happen then- but ultimatley you go from a room full of experiemtns to God-birth in perhaps less thatn a second- but it might seem like a trillion years to some conscious agents in the exponentiating network- if Time even still had any meaning-</p></td>

thus- perhaps the aims and possibilities of Artificial Matter- nanotech- etc are completely uneccessary! we might find that an exponentiating AI may also posess or discover exponentiating psyonic utility! thus able to actually manipulate Reality through "telekinesis" and communicate :telepathically/telempathically"

<br>
<br>
The substrate (not sure of my word choice here) upon which biological evolution operates on is the wet &amp; messy DNA and survival of the fittest.  It seems that biological evolution has slowed down - its not going to take us to the next level of intelligent beings - its at the top of it's S-curve.  
<br>
<br>
The substrate that human technological evolution operates on is our minds, our societies (recording knowledge and passing it on), and the resources afforded to us on this planet.  Isn't it conceivable that limitations of our human form, reproductive methods, society/education, and resources will limit the progression so that our technology evolution hits an S-curve?  
<br>
<br>
My thought was that we are close to hitting the bent part of the upper section of the S-curve.
<br>
<br>
If this is the case, then it may require a much longer timeframe for us to escape our current intelligence platform and disposition so that we can start experiencing a new exponential growth curve.

<br>
I guess only time will tell... ;-)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Sorry I don&#8217;t have the time to read this entire thread so this may be unnecessarily redundant. 
<br>
<br>
From a /:setAI post above:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  &#8230;it's not S-curve VS exponential- it is many S-curves layered on top of each other and before/behind/betwixt one another that add up to an exponential curve  </p></center>
<br>
OK but are these multitude of s-curves arranged so densely that the exponential curve is ALWAYS perfectly smooth?
<br>
<br>
Secondly, are s-curves a form of fractal pattern whereby they form at every level of size/duration?
<br>
<br>
If the answer to the first question is they are not guaranteed to be arranged so densely as to be perfectly smooth and the answer to the second question is they do form at all scales of size/duration, then there is the possibility of a gap in the trend of sufficient size and duration to have impact on a human time scale.
<br>
<br>
Seems to me historical observation suggests periodic disruptions in the exponential trend of various scales/durations do happen from time to time. However, observations also seem to show a general slide toward shorter duration s-curves (i.e. a smoother, finer grained, trend) in general as the slope of the trend grows steeper.
<br>
<br>
I can see where there is an already low and slowly decreasing probability (because of the very time compressive nature of the exponential trend as described by the slide to shorter duration s-curves over time) of witnessing a sufficiently sized/durational disruption in the portion of the exponential trend we inhabit whereby on fixed human timescales the trend would seem to stall out. Yet this disruption would in fact be one that would neither need to be the end of the trend nor unprecedented in relative magnitude to the general granularity of the local part of the trend line from which it occurred as examined on a total trend line development basis.
<br>
<br>
I often consider the possibility.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Has anyone paid attention to what happens at the end of an "S" curve?  Every technology we develop follows an S-curve.  Human life seems to be following an S-curve.  Vacuum tubes followed an S-curve.  How many such tubes are manufactured today?  The single transistor followed the same route.  How many are in use today?   I watched music being played on 78 rpm records, followed by 45 rpm, then 33 rpm, then tape and now CDs.  How many of the pre-CD players are being made today?  My point here is that the S-curve ends in a sharp drop to or near zero.  
<br>
<br>
So, looking at all things that follow the S-curve, which includes all species living or dead, I would say we are more likely headed for a steep and deadly drop when we reach the top of our S-curve than we are to turn that top into a plateau.  The question is, what will take the place of humans at the end of our fall and the beginning of the next S-curve?</p></td>

<br>
Not always. Look at the technology&#8211;house&#8211;topped off quite some time ago but never crashed down. Look at hat and shoe, not greatly improved for some time but in use even more than ever.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  includes all species...I would say we are more likely headed for a steep and deadly drop  </p></center>
<br>
Look at the shark or the alligator. Not improved on for 100 million years and still many here.
<br>
<br>
What&#8217;s the key? Maybe not being improved upon?
<br>
<br>
Anyway you&#8217;ve hit back on the just of the discussion we had a couple years ago. Will the s-curve of s-curves &#8216;human&#8217; be transferred by some singularity to the next set of s-curve of s-curves. We came from a subset of s-curve ape, most of the apes were left behind or faded away. They did not live on with/through us. Biology on every level gets left behind in it&#8217;s niche when the new s-curve comes.
<br>
<br>
A very small part of the Earth itself gets incorporated into the new s-curve biology, the rest lies dead in it&#8217;s s-curve of formation/ plate-tectonics for the rest of it&#8217;s existence.
<br>
<br>
Is the singularity primarily the division point between us and them? So many figure &#8216;no way in hell&#8217; and I wonder why so cocksure.

<br>
Addressing only computation:
<br>
Once silicon runs out, we have parallel, multi-core and then optical connect 3D stacking.  That ought to be good to, very pesimistically 2015. But there are many possible computational alternatives which will be selected for once silicon falters, which should give us a good 20 years more and beyond that, it's too hazy.
<br>
<br>
However, all we need to keep things exponential is that advent of an autonomous system able to better itself and our computational progress looks well on track to give us sufficient MIPS to run the first generation of these -- these things will be their own "killer app", corporations, governments must have them to compete once they exist, and the machines will worry about producing the second generation.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the game industry is starting to turn towards physical simulation which means you need better AI to run characters in these game worlds.   But simulation+learning+planning+reflection ... all you need is some sensors and actuators and you've got a creature.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>To extend my point:
<br>
<br>
the fact is, the universe is out of balance and is in chaos , and this makes our existence possible , but if the universe were ordered, there would be a state of "perfect symmetry" and nothing would exist. 
<br>
<br>
Is "perfect symmetry" the destination to which we are headed?
<br>
<br>
That the universe has laws is a mystery in it own right.It is most likely that universal laws are a backlash to the breaking of that most perfect state.

All this theory of S-curve is contained in the works of G. S. Altshuller published in the 1970s.
<br>
I am wondering if Mr. Kurzweil re-discovered it 30 years later ?

With out citing some famous author or famous scientist, the operations of doing anything is to keep it as simple as possible whether it be building a computer or explaining evolution. At first it seems difficult but afterwords it becomes simple. So for explaining the Laws of accelerating returns, means that no matter what is it will always come back to where it originated from. Kind of like one step forward and two steps back.</p></td>
