<div class="TeaserText">In <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dertouzos_entry.html">Michael Dertouzos</a>, 1936 -- 2001.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published August 30, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>The passing of <a class="thought" href="entries/dertouzos_entry.html">Michael Dertouzos</a> leaves a large void.  I cannot think of anyone else who contributed in as many diverse ways, all of which were infused with his humanitarian concern, and <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a>.  </p>
<p>I recall a time in 1987, right before I was to speak to a group of MIT students, I was anxious to get to the lecture on time, but he was more eager to hear about my entrepreneurial struggles.  Although I've had many such interchanges over the decades, I recall this one vividly because of the enthusiasm, delight and fatherly warmth he so innately displayed.  I left that encounter greatly encouraged by his support, a feeling that has lasted to this day.  He has done the same with countless students and innovators, as for example his mentoring of <a class="thought" href="entries/berners-lee_entry.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> Consortium, prior to the world having heard about Tim's <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> idea.  </p>
<p>In addition to teacher and mentor, Michael was himself an innovator as an accomplished <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, and as the director of MIT's celebrated Laboratory for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Sciences for more than a quarter century.  His most recent passion has been "Project <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">Oxygen</a>," seeking to make computers "as natural a part of our environment as the air we breathe."  "<a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">Oxygen</a>" is an apt <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dertouzos_entry.html">Michael Dertouzos</a>' passion, which has been applying <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to meet human needs, and ultimately to relieve human suffering.</p>
<p>It was on the issue of human suffering that Michael and I had our most recent interaction in a series of point -- counterpoint articles in MIT's <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Review.  We were both taking issue with <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s prescription of relinquishing the pursuit of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in certain areas that may engender new dangers, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.  In keeping with Michael's delight in the power of a debate to illuminate a complex subject, we approached the issue from different perspectives, and had a lively exchange on the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and its impact.  We were fully in agreement, however, on Michael's closing statement, which sums up his own pioneering contributions, "This process [of applying our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>] will serve us best if, alongside our most promising technologies, we bring our full humanity, augmenting our rational powers with our feelings, our actions, and our faith."</p>

<br>
His latest book What wil be? Was an inspiration for us all. In the age of gold fever and dot.com rush, What will be described how technology can and will be applied to not make millions for the massses, but to serve civilization and to contribute to society as a whole.
<br>
I believe we have now entered a phase in technology where we can make some of his dreams a reality.

<br>
<br>
Imagine a village where the barber shaves everyone who doesn't shave himself.  Who shaves this barber?
<br>
<br>
If the barber doesn't need to shave, this situation is entirely possible, logically and empirically.
<br>
<br>
It's like the village where the dental hygienist cleans the teeth of everyone who doesn't clean her own teeth.  Who cleans the dental hygienist's teeth?  If the dental hygienist is toothless, this situation is not paradoxical.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
The barber either shaves himself or isn't shaved.  Just because he shaves everyone who shaves himself does NOT mean he does not also shave those who DO shave themselves.  It doesn't say he shaves ONLY those who do not shave themselves, does it?

<br>
Ditto on the dental hygienist.
<br>
<br>
Say I do the brick work for all the homes in my county that are costing the owners more than a million dollars to build.
<br>
This doesn't mean I can't be doing the brick work on my own $900K house, does it?  I think not.

Indeed, I think not, therefore I am. :)</p></td>
