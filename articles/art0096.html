<p>Virtual Reality was born as a movement and a medium back in the 
              late 80s and early 90s which sought to invent technologies that 
              completely immerse people in 3D graphical spaces, usually with head-mounted 
              displays or other <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. Apart from some serious medical issues 
              with the approach (vertigo or nausea in 60% of those who tried it), 
              VR suffered from another problem: it sought to really impress people 
              by flashy virtual worlds totally devoid of social interactions (i.e.: 
              for most part you were totally alone in these worlds). VR and those 
              who supported it largely ignored the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are 
              social, communicative <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. Empty worlds are just not interesting 
              enough for most of us to return to. To top it all off, much of the 
              VR <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> was visually very unappealing.</p>
<p>Some notable exceptions include <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.tauzero.com/Brenda_Laurel/Placeholder/Placeholder.html" target="_blank">Placeholder 
              by Brenda Laurel, Rachel Strickland and Rob Tow (1992)</a> and Char 
              Davies' Osmose (1995). Seminal work was also done by Scott Fisher 
              et al. at <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> Ames <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Human Factors Lab in 1986-88 (for which 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/lanier_entry.html">Jaron Lanier</a>'s first Head Mounted Display was commissioned). And 
              of course the precursor technologies pioneered by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.telefonica.es/fat/ekrueger.html" target="_blank">Myron 
              Krueger and Vincent John Vincent</a> are <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant for what they

              was doing <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in remote presence and avatars with projection 
              schemes. Again, Scott Fisher and Susan Brennan were important players 
              (as well as Negroponte) in this early work. More recently, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.irobot.com/home/default.asp" target="_blank">Rod 
              Brooks</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> fame has done something interesting to tease

              Brandt's pages on Virtual Healing</a>).</p>
<h2><b>So where did virtual communities come from?</b></h2>
<p>Emerging during the 1970s and even earlier social and game play 
              experiments in online systems, a movement grew in the 80s involving 
              thousands of people on text-based <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s who were "building" 
              virtual worlds out of words. These were the first true inhabited 
              community spaces, called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.mud.org/" target="_blank">MUDs</a>, 
              MOOs and the like. These simple non-graphical spaces used the power 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to construct <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. How can you build a world out of 
              words? You are watching text like "you enter the room, there 
              is a bot standing over there that says <i>hello, I have a message 
              for you</i>, and you notice a shiny glass box on the floor.." 
              and a narrative, a story forms in your head. It's as easy as that. 
              These "text based Virtual Realities" had a profound impact 
              on their citizenry and certainly produced more real immersion than 
              was ever achieved by VR. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://main.placeware.com/about/curtis.html" target="_blank">Pavel 
              Curtis</a>, one of the leaders of this movement declared seven years 
              ago that "people are the killer app of the Internet". 
              He was right then and he is right today. </p>

              Phenomenon in Text-Based Virtual Realities (1992)</a></p>
<h2><b>So what happened after VR, how could you get people into <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">Cyberspace</a>?</b></h2>
<p>An amazing thing happens when you combine text based virtual communities 
              like MUDs with powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/gaming_entry.html">gaming</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s (one of which astounded the 
              world with <i>Doom</i> in 1994), you can create an compelling inhabited 
              3D space with the social and story power of language. And several 
              visionaries did just this by 1995 creating some truly magic, that 
              could be experienced by everyone. Lets look at their story next</p>

<p align="left"><i>Beam me in Scotty! An avatar materializes in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hub_entry.html">hub</a> of the Worlds Chat Space Station in Spring 1995, and a whole 
              new Cyberspace is born!</i></p>
<p>In the Spring of 1995, with little fanfare, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/wchat.html" target="_blank">Worlds 
              Chat</a>, a bona fide "avatar" virtual world was launched 
              on the Internet. An avatar is a likeness of a person as seen in 
              cyberspace, usually in a 2D or 3D visual space. No goggles or wrap 
              around displays were needed to interact in Worlds Chat. Users on 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 486 PCs, could simply <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, connect on a 14.4 
              modem, and launch themselves into a space station in Cyberspace. 
              Other people online live in Worlds Chat scooted around the station 
              in avatars ranging from a fish to a kid in a tie-dyed T-shirt. I 
              was personally amazed by Worlds Chat when I entered it for the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on May 11, 1995 (see my piece <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/book/intro/preface.htm" target="_blank">Visions 
              of Avatar Cyberspace</a> for this recollection). I <a class="thought" href="entries/ginger_entry.html">ginger</a>ly navigated 
              into the hub, oh so careful to not bump into anyone, not knowing 
              the local social mores. The design of the space and its soundscapes 
              was attractive and, boy, was it fast and smooth to move around.</p>
<h2><b>So where did the term "Avatar" come from?</b></h2>
<p><i>Definition: Avatar, <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">Chip</a> Morningstar, 1985:</i> "Originally 
              the term avatar came from Hindu mythology and is the name for the 
              temporary body a <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">god</a> inhabits while visiting <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. Avatar can also 
              denote an embodiment or concrete manifestation of an abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>. 
              The ancient Sanskrit term avatara meant "a passing down". 
              Avatar was first coined for use in describing users' visual embodiment 
              in Cyberspace by Chip Morningstar in the early days of the first 
              avatar environment Habitat back in 1985. In text-based virtual communities, 
              the term avatar is not used, users are identified instead by handles, 
              aliases or nicknames. Avatars are also called: characters, players, 
              virtual actors, icons, or virtual humans in other virtual communities 
              or gaming worlds. " From "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/" target="_blank">Avatars</a>!" 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/book/appendix/glossary.htm" target="_blank">glossary</a>

              in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.usyd.edu.au/su/social/papers/farmer1.html" target="_blank">From

<p><i>Considering one's embodiment at the mirror in the Worlds Chat

<p>But the biggest thing I was conscious of was that.. hey, there 
              are real people here! I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, "it is beginning, real Cyberspace" 
              that we all have read about, in fiction from <a class="thought" href="entries/gibson_entry.html">William Gibson</a>'s "Neuromancer"

              Stephenson's</a> "Snow Crash" to the virtual worlds of 
              Hollywood. After all, surfing web pages is hardly experiencing Cyberspace. 
              In the 2D Web there is truly no "there" there, just a 
              bunch of linked documents, highly practical, no doubt, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> 
              of former generations of the readers of Vanevar Bush (see his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm" target="_blank">As

              Worlds</a> was a phenomenal explosion of architecture, where untold 
              hundreds of thousands of users constructed a vast, unplanned cityscape 
              on a pristine green <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> plain. These 3D spaces were "colonized" 
              and constructed by real people working at home on modems and their

              its <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> (see the AlphaWorld map here). In AlphaWorld, 3D was 
              about creating new powerful ways to be together with people. 3D

<p>So how did the first generation avatar virtual worlds companies

              and companies just don't mix well sometimes (more about that later). 
              Surprisingly, often when the company that created a particular avatar 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> goes dot-<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a> bust, the communities keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>s up

<p>Well, the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of avatar and multi-player gaming virtual worlds 
              on the Net since 1995 is now going beyond its dedicated early adopter 
              community and is headed for the mainstream. The pioneering early 
              citizen community and its experiences of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in a social, creative 
              and spatial Cyberspace, is a bellwether for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of interaction 
              and their stories are powerful indicators of the coming dimensions 
              of life online. Of course the old battle lines will reemerge here: 
              you only live in a place if you can make it your own, but you have 
              to pay for it, and someone is going to broker goods into your community 
              for that privilege. Is it the future of Cyberspace to be more like 
              the creative noncommercial instant city of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.burningman.com/" target="_blank">Burning 
              Man</a> or the glittery pocketbook-evaporating casinos of nearby 
              Reno? Can true community exist within or sponsored by companies? 
              How about <a class="thought" href="entries/open_source_entry.html">open source</a>, Charodic or franchised virtual community 
              economic systems, can they evolve and grow in the face of the two-headed 
              Tyrannosaurus Rex of AOL/Time Warner?</p>
<h2><b>Why don't you like to call all this Virtual Reality?</b></h2>
<p>Well, in truth, these virtual worlds are not trying to be immersive, 
              in fact, the graphics <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> less than the quality of the communication 
              between people. Embodiment of a person online comes through dialogue, 
              with the scenery and dress taking second place. And, there is nothing 
              "virtual" about the "reality" of people's interactions 
              and lives in these worlds, where they meet people and experience 
              events that touch them as deeply as anything in "RL" (Real 
              Life) .</p>

<h2><b>Some people claim that you would naturally want your own image

<p>To paraphrase <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.dipaola.org/steve/" target="_blank">Steve 
              DiPaola</a> (professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia 
              Canada), attempts to achieve photorealism in virtual space or in 
              the representation of people is subject to powerful laws of diminishing 
              returns. The more realistic the attempt, the more open to criticism 
              it becomes and the more costly the technology to reproduce it. For 
              example, recently I have been contacted by a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of companies 
              (or <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> reporting on them) who are yet again trying to create 
              businesses riding on photorealistic talking heads. In 6 years I 
              have seen every single one of these type of efforts fail to attract 
              any user base. In fact, at our first conference on Avatars (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.ccon.org/events/conf96.html" target="_blank">Earth 
              to Avatars 1996</a>) there was such a company. I watched as they 
              wrapped photographs of attendees around 3D models, eager to create 
              a stampede to "put yourself in cyberspace". Without exception, 
              every person presented with a wonderful rotatable version of their 
              own visage blushed, laughed, was embarrassed or otherwise weirded 
              out by the results. </p>

<p>Why were they so weirded out? For starters, most people don't like 
              what they look like in photographs, or even mirrors. Our media and 
              commercial culture has taught us that unless we are <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.britneyspears.com/" target="_blank">Britney 
              Spears</a>, we don't measure up. Ordinariness is no longer OK-ness, 
              especially for women. In 6 years of Avatar experience online, it 
              is a rare sight indeed to see a real likeness of a citizen. That's 
              the whole point and power of life behind the digital veil.. anonymity 
              and being what you want to be today! Hey, nobody bought videophones 
              in 1960, and nobody buys them today. The telephone provides a kind 
              of glorious anonymity and <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> from having to be seen in the 
              right visual social state.</p>

<p></p>
<p><i>The author as a photorealistic avatar model (courtesy Peter 
              Huges at Live Picture), in a word.. yikes!</i></p>
<p>But it goes deeper than that, far into our evolutionary past. My 
              anthropologist friends tell me that it is likely that the plains 
              of Africa 2 to 5 million years ago saw may <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> groups bashing 
              each other's brains out. Therefore, for most of our time on this 
              Earth we have been terrified of "the other", or "the 
              stranger". From UFO believers, to horror flicks, the most frightening 
              thing to a human is another human with a distorted face. On the 
              African Veldt, the face was likely the best way to determine friend 
              and foe, my subspecies or yours, and it was a matter of life or 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. Presenting a digitally distorted human face.. now that is 
              dangerous territory. Nothing weirds out a person faster. We will 
              accept cartoons, masks, <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>s, even just straight old flat 
              photos, but try to create a deformable, 3D head and that's where 
              some seriously ancient social <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s kick in.</p>
<p>I wish the many ventures that try to do photorealistic avatars 
              or bots and agents well in these efforts, but don't burn through 
              too much of someone else's money before you do some focus groups, 
              or enter real living avatar spaces and ask citizens what they prefer 
              and why. Eventually we may become used to high resolution realism 
              in our avatars or talking head webguides, but like the old VR field, 
              it might not be too late to hire that primatologist!</p>
<h2><b>So people are weirded out by photorealism in their own avatars, 
              what about bots and agents, will these be accepted as substitutes 
              for real personal interaction online like Ray claims?</b></h2>
<p>Well your readers may ask here, "what is a bot"? The 
              word <b>bot</b> is a shortened form of the term "robot" 
              a Czech word coined by Karel Capek in a play in the early part of 
              the last Century. Robot is derived from Rabotai, which means "to 
              work" in Czech. In its fictional life, a robot is an artificial 
              human brought into this world to perform work (most real robots 
              don't look humanoid at all and labor out of sight in assembly lines). 
              Bots on the net most often refer to little bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>, running 
              within a <a class="thought" href="entries/chat_room_entry.html">chat room</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/mud_entry.html">MUD</a> or MOO, or embodied as a visual object in 
              a virtual world. That code is likely to be designed to interact 
              with real users in the community to provide services. For example, 
              bots in textual MUD worlds were often designed remember a phrase 
              told them by one user, to be repeated later to another when they 
              entered the room inhabited by the bot. Bots in 3D virtual worlds 
              frequented by real people in their avatars have blossomed in the 
              past two years, doing everything from performance (marching bands) 
              to building <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s (speaker rooms at cyber-conferences). More 
              on that later when we tell the story of Xelag and his life with 
              bots.</p>
<h2><b>So what is an <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">Agent</a>, how is that different from a Bot?</b></h2>
<p><b>Agents</b> on the other hand come from engineering traditions, 
              and are most likely to be bits of code designed to interact with 
              other bits of code. Agents, sometimes called <a class="thought" href="entries/daemon_entry.html">daemon</a>s, run at the 
              lower levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s, clean up trash on servers, engage 
              in big scientific and industrial simulations, and do other machine 
              to machine tasks. Lately there has been a move to bring agents into 
              the realm of interaction with people online, most often occurring 
              as a "talking head" <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>al agent, and text-based 
              question and answer interfaces. Agents are thus likely to be isolated 
              on a web site and not within the interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of a living 
              virtual world or text-based chat environment.</p>

              a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> more entertaining.</i></p>
<p>I would say honestly that for me the "talking head" style 
              agent that you see above may have as big a problem gaining acceptance 
              as the photorealistic heads described earlier. You know what, people 
              just hate those automated phone answering systems many "customer 
              service" organizations subject us to. We are bombarded daily 
              with impersonal interfaces, companies and <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s trying to 
              save money or who have lost touch with their businesses present 
              us with cost saving, frustrating systems. Talking head agents come 
              dangerously close to triggering the "damn it give me a real 
              person" response we are now conditioned to. When it comes down 
              to it, it is very very hard to create a convincing, entertaining 
              synthetic character. If a talking head is meant to entertain us, 
              then fine, we will sit back and watch the theater (see http://<a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">www</a>.dotcomix.com 
              for some great examples of this). If however, we are trying to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> 
              for something, find an answer, or just get our work done, then I 
              predict that these automated personalities better come with quick 
              a "turn off" <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>. Sorry I am being so harsh on well 
              meaning, hard working technologists but does anyone remember (or 
              use) Microsoft Bob, Open Sesame or Mr. Paperclip from Microsoft 
              Office?</p>
<p>After all, younger minds engaged in multi-player gaming we mentioned 
              before (Everquest, Asheron's Call, Ultima Online, and Quake) treat 
              "non player characters" to the sword, rail gun or other 
              ignoble end. They are certainly going to have a "sub zero tolerance" 
              for attention soaking, slow speaking, lowest common denominator 
              talking heads. Hey, they get enough of this in the classroom!</p>
<h2><b>Other people believe that humans will be able to "upload" 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (even souls) into computers within 25 years and 
              that synthetic characters (bots) will be so compelling as to be 
              the indistinguishable from a living, breathing person, what is your 
              view on that?</b></h2>
<p>Well, yeah, so here is where I must diverge from the honorable 
              Mr. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> and other engineer's fascination with bots, agents, 
              synthespians and the like. People go online primarily to interact 
              with other people, and they are not easily fooled nor enticed to 
              spend time with automated personalities (they in fact feel cheated 
              of real interaction). I see in the current fascination with talking 
              heads a return of the old dream of "Grand AI", powered 
              by four generations of engineers' dreams to create the artificial 
              human, the fully developed synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. Hey, we have only vague 
              ideas of what <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is and how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works, and it is 
              likely you could not code human intelligence in a bottle, separated 
              from its total environment. Our best engineers also are not very 
              good at creating software (more on this later) so only in Hollywood 
              will we experience the enticing (or horrifying) visions of Grand 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<p>What I think is coming down the pipe, is what I call <i>Tiny AI</i> 
              which, in the form of bots and agents, are micro-intelligent prostheses 
              that augment reality, and extend the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> and reach of the human 
              mind and community communications. The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.digitalspace.com/papers/xelag-interview/xelag-interview.html" target="_blank">interview 
              of XelaG and his bots</a> illustrates perfectly the coming <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> 
              of personal Tiny AI. XelaG feels less present in a space without 
              Delph, VBird and Pal and they provide him numerous services and 
              support his presence in Cyberspace. I think an ethical issue will 
              arise in which people will demand to know when a Tiny AI is talking 
              and when a real person is interacting in real time. So my particular 
              vision is that a person will exist in cyberspace (which includes 
              the space of <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> devices) as an avatar embodying their real 
              time presence surrounded by a cloud of Tiny AIs which proxy them 
              into many processes and aspects of virtual community.</p>
<h2><b>What, you mean we won't be creating "Grand AI" any 
              time soon, why not?</b></h2>
<p>Well, it turns out as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.well.com/user/jaron/" target="_blank">Jaron 
              Lanier</a> (the guy who coined the term Virtual Reality) wrote recently 
              in his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier/lanier_index.html" target="_blank">Half 
              a Manifesto</a> that people are pretty bad at writing software. 
              It took 25 years for a competent networked graphical workstation 
              to make its way <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.damer.com/pictures/elixir/products/star.html" target="_blank">from 
              Xerox PARC to my house</a>. Just think about it, it took us decades 
              to create one competent, stable <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> operating system (have we done 
              it yet?). I, like Jaron, doubt whether applications of any sophistication 
              (that can truly learn or write their own extensions) will come about 
              within 25 years. However, software, the Internet and Cyberspace 
              holds tremendous power to extend the reach of human contact with 
              the world, other people, and even out into the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">Solar System</a>. Heck, 
              it is 2001 and we don't have anything close to Kubrick and Clark's

              significant.<i> Humans in the loop</i>, it was a good idea during 
              the MAD days of the cold war, and it is a safer bet now. How about 
              technology at the service of Humans (Tiny AI) and hopefully, to 
              help us keep ourselves from destroying the <a class="thought" href="entries/biosphere_entry.html">biosphere</a> and all that

              with XelaG and his bots here.</a></i></p>
<p>Yes indeedy, Tiny AIs do in fact exist now. In virtual world spaces 
              like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.activeworlds.com/" target="_blank">Active 
              Worlds</a>, thousands of them are running around there 24/7. A wonderful 
              example of the emerging bot-avatar-human <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> is a fellow known 
              as XelaG. XelaG lives in Holland, although he is originally from 
              Uruguay in South America. He is a seasoned <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer and also something 
              of a philosopher, a good story teller and a very interesting man. 
              XelaG is also no young chicken in the chatroom, he is around fifty 
              and has had a challenging life at times. </p>
<p>Several years ago, XelaG decided to create some alter egos, and 
              picked up his toolset to craft [Delph] (the "[]" brackets 
              are used to tell Delph from a real human), his first and most powerful 
              uber-bot. Working in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.activeworlds.com/" target="_blank">Active 
              Worlds</a> environment, XelaG and [Delph] and other bot foundries 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to create something of a revolution. For before the rise 
              of bots, to build in Active Worlds you had to stand in your avatar 
              at the building site and copy and move around objects in a laborious 
              lego-like process. XelaG, through untold hours of code-banging, 
              trained [Delph] to erect structures and take them down, to run slide 
              shows, to talk to big industrial strength <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s, to put on a 
              great game of trivia, and later, to direct a whole family of bots, 
              that would follow XelaG and [Delph] around. When XelaG was unable 
              to attend a virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> in a certain world, he would dispatch 
              [Delph] to listen in. [Delph] even orchestrated the grande finale 
              performance of the largest event in virtual world Cyberspace, the 
              annual Avatars cyberconference. For this, [Delph] dispatched a cloud 
              of huge pac-men bots to consume a stage and entire ring of the giant 
              Avatars2000 space station, leaving several hundred live attendees 
              in their unsuspecting avatars to fall through a mile long vortex 
              and into the "cosmic experience" (pictures and video can 
              be provided). By all accounts, this event, held on October 15th 
              of last year, was one of the most profound ever experienced by seasoned 
              citizenry of these early adopter worlds.</p>
<p>So how does XelaG describe his relationship to [Delph] and his 
              compadre bots? I <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316183613/http://www.digitalspace.com/papers/xelag-interview/xelag-interview.html" target="_blank">interviewed

              even when you are not there, if [Delph] and co are holding the fort? 
              XelaG: Yes, sort of... What I mostly feel is that there is a bit 
              of me missing when they are not there :)</p>
