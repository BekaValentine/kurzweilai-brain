<div class="TeaserText">With only 53,000 engineering graduates a year compared to Russia's 200,000, the U.S. needs to "communicate the importance of science in today&#8217;s world," Mikhail Gorbachev told Ray Kurzweil in a luncheon discussion that ranged from blogs to nuclear disarmament and longevity. </div>
<br>
<br>On April 12, 2005, Mikhail Gorbachev 
            delivered the keynote address at the annual Spring meeting of the 
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613225935/http://www.masoftware.org/" target="_blank">Massachusetts 
            Software Council</a> (MSC), of which I am a board member. He started 
            with reminiscences of his days as the last leader of the Soviet Union. 
            He recalled that his first impression of Ronald Reagan was that he 
            was a "dinosaur," and later heard that Reagan's first impression 
            of him was that Gorbachev was a "diehard Bolshevik." 
            <p>A few days after these negative first impression, however, their 
              relationship warmed, and this first Summit produced an arms control 
              agreement expressing for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the idea that nuclear war 
              can never be won and must never be fought. He referred to these 
              early efforts as bridges that were built to overcome decades of 
              distrust. The bridges now need renovation, and the remarkable <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> revolution is a key new bridge being built. </p>
<p>He reflected on the perestroika movement that he initiated. He 
              quoted a Chinese prime minister who was asked what the impact of 
              the French revolution had been on China, and responded "too 
              soon to tell." Similarly, we cannot yet judge perestroika, 
              but if he had to answer in a word whether it had won or lost, he 
              would say it had won. "The clock will not be turned back in 
              Russia. . . . We <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> we could solve many problems in a short 
              period of time. . .We freed Eastern Europe. . . We settled the animosity 
              with China with a new friendship. . .We built a new relationship 
              of cooperation with the United States."</p>
<p>He recalled how in 1986, he told the Communist Party Congress meeting 
              (his first as leader) that "we are living in an interdependent 
              and interrelated world." He said this was a new idea twenty 
              years ago, but is now an article of faith. It was ten years later, 
              in 1996, that he first heard the word "outsourcing" at 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> industry conference. He said that Russia 
              and Ukraine are benefiting from the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>'s ability to create 
              a single world <a class="thought" href="entries/information_economy_entry.html">information economy</a>, with a billion dollars of annual 
              information <a class="thought" href="entries/export_entry.html">export</a>s and a <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate of 50 percent. </p>
<p>For a more complete recollection of Gorbachev's keynote address, 
              see Dan Bricklin's excellent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613225935/http://danbricklin.com/log/gorbachev.htm" target="_blank">blog</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Gorbachev received a very enthusiastic standing ovation. There 
              was a private reception, and then a small private lunch. I was fortunate 
              to have the opportunity to sit next to Gorbachev and his long time 
              translator (Pavel Palazchenko). To my right was Dan Bricklin (creator 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/visicalc_entry.html">VisiCalc</a>, the first spreadsheet <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>), and to his right was 
              Gorbachev's daughter Irina who runs the Gorbachev Foundation. Also 
              sitting with us at the head table was John Cullinane (software industry 
              pioneer, cofounder of the MSC), Bob Metcalfe (<a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ethernet_entry.html">Ethernet</a>, 
              recent recipient of the <a class="thought" href="entries/national_medal_technology_entry.html">National Medal of Technology</a>), George Bell 
              (founder of uPromise, current Chairman of the MSC), Joyce Plotkin 
              (MSC President, who did an outstanding job organizing this historic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>), and Monster executives Jeff Taylor and Andy McKelvey. </p>
<p>Here is my recollection of some of our <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> during the 
              90-minute luncheon:</p>
<p><i><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></i>: You spoke about the role of the technology 
              revolution in building new bridges of understanding. I'm concerned 
              about the difficulty we're having in this country in attracting 
              our young people into technical careers. I've been gathering statistics 
              on this. Ten years ago, we had about 60,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering graduates 
              in the U.S. That figure is now around 53,000. In China, the comparable 
              figure ten years ago was about 10,000, a small fraction of the U.S., 
              but has now soared to over 300,000. There is a similar trend in 
              all scientific areas, and also at the doctoral level. India is much 
              the same. How is this going in Russia?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail Gorbachev</i>: The figure in Russia is over 200,000 
              engineering graduates per year.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: So, how are you accomplishing this?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> has always been an attraction for our talented 
              students. They understand its <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance in today's world, and they 
              value the hard work it represents. We need both engineering and 
              the liberal arts, and the waves of interest in these respectively 
              go up and down. </p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: How can we do better here?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: You have to communicate the importance of science 
              in today's world.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: You would think that would be obvious. I think the 
              leadership has to come from the top.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: Indeed.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: There was a spurt of interest in science careers in 
              the United States about four decades ago that your country was responsible 
              for. </p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: (smiling) Yes, today is the anniversary of Yuri 
              Gagarin's flight into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, the first person in outer space. We 
              were competitors then, now we work together. </p>
<p><i>Dan Bricklin</i>: What information technologies do you use?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: I use a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, a laptop, and the 
              Internet, but not <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a>. I do use the web a lot to get information, 
              but generally not <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s. There are newspapers in Russia 
              that are published only on the web, and that have excellent political 
              and social commentary. I read about a dozen of these.</p>
<p><i>Dan</i>: Kind of like blogs?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: They're not considered blogs, but they are similar. 
              The Internet has a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> in Russia, and much important 
              journalism and discussion takes place there. </p>
<p><i>Dan</i>: One of our commentators, Chris Daly, wrote recently 
              that blogs and online journalism play a similar role today as the 
              pamphlets of the United States revolutionary times.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: (smiling) Yes, very much so.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: It has been my view that the Internet is a major factor 
              in the democratization we've seen in the world over the past fifteen 
              years.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: That's a fair statement.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: My first book, which I wrote in the 1980s, while you 
              were President, talked about how the emerging decentralized <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> - fax <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, teletype-based email - would ultimately 
              foster democracy in the Soviet Union. </p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: It was a big factor, to be sure. But today, the 
              Internet also spreads hate.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: Yes, well, technology is always a double-edged sword. 
            </p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: We have to bring the benefits of technology to 
              everyone. The rich-poor divide is getting worse, and <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a> in 
              the world underlies much of the instability we see. </p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: A major source of instability is the rise of fundamentalism. 
              Fundamentalist leaders don't seem to come from the poor.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: The leaders, that's true. But the support and attraction 
              for fundamentalist and destructive movements is fueled by the despair 
              of poverty. </p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: There is a lot of attention - appropriate attention 
              to be sure - on nuclear disarmament, but surprising little attention 
              to the fact that the United States and Russia still have these enormous 
              stockpiles of thermonuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s that represent an existential 
              threat to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> survival. Despite the apparent friendship of Russia 
              and America, these stockpiles have not been reduced at all.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: Yes, it is a tragedy. The U.S. still has a doctrine 
              that allows for the possibility of use of these weapons. A new doctrine 
              is needed that would allow these weapons to be reduced.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: That would certainly move the world in a safer direction, 
              and also inspire the overall nuclear disarmament effort.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: Very much so. It would also be good if America 
              would agree to a comprehensive test ban treaty.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: You should discuss this with Putin and Bush.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: (smiling) Okay.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: How often do you talk with President Putin?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: We talk on occasion, and he listens to my ideas. 
              But he is, of course, an independent thinker and leader. He is a 
              strong supporter of free speech, which I personally benefit from.</p>
<p><i>Jeff Taylor</i>: What is your view of the Yukos affair?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: Well, people should pay their taxes.</p>
<p><i>Jeff</i>: Do you think the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s against Khodorkovsky were 
              politically motivated?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: Really, I don't. Too many powerful people in Russia 
              have not been paying their taxes, and this situation must be confronted. 
              Khodorkovsky did not make his money from the ground up the way, 
              say, <a class="thought" href="entries/gates_entry.html">Bill Gates</a> did. He was given the opportunity to take over a 
              public asset, which of course was legal and appropriate. But he 
              is obligated to pay the taxes he owes. The situation has some similarities 
              to your Enron affair. </p>
<p><i>Ray</i> (after giving Gorbachev an inscribed copy of my book, 
              Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever, coauthored with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/grossman_entry.html">Terry Grossman</a>, M.D.): Here's to your health, so that you can continue 
              to contribute to the world for many decades to come.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: (laughing) Oh I think it is too late for me.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: You are very active, no?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: Yes, I walk a great deal.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: That's my main exercise also. That's the best exercise.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: I enjoy an occasional vodka.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: Actually, we recommend moderate use of alcohol, it 
              appears to benefit longevity.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: (Smiling) Well, then, maybe I will live a long 
              time.</p>
<p><i>Ray</i>: I would bet on it. </p>
<p><i>Dan</i>: As someone who has changed the world, what advice would 
              you give to kids today who want to change the world?</p>
<p><i>Mikhail</i>: My advice would be to have a dialogue with people, 
              to help overcome prejudice, to build bridges of understanding. </p>
<p><i>Mikhail's first toast</i>: I'd like to toast the Massachusetts 
              Software Council and everyone who made this event possible, with 
              thanks for your warmth and hospitality. </p>
<p><i>Mikhail's second toast</i>: To the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> success of the Russian 
              and American information industries.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail's third toast</i>: It is a tradition in our country 
              that the third toast is always for the women. So, to the health 
              of all the lovely women here at the luncheon.</p>
<p><i>Mikhail's fourth toast</i>: Only monks and nuns do their <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              alone. We need to communicate our thoughts and work together. </p>
<p>At the end of the lunch, Gorbachev gave warm bear hugs to Dan Bricklin, 
              Joyce Plotkin, and myself, which was an unexpected treat.</p>

Talks about the numbers of thousands of engineers or professionals are very old-fashioned soviet style thinking in my view.  Under that mindset society could be centrally stage managed by a handful of elite beurocrats.  The history of the former soviet union, and similar totalitarian regimes, shows just how untennable that approach is.  It's not how many engineers you've got, its their quality that matters.  Often a single brilliant engineer is worth a hundred moderately competent pen-pushers.</p></td>

There's going to be a die-off in the human species because of overpopulation and PLUTOCRACY.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This is a recurring theme in the discussions about "Singularity." I guess this is as good a place as any to posit and pontificate...
<br>
<br>
Of course, it is assumed that everyone, given good mental and physical health, would opt to live forever if given the chance.
<br>
<br>
I'm about half-way through Kurzweil's latest book and it seems, however, that this inevitability is treated too lightly. I haven't gotten to Peril and Promise yet, but his views on immortality strike me as too sanguine. 
<br>
<br>
First, death has been to this point a sine qua non of evolution, the ultimate change agent. Taking this out of the equation is qualitatively much different than the other developments en route to the Singularity.
<br>
<br>
As Aristophenes once said, "Eventually there is too much in life: too much sunsets, too much love, too much cabbage." Even with the prodigious intellects promised, is there any guarantee that we will not wish for death out of the sheer banality of existence? It may be poetic gibberish, but can there be some true to it, that if death can be infinitely postponed the experiences that consitute life assume infinitesimal importance and meaning?
<br>
<br>
Underlying the belief of immortality is the obvious narcissism. It isn't much comfort to consider that the only thing that could interest an astronomically advanced intelligence is itself. After all, if a modern human brain is closer in intelligence to a rock than to the "ultimate laptop," that means we can be interested in a lot of things in the same logarithmic vicinity as well as beyond. If you're the smartest thing out there, there's not much else more interesting than you. Could this mindset not be as corrupting on a super-intelligent being as on a conceited high school cheerleader?
<br>
<br>
BTW: I'm sure someone here has read a sci-fi book in which this premise is explored. Basically it argues that immortality is ultimately unbearable banal. Was it asimov?
<br>
<br>
I just think, once we're given the option of immortality, there will be a lot of initial takers but eventually most will leave it. Except perhaps the pathological ones, in which case I fall into the "Peril" camp with Bill Joy and Kackzinski.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
I saw Gorbachev speak, and he's still a central-planning socialist.  He didn't support privatizing Soviet industry, and his  class-warfare mentality and focus on production quotas (of state education) rather than freedom and innovation demonstrates his cluelessness.  That and his support of Putin's bloody dictatorship is reason enough not waste gobs of money on the nonsense of a Cold War relic.
<br>
<br>
By the way, Russia's 200,000 engineering quota is entirely illusory.  Russian students go to college to avoid the military draft, and because universities pay students a better salary than can be found in the economy Putin screwed up.  The technical education they receive is so primitive and outdated as to be worthless.  </p></td>
