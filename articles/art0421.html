<br><h1>Reference Notes</h1><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><p>1. W. B. Kannel W. P. Castelli, and T. Gordon, "Cholesterol in the Prediction of Atherosclerotic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a>. New Perspectives Based on the Framingham Study, "Annals of Internal <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> 90 (Jan. 1979): 85-91.</p>
<p>T. Gordon et al., "Diabetes, Blood lipids, and the Role of Obesity in Coronary Heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a> Risk for Women: The Framingham Study," Annals of Internal <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> 87 (Oct 1970:393-97. One of the first conclusions of The Framingham Study is that the risk of coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> is "strikingly related to the serum total cholesterol level. Within so-called normal limits, risk has been found to mount over a fivefold range."</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis of the Framingham data revealed that an even more reliable estimate of coronary risk could be obtained by considering the ratio of the total serum cholesterol to the HDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>Let X =total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol</p>
<p>Risk for men = 1.357 Ln X - 1.1875</p>
<p>(note Ln is natural logarithm, i.e., logarithm base e)</p>
<p>3.125 Log X - 1.1875</p>
<p>(note Log is logarithm base 10)</p>
<p>Risk for women a 2.069 In X - 2.042</p>
<p>4.766 Log X - 2.042</p>
<p>Note that The two formulas for men give the same answer, as do the two formulas for women.</p>
<p>The risk derived from the above formula is expressed as a multiple of "average" risk.</p>
<p>For example, if a male has a total cholesterol of 180 and an HDL of 60, then X (the cholesterol-HDL ratio)- 3. The risk -.30, which means this person has 30 percent of The average risk for coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. This figure may then be subsequently adjusted for other risk factors, such as obesity, type 11 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking, etc.</p>
<p>The graph on the following page shows the risk (Y) (expressed as a multiple of average American risk) as a function of The total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio for both men and women.</p>

<p>Approximately 40 percent of all Americans die from heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. Of those who die from other causes (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>), more than half have had a previous heart attack. Interestingly, not all of these heart attacks are diagnosed. Autopsies often reveal evidence of ischemic damage (damage to the heart muscle resulting from deficiency of Wood due to diminished arterial flow) caused by a previously undiagnosed heart attack in patients who succumb to other diseases.</p>

A veritable encyclopedia of nutrition and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, this comprehensive volume is an informative and scholarly guide for the researcher and layperson alike. In addition tome plethora of material contained in the text, an exhaustive array of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is cited.</p>
<p>2. I. Romieu et ad., "<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Intake and Other Determinants of Relative Weight," American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 47 (1988): 406-12. The results of this study suggest that weight gain is not dependent on <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a> intake alone. Fat calories are more fattening than other calories because the body is able to store the fat calories more efficiently, leaving more calories to be stored in the body's tissues to contribute to weight gain.</p>
<p>Another study with similar findings and some interesting discussion on the subject is D. M. Dreon et al., "Dietary Fat Carbohydrate Ratio and Obesity in Middle Aged Men," American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 47 (1988):996-1000. Background support for these findings can be found in L. Lissner, "Dietary Fat and the Regulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Intake in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Subjects," American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 46 (1980:886-92. The Lissner study suggests that reducing <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a> intake may not be the best approach to weight loss because of <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a> deficits. Rather, decreasing the amount of fat in the diet allows individuals to eat more, induces spontaneous weight loss, and may be more readily incorporated into an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>'s life-style.</p>
<p>The following study also supports efforts to alter food selection rather than limiting food intake in weight loss by comparing the effects of high- and low-fat diets, caloric intake, and eating time among obese and non obese individuals: K H. Duncan, J. A Bacon, and R. L Weinsler, "The Effects of High-and Low <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Density Diets on Satiety, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Intake, and Eating <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> of Obese and Non obese Subjects, "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 37 (May 1983):763-87. Among the findings was that subjects on the low-fat diets were able to reach their satiety point by consuming only about one-half the calories of those on the high-fat diets.</p>

Beginning with a thorough and informative discussion on the epidemiological link between diet and coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, the critical role of diet in the development of heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> is emphasized.

In conclusion, the authors discuss the limitations of conventional medical treatment and recommend treating coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> patients with low-fat diets aimed at lowering cholesterol to threshold levels(where heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> is virtually unheard of).</p>

This is Ancel Key's opus, the culmination of a ten- year study as well as a long professional career dating back to the late 1940s. Keys, a pioneer in the field, masterminded the renowned Seven Countries Study, which was unprecedented in its scope. Involving seven countries (comprising of sixteen cohorts) over the span often years, it was the first study to compare the epidemiology of heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> in different countries. The outcome of the Seven Countries Study provided a foundation for many contemporary studies-it is rare to find a study on the epidemiology of heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> that does not cite Keys's classic work. The 1990 study in China (see n. 23, below) is perhaps the only study since Seven Countries to otter such rich evidence on die patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and diet.

A particularly interesting finding of this study is that cheese, unlike other dairy products, is not closely related to the <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> rate of ischemic heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>-perhaps because cheese contains a high level of calcium, which inhibits the absorption of saturated fatty acids.</p>

This autopsy study provides clear evidence that the significant majority (77 percent) of young (22-year-old) American males autopsied had significant atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a progressive condition, and the percentage of Americans with it(on the order of 77 percent of American males by age 22) will significantly increase with age.</p>
<p>Another indication of the prevalence of atherosclerosis is the incidence of heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> among all Americans (male and <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a>), the vast majority of which is linked to atherosclerosis. Half of all Americans (he from heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and related complications.</p>
<p>The average American has a 75 percent chance of having a heart attack during his or her lifetime (see introduction, n.2, above),indicating an advanced stage of atherosclerosis at the time of such event. A significant fraction of the 25 percent of Americans who will not have experienced a heart attack at the time of their death nonetheless have some level of atherosclerosis; they will have died from other causes (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>) prior to having their atherosclerosis advance sufficiently to cause an acute atherosclerosis-triggered event On the basis of these observations, an estimate that 90 percent of Americans have at least some level of atherosclerosis appears reasonable.</p>

<p>22. Enos, Beyer, and Holmes (see n.8, above).This is an important autopsy study offering clear-cut evidence that atherosclerosis starts at an early age in the vast majority of American males. Autopsy findings from Japanese males of comparable age are cited for comparison since they reveal little or no evidence of coronary occlusion. The authors conclude that diet, as it affects the cholesterol levels in the blood, is an important factor in the development of coronary <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> in young males.</p>

During a seven-year follow-up of men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> analysis revealed that there was a significant correlation between <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and low levels of cholesterol in subjects who died in the early years of the study. However, those subjects who died of <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> in later years of the study did not have significantly lower cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study.</p>
<p>The authors of this study conclude that the subjects with low cholesterol at the beginning of the study actually had preclinical <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> since they developed <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> within a few years of the low cholesterol reading.

High-fat diets lead to elevated lipid levels, which results in lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> (hypoxia) in muscle tissues, most notably the brain (see n.18, above).As noted previously, the Dustman study found that by increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> availability through exercise, not only did subjects show improved cognitive ability, but their visual sensitivity (visual threshold and field) was also increased. Thus, the degenerative effects of hypoxia, including a reduced visual field, may be avoided by adhering to a low-fat diet and by exercising.</p>

<p>45. Clarkson et al. (see chap. 2, n. 7, above). In studying the effects of diet and stress on the development of coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> in monkeys, Clarkson et al. found that monkeys fed a high-fat diet and exposed to a high-stress environment were more than thirty times as likely to develop advanced atherosclerosis as high-stress monkeys consuming a low-fat diet. Findings also revealed that stress influenced the development of minimal atherosclerosis in monkeys on the low-fat diet but these cases of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> were much less advanced, indicating that stress can be harmful independent of dietary factors but not nearly as harmful as stress combined with a high-fat diet.

<p>23. Although Benson derived his technique largely from transcendental <a class="thought" href="entries/meditation_entry.html">meditation</a> (TM), proponents of TM point out that Benson's technique is not the same as TM and differs from it in subtle, but important, ways. There has been extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> reported on the health benefits of TM, which includes papers in over one hundred referenced journals.

<p>35-38. Caloric restriction has been shown to inhibit the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of spontaneous, transplanted, or chemically induced tumors in rats and mice. At 40 percent caloric restriction, <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of chemically induced breast and colon tumors was significantly inhibited. Exercise has also been shown to inhibit tumor <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>. Sedentary rats who were allowed to eat freely had 108 percent higher incidence of induced colon tumors than free-eating rats subjected to vigorous treadmill exercise.</p>
