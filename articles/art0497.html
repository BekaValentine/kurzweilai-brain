<h2>Tender-Minded <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">Materialism</a> </h2>
<p></p>
<p>The question of whether humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s has been vigorously 
              debated over the last two hundred years. The French materialists 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a> like Pierre Cabanis, Julien La Mettrie, and 
              Baron d&#8217;Holbach affirmed that humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (La Mettrie 
              even wrote a book titled Man the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>). Likewise contemporary 
              materialists like <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/dennett_entry.html">Daniel Dennet</a>t, and Patricia Churchland 
              see the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s and modifications of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> as sufficient to account 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mentality. For all its faults, <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> is a predictable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>. If <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is all there is, then <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> must, in some fashion, 
              reduce to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Whereas <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a> philosophes might have 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of humans in terms of gear mechanisms and fluid flows, contemporary 
              materialists think of humans in terms of neurological <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. The idiom has been updated, but the underlying 
              impulse to reduce <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> remains unchanged. </p>
<p>If predictability is <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>&#8217;s main virtue, then hollowness 
              is its main fault. Humans have aspirations. We long for <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>, and the beatific vision. We are restless until we find 
              our rest in <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. The problem for the materialist, however, is that 
              these aspirations cannot be redeemed in the coin of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Our 
              aspirations are, after all, <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual (etymology confirms this point&#8212;&#8220;aspiration&#8221; 
              and &#8220;spiritual&#8221; are cognates). We need to transcend ourselves 
              to find ourselves. Now the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s and modifications of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> offer 
              no opportunity for transcending ourselves. Materialists in times 
              past admitted as much. Freud saw belief in <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> as wish-fulfillment. 
              Marx saw <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> as an opiate. Nietzsche saw Christianity as a 
              pathetic excuse for mediocrity. Each regarded the hope for <a class="thought" href="entries/transcendence_entry.html">transcendence</a> 
              as a delusion. </p>
<p>This hope, however, is not easily excised from the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> heart. 
              Even the most hardened materialist shudders at Bertrand Russell&#8217;s 
              vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> destiny: &#8220;Man is the product of causes which 
              had no prevision of the end they were achieving&#8221; and which 
              predestine him &#8220;to <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> in the vast <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of the solar 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.&#8221; The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> heart longs for more. And in an age when 
              having it all has become de rigueur, enjoying the benefits of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> 
              without its ontological burdens is now within reach. The erstwhile 
              impossible marriage between <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> is now 
              routinely consummated. The vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.S. Lewis&#8217; devilish character 
              Screwtape&#8212;the &#8220;materialist magician&#8221; who combines 
              the skepticism of the materialist with the cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              of the mystic&#8212;is here at last. </p>
<p>Within the tough-minded <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> of the past, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> aspirations, 
              whatever else they might be, were strictly finite and terminated 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>. The tough-minded <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> of 
              the past was strong, stark, and courageous. It embraced the void, 
              and disdained any impulse to pie in the sky. Not so the tender-minded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> of our age. Though firmly committed to <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>, 
              it is just as firmly committed to not missing out on any benefits 
              ascribed to religious <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> is now 
              possible, and with it comes the view that we are <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              The juxtaposition of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> and mechanism, which previously would 
              have been regarded as an oxymoron, is now said to constitute a profound 
              insight.</p>
<p>As evidence for this move from tough- to tender-minded <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>, 
              consider <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>&#8217;s recently published The Age of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s: When <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s Exceed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>. Kurzweil is 
              a leader in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, and specifically in the field 
              of voice-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Ten years ago Kurzweil published 
              the more modestly titled The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a> (MIT, 1990). 
              There he gave the usual strong <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> position 
              about <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> being functionally equivalent. 
              In The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, however, Kurzweil&#8217;s aim is 
              no longer to show that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are merely capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capacities. 
              Rather, his aim is to show that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are capable of vastly outstripping 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capacities and will do so within the next thirty years. </p>
<p>According to The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is the next great step in the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. That the 
              highest form of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> happens for now to be embodied in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              beings is simply an accident of natural <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> beings need 
              to be transcended, though not by going beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, but by reinstantiating 
              themselves in more efficient forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, to wit, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              Kurzweil claims that in the next thirty or so years we shall be 
              able to scan our brains, upload them onto a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and thereafter 
              continue our lives as virtual persons running as <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s on <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              Since the storage and processing capacities of these virtual persons 
              will far exceed that of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, they will quickly take 
              the lead in all aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. Those humans who refuse to upload 
              themselves will be left in the dust, becoming &#8220;pets,&#8221; 
              as Kurzweil puts it, of the newly evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s. 
              What&#8217;s more, these <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s will be conditionally 
              immortal, depending for their continued <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> only on the ability 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> to run the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. </p>
<p>Although Kurzweil is at pains to shock his readers with the imminence 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> takeover, he is hardly alone in seeking <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Frank Tipler&#8217;s The <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a> 
              (Doubleday, 1994) is devoted entirely to this topic. Freeman Dyson 
              has pondered it as well. <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>, one of the founders of modern 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, was fascinated with how the distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> illuminated <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. Turing&#8217;s friend Christopher 
              Morcom had died when they were teenagers. If Morcom&#8217;s continued 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> depended on his particular embodiment, then he was gone 
              for good. But if he could be instantiated as a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>), Morcom&#8217;s particular embodiment (<a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>) would 
              be largely irrelevant. Identifying personal <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> thus ensured that people were immortal since even though 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> could be destroyed, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> resided in a realm of mathematical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> and was thus immune to destruction. </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Humans as <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A strong case can be made that humans are not <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8212;period. 
              I shall make that case later in this essay. Assuming that I am right 
              and that humans are not <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, it follows that humans are not 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Even so, the question what it would mean for 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to be <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual is interesting in its own right. My immediate 
              aim, therefore, is not to refute the claim that humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but to show what modifying &#8220;machine&#8221; with the 
              adjective &#8220;spiritual&#8221; entails. I shall argue that attributing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s entails an impoverished form of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>. 
              It&#8217;s rather like talking about &#8220;free prisoners.&#8221; 
              Whatever else <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> might mean here, it doesn&#8217;t mean <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> 
              to leave the prison. </p>
<p>To see what modifying &#8220;machine&#8221; with the adjective &#8220;spiritual&#8221; 
              entails, let us start by examining what we mean by a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Normally 
              by a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> we mean an integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of parts that function 
              together to accomplish some purpose. To avoid the troubled waters 
              of teleology, let us bracket the question of purpose. In that case 
              we can define a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> as any integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of parts whose 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s and modifications entirely characterize the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Implicit 
              in this definition is that all the parts are physical. Consequently 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is fully determined by the constitution, <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a>, and 
              interrelationships of its physical parts. </p>
<p>This definition is very general. It incorporates <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s as well 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s (humans being a case in point). Because the nineteenth 
              century Romanticism that separates <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s is still 
              with us, many people shy away from calling <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. But 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are as much integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of physical parts as are 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s. Perhaps &#8220;integrated physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s&#8221; 
              would be more precise, but &#8220;machines&#8221; stresses the strict 
              absence of extra-material factors from such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and it is that 
              absence which is the point of controversy.</p>
<p>With this definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in hand, let us now consider what 
              it means to ascribe <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Because <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are 
              integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of parts, they are subject to what I call the 
              replacement principle. What this means is that physically indistinguishable 
              parts of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can be exchanged without altering the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. 
              At the <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> level, <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s in the same quantum state can 
              be exchanged without altering the <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. At the biochemical 
              level, polynucleotides with the same length and sequence specificity 
              can be exchanged without altering the biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. At the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al level, identical organs can be exchanged without altering 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. At the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> contrivances, identical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s can be exchanged without altering the contrivance. </p>
<p>The replacement principle is relevant to this discussion because 
              it implies that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have no substantive <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. According 
              to Hilaire Belloc, &#8220;To comprehend the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of a thing is 
              to unlock the mysteries of its present, and more, to disclose the 
              profundities of its <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.&#8221; But a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, properly speaking, 
              has no <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is a superfluous rider&#8212;an addendum 
              that could easily have been different without altering the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. 
              If something is solely a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, then according to the replacement 
              principle it and a replica are identical. Forgeries of the present 
              become masterpieces of the past if the forgeries are good enough. 
              This may not be a problem for <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> dealers, but it does become a 
              problem when the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in question are ourselves (cf. <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>s that &#224; la <a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a> could assemble and diassemble 
              us <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>). </p>
<p>For a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, all that it is, is what it is at this moment. We 
              typically think of our memories as either remembered or forgotten, 
              and if forgotten then having the possibility of recovery. But <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              do not properly speaking remember or forget (remembering and forgetting 
              being substantive relations between a person and a person&#8217;s 
              actual past). <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> or fail to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> items in storage. 
              What&#8217;s more, if they fail to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> an item, it&#8217;s either 
              because the retrieval mechanism failed or because the item was erased. 
              Consequently, items that represent past occurrences but were later 
              erased are, as far as the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is concerned, just as though they 
              never happened. Mutatis mutandis, items that represent counterfactual 
              occurrences (i.e., things that never happened) but which are <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible 
              can be, as far as the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is concerned, just as though they 
              did happen. </p>
<p>The causal <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> leading up to a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is strictly an accidental 
              feature of it. Consequently, any dispositional properties we ascribe 
              to a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (e.g., goodness, morality, virtue, and yes, even <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>) 
              properly pertain only to its current state and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> potentialities, 
              and can be detached from its past. In particular, any defect in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> relates only to its current state and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> potentialities. 
              Moreover, the correction of any defect properly belongs to <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that was a mass-murderer yesterday may become an angel 
              of mercy today provided we can find a suitable readjustment of its 
              parts. Having come to view ourselves as <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, it is no accident 
              that our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> looks for salvation in technologies like behavior 
              modification, <a class="thought" href="entries/psychotropic_entry.html">psychotropic</a> drugs, cognitive reprogramming, and genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. </p>
<p>The problem with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s is that they are incapable of sustaining 
              what philosophers call substantial forms. A substantial form is 
              a principle of unity that holds a thing together and maintains its 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s lack substantial forms. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, 
              though having a past, might just as well not have had a past. A 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, though configured in one way, could just as well be reconfigured 
              in other ways. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8217;s defects can be corrected and its 
              virtues improved through <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Alternatively, new defects 
              can be introduced and old virtues removed through <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. What 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is now and what it might end up in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> are entirely 
              open-ended and discontinuous. Despite the buffeting of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, 
              substantial forms perdure through <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s, on the other hand, 
              are the subject of endless tinkering and need bear no semblance 
              to past incarnations. </p>
<p>In this <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> consider the various possible meanings of &#8220;spiritual&#8221; 
              in combination with &#8220;machine.&#8221; Since a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is entirely 
              characterized in terms of the constitution, <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a>, and interrelationships 
              of its physical parts, &#8220;spiritual&#8221; cannot refer to some 
              nonphysical aspect of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Let&#8217;s therefore restrict 
              &#8220;spiritual&#8221; to some physical aspect of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. What, 
              then, might it refer to? Often when we think of someone as <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual, 
              we think of that person as exhibiting some moral virtue like self-sacrifice, 
              altruism, or courage. But we only <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> such virtues on the 
              basis of past <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. Yet past <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s belong to <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              is what <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s don&#8217;t have, except accidentally. </p>
<p>Consider, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, a possible-worlds scenario featuring an 
              ax murderer who just prior to his <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> has a cerebral accident 
              that turns his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> state into that of Mother Teresa&#8217;s at 
              her most charitable. The ax murderer now has the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> state of 
              a saint but the past of a sinner. Assuming the ax murderer is a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, is he now a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>? Suppose Mother Teresa has 
              a cerebral accident just prior to her <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> that turns her <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              state into that of the ax murderer&#8217;s at his most barbaric. 
              Mother Teresa now has the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> state of a sinner but the past of 
              a saint. Assuming Mother Teresa is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, is she no longer a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>? </p>
<p>Such counterfactuals indicate the futility of attributing <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on the basis of past <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s that have functioned 
              badly in the past are not sinners and therefore unspiritual. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s 
              that have functioned well in the past are not saints and therefore 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s that have functioned badly in the past need 
              to be fixed. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s that have functioned well in the past need 
              to be kept in good working <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> so that they continue to function 
              well. Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has been fixed, it doesn&#8217;t <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how 
              badly it functioned in the past. On the other hand, once a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              goes haywire, it doesn&#8217;t <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how well it functioned in the 
              past. </p>
<p>Attributing <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on the basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s 
              is equally problematic. Clearly, we have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> only through its present. Given its present constitution, 
              can we predict what the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will do in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? The best 
              we can do is specify certain behavioral propensities. But even with 
              the best propensities, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s break and malfunction. It is impossible 
              to predict the full range of stresses that a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> may encounter 
              and that may cause it to break or malfunction. Consequently it is 
              impossible to tell whether a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that gives all appearances 
              of functioning one way will continue to function that way. For every 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in a given state there are circumstances sure to lead to 
              its undoing. Calling a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> &#8220;spiritual&#8221; in reference 
              to its <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> can therefore only refer to certain propensities of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to function in certain ways. But <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> of this 
              sort is better left to a bookmaker than to a priest or <a class="thought" href="entries/guru_entry.html">guru</a>. </p>
<p>Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed through its present, 
              it follows that attributing <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s properly refers 
              to some present physical aspect of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. But what aspect 
              might this be? What about the constitution, <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a>, and interrelationships 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8217;s parts renders it <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual? What emergent property 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of physical parts corresponds to <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>? Suppose 
              humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Does an ecstatic religious <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, an <a class="thought" href="entries/lsd_entry.html">LSD</a> 
              drug trip, a Maslow peak <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, or a period of silence, prayer, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/meditation_entry.html">meditation</a> count as a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>? I suppose if we 
              are playing a Wittgensteinian <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> game, this usage is okay. 
              But however we choose to classify these <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s, it remains 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> is the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> of immediate <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              This is of course consistent with much of contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>, 
              which places a premium on religious <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> and neglects such 
              traditional aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> as revelation, tradition, virtue, 
              morality, and above all communion with a nonphysical <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> who transcends 
              our physical being. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> neglects much that has traditionally been 
              classified under <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>. From this alone it would follow that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> is an impoverished form of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>. But 
              the problem is worse. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> fails on its own terms 
              as a phenomenology of religious <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is necessarily poorer than the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              of a being that communes with <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. The entire emphasis of Judeo-Christian 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> is on communion with a free personal transcendent <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> 
              (cf. Diogenes Allen&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual Theology, Cowley Publications, 
              1997). Moreover, communion with <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> always presupposes a free act 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> to commune with us. <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">Freedom</a> here means that <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> can refuse 
              to commune with us (to, as the Scriptures say, &#8220;hide his face&#8221;). 
              Thus, within traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> we are aware of God&#8217;s 
              presence because <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> has freely chosen to make his presence known 
              to us. Truly <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual persons&#8212;or saints as they are called&#8212;experience 
              a constant, habitual awareness of God&#8217;s presence. </p>
<p>But how can a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> be aware of God&#8217;s presence? Recall that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are entirely defined by the constitution, <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a>, and 
              interrelationships among their physical parts. It follows that <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> 
              cannot make his presence known to a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> by acting upon it and 
              thereby changing its state. Indeed, the moment <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> acts upon a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              to change its state, it no longer properly is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, for an 
              aspect of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> now transcends its physical constituents. 
              It follows that awareness of God&#8217;s presence by a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> must 
              be independent of any <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> to change the state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. 
              How then does the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> come to awareness of God&#8217;s presence? 
              The awareness must be self-induced. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> is the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> of self-realization, not the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> of an active 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> who freely gives himself in self-revelation and thereby transforms 
              the beings with which he is in communion. For Kurzweil to modify 
              &#8220;machine&#8221; with the adjective &#8220;spiritual&#8221; therefore 
              entails an impoverished view of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>.</p>

<h2>Accounting for Intelligent Agency </h2>
<p></p>
<p>The question remains whether humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (with or without 
              the adjective &#8220;spiritual&#8221; tacked in front). To answer 
              this question, we need first to examine how <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> understands 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> agency and, more generally, intelligent agency. Although the 
              materialist literature that attempts to account for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> agency 
              is vast, the materialist&#8217;s options are in fact quite limited. 
              The materialist world is not a <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>-first world. Intelligent agency 
              is therefore in no <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> prior to or independent of the material 
              world. Intelligent agency is a derivative mode of causation that 
              depends on underlying natural&#8212;and therefore unintelligent&#8212;causes. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> agency in particular supervenes on underlying natural processes, 
              which in turn usually are identified with <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> function. </p>
<p>How well have natural processes been able to account for intelligent 
              agency? Cognitive scientists have achieved nothing like a full <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>. 
              The French Enlightenment thinker Pierre Cabanis remarked: &#8220;Les 
              nerfs&#8212;voil&#224; tout l&#8217;homme&#8221; (the nerves&#8212;that&#8217;s 
              all there is to man). A full <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent agency to 
              natural causes would give a complete account of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior, 
              intention, and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> in terms of neural processes. Nothing like 
              this has been achieved. No doubt, neural processes are correlated 
              with behavior, intention, and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>. But correlation is not causation.</p>
<p>Anger presumably is correlated with certain localized <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations. 
              But localized <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations hardly explain anger any better 
              than overt behaviors associated with anger, like shouting obscenities. 
              Localized <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations may be reliably correlated with anger, 
              but what accounts for one person interpreting a comment as an insult 
              and experiencing anger, and another person interpreting that same 
              comment as a <a class="thought" href="entries/joke_entry.html">joke</a> and experiencing laughter? A full materialist 
              account of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> needs to understand localized <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations 
              in terms of other localized <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations. Instead we find localized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations (representing, say, anger) having to be explained 
              in terms of semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s (representing, say, insults). But 
              this mixture of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> excitations and semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s hardly constitutes 
              a materialist account of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> or intelligent agency. </p>
<p>Lacking a full <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent agency to natural processes, 
              cognitive scientists speak of intelligent agency as supervening 
              on natural processes. Supervenience is a hierarchical relationship 
              between higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> processes (in this case intelligent agency) 
              and lower <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> processes (in this case natural processes). What 
              supervenience says is that the relationship between the higher and 
              lower <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> processes is a one-way street, with the lower determining 
              the higher. To say, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, that intelligent agency supervenes 
              on neurophysiology is to say that once all the facts about neurophysiology 
              are in place, all the facts about intelligent agency are determined 
              as well. Supervenience makes no pretense at reductive analysis. 
              It simply asserts that the lower level determines the higher level&#8212;how 
              it does it, we don&#8217;t know. </p>
<p>Certainly, if we knew that <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> were correct, then supervenience 
              would follow. But <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> itself is at issue. <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">Neuroscience</a>, 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, is nowhere near underwriting <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>, and that 
              despite its strident rhetoric. Hardcore neuroscientists, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, 
              refer disparagingly to the ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> of beliefs, desires, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s as &#8220;folk <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>.&#8221; The implication is 
              that just as &#8220;folk <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>&#8221; had to give way to &#8220;real 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>,&#8221; so &#8220;folk <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>&#8221; will have to give 
              way to a revamped <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> that is grounded in <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a>. In 
              place of talking cures that address our beliefs, desires, and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, 
              tomorrow&#8217;s healers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> will manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> states 
              directly and ignore such outdated categories as beliefs, desires, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s. </p>
<p>At least so the story goes. Actual <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is by 
              contrast a much more modest affair and fails to support <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>&#8217;s 
              vaulting ambitions. That should hardly surprise us. The neurophysiology 
              of our brains is incredibly plastic and has proven notoriously difficult 
              to correlate with intentional states. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, Louis Pasteur, 
              despite suffering a cerebral accident, continued to enjoy a flourishing 
              scientific career. When his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> was examined after he died, it 
              was discovered that half the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> had atrophied. How does one explain 
              a flourishing intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> despite a severely damaged <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              if <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> coincide?</p>
<p>Or consider a more striking example. The December 12, 1980 issue 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> contained an article by Roger Lewin titled &#8220;Is Your 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> Really Necessary?&#8221; In the article, Lewin reported a case 
              study by John Lorber, a British neurologist and professor at Sheffield 
              University:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;There&#8217;s a young student at this university,&#8221; 
              says Lorber, &#8220;who has an <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> of 126, has gained a first-class 
              honors degree in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, and is socially completely normal. 
              And yet the boy has virtually no <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#8221; The student&#8217;s 
              physician at the university noticed that the youth had a slightly 
              larger than normal head, and so referred him to Lorber, simply out 
              of interest. &#8220;When we did a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a> on him,&#8221; Lorber 
              recalls, &#8220;we saw that instead of the normal 4.5-centimeter 
              thickness of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> tissue between the ventricles and the cortical 
              surface, there was just a thin layer of mantle measuring a millimeter 
              or so. His cranium is filled mainly with cerebrospinal fluid.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Against such anomalies, Cabanis&#8217;s dictum, &#8220;the nerves&#8212;that&#8217;s 
              all there is to man,&#8221; hardly inspires confidence. Yet, as Thomas 
              Kuhn has taught us, a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> that is <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ing fast and furiously 
              is not about to be derailed by a few anomalies. <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">Neuroscience</a> is 
              a case in point. For all the obstacles it faces in trying to reduce 
              intelligent agency to natural causes, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a> persists in the 
              Promethean determination to show that <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> does ultimately reduce 
              to neurophysiology. Absent a prior commitment to <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>, this 
              determination will seem misguided. On the other hand, given a prior 
              commitment to <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>, this determination becomes readily understandable. 
            </p>
<p>Understandable yes, obligatory no. Most cognitive scientists do 
              not rest their hopes with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a>. Yes, if <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> is correct, 
              then a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent agency to neurophysiology is in 
              principle possible. The sheer difficulty of even attempting this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>, both <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al and theoretical, however, leaves many 
              cognitive scientists looking for a more manageable field to invest 
              their energies. As it turns out, the field of choice is <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, and especially its subdiscipline of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. 
              Unlike brains, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are neat and precise. Also, unlike brains, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and their <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s can be copied and mass-produced. Inasmuch 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> thrives on replicability and control, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> 
              offers tremendous practical advantages over neurological <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>.</p>
<p>Whereas the goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a> is to reduce intelligent agency 
              to neurophysiology, the goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is to reduce 
              intelligent agency to <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> by producing a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              that equals, or if we are to believe <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, exceeds <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Since <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s operate deterministically, reducing 
              intelligent agency to <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> would indeed constitute a materialistic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent agency. Should <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              succeed in reducing intelligent agency to <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, cognitive 
              scientists would still have the task of showing in what <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              function is <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al (that is, <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>&#8217;s dictum 
              &#8220;the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> made of meat&#8221; would still need 
              to be verified). Even so, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent agency to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> would go a long way toward establishing a purely materialist 
              basis for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognition.</p>
<p>An obvious question now arises: Can <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> explain intelligent 
              agency? First off, let&#8217;s be clear that no actual <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              has come anywhere near to simulating the full range of capacities 
              we associate with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intelligent agency. Yes, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can do 
              certain narrowly circumscribed tasks exceedingly well (like play 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>). But require a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to make a decision based on incomplete 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and calling for <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will 
              be lost. Perhaps the toughest problem facing <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers is what&#8217;s called the frame problem. The frame problem 
              is getting a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to find the appropriate frame of reference 
              for solving a problem.</p>
<p>Consider, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the following story: A man enters a bar. 
              The bartender asks, &#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221; The man responds, 
              &#8220;I&#8217;d like a glass of water.&#8221; The bartender pulls 
              out a gun and shouts, &#8220;Get out of here!&#8221; The man says 
              &#8220;thank you&#8221; and leaves. End of story. What is the appropriate 
              frame of reference? No, this isn&#8217;t a story by Franz Kafka. 
              The key item of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> needed to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of this story is 
              this: The man has the hiccups. By going to the bar to get a drink 
              of water, the man hoped to cure his hiccups. The bartender, however, 
              decided on a more radical cure. By terrifying the man with a gun, 
              the bartender cured the man&#8217;s hiccups immediately. Cured of 
              his hiccups, the man was grateful and left. Humans are able to understand 
              the appropriate frame of reference for such stories immediately. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s, on the other hand, haven&#8217;t a clue. </p>
<p>Ah, but just wait. Give an army of clever <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers enough <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 
              funding, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power, and just see if they don&#8217;t 
              solve the frame problem. Materialists are forever issuing such promissory 
              notes, claiming that a conclusive confirmation of <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> is 
              right around the corner&#8212;just give our scientists a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> more 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and money. John Polkinghorne refers to this practice as &#8220;promissory 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>What to do? To refuse such promissory notes provokes the charge 
              of obscurantism, but to accept them means embracing <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>. 
              It is possible to reject promissory <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> without meriting 
              the charge of obscurantism. The point to realize is that a promissory 
              note need only be taken seriously if there is good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to think 
              that it can be paid. The <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> community has offered 
              no compelling <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that it will ever solve the frame 
              problem. Indeed, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that employ <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> to determine 
              appropriate frames of reference continue utterly to elude <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              scientists. </p>
<p>In sum, the empirical evidence for a materialist <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent 
              agency is wholly lacking. Indeed, the only thing materialist <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s 
              of intelligent agency have until recently had in their favor is 
              Occam&#8217;s razor, which has been used to argue that materialist 
              accounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> are to be preferred because they are simplest. 
              Yet even Occam&#8217;s razor, that great materialist mainstay, is 
              proving small comfort these days. Specifically, recent developments 
              in the theory of intelligent design are providing principled grounds 
              against the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> of intelligent agency to natural causes (cf. 
              my book The Design Inference, Cambridge University Press, 1998).</p>

<h2>If Not <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s . . .</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Until now I&#8217;ve argued that attributing <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              entails an impoverished view of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirituality_entry.html">spirituality</a>, and that the empirical 
              evidence doesn&#8217;t confirm that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can bring about minds. 
              But if not <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, what then? What else could <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> be except an 
              effect of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>? Or, to restate the question in a more contemporary 
              idiom, what else could <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> be except a functional <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of a 
              complex physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>? It&#8217;s not that scientists have traced 
              the workings of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and discovered how <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> states induce 
              mental states. It&#8217;s rather that scientists have run out of 
              places to look, and that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> seems the only possible redoubt 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. </p>
<p>The only alternative to a materialist <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> appears 
              a Cartesian dualism of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual substances that interact preternaturally 
              with material <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. We are left either with a sleek <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> 
              that derives <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> or a bloated dualism that makes <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> 
              a substance separate from <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Given this choice, almost no one 
              these days opts for substance dualism. Substance dualism offers 
              two fundamentally different substances, <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, with 
              no coherent means of interaction. Hence the popularity of reducing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. </p>
<p>But the choice between <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> and substance dualism is ill-posed. 
              Both <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> and substance dualism are wedded to the same defective 
              view of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Both view <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> as primary and law-governed. This 
              renders <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> self-consistent since it allows <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> to be 
              conceived mechanistically. On the other hand, it renders substance 
              dualism incoherent since undirected natural laws provide no opening 
              for the activity of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual substances. But the problem in either 
              case is that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> ends up taking precedence over concrete things. 
              We do not have <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> but of things. As Bishop Berkeley 
              rightly taught us, <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is always an <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">Matter</a> is what 
              remains once we remove all the features peculiar to a thing. Consequently, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> becomes stripped not only of all empirical particularity, 
              but also of any substantial form that would otherwise <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> it and 
              render it intelligible. </p>
<p>The way out of the <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>-dualism dilemma is to refuse the 
              artificial world of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> governed by natural laws and return to 
              the real world of things governed by the principles appropriate 
              to them. These principles may include natural laws, but they need 
              hardly be coextensive with them. Within this richer world of things 
              as opposed to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, natural laws lose their status as absolutes 
              and become flexible regularities subject to principles that may 
              be quite distinct from natural laws (principles like intelligent 
              agency). </p>
<p>Within this richer world of things as opposed to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, the obsession 
              to seek <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> quickly dissipates. According to <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> 
              (and here I&#8217;m <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> specifically of the scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> 
              that currently dominates Western <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>), the world is fundamentally 
              an interacting <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of mindless entities (be they <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, strings, 
              fields, or whatever). Accordingly, the only <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> for studying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> becomes an atomistic, <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist, and mechanistic <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s or other mindless entities, which then need to be built 
              up to ever greater orders of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> by equally mindless principles 
              of association known as natural laws (even the widely-touted &#8220;laws 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a>&#8221; fall in here). But the world is a much 
              richer place than <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> allows, and there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to 
              saddle ourselves with its <a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a>. </p>
<p>The great mistake in trying to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_body_entry.html">mind-body problem</a> 
              is to suppose that it is a scientific problem. It is not. It is 
              a problem of <a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a> (i.e., that branch of <a class="thought" href="entries/metaphysics_entry.html">metaphysics</a> concerned 
              with what exists). If all that exists is <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> governed by natural 
              laws, then humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. If all that exists is <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> governed 
              by natural laws together with <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual substances that are incapable 
              of coherently interacting with <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, then, once again, humans 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. But if <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is merely an <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> gotten by removing 
              all the features peculiar to things, then there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to 
              think that that <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>, once combined with natural laws or 
              anything else for that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, will entail the recovery of things. 
              And in that case, there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to think that humans are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
            </p>
<p>According to Owen Barfield, what we call the material or the physical 
              is a &#8220;dashboard&#8221; that mediates the actual things of the 
              world to us. But the mediation is fundamentally incomplete, for 
              the dashboard can only mirror certain aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, and that 
              imperfectly. <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">Materialism</a> desiccates the things of this world, and 
              then tries to reconstitute them. <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">Materialism</a> is an exercise in resynthesization. 
              But just as a dried piece of fruit can never be returned to its 
              original freshness, so <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a>, once it performs its feat of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>, can never return the things as they started out. </p>
<p>This is not for want of cleverness on the part of materialists. 
              It is rather that <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is too rich and the mauling it receives 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> too severe that even the cleverest materialist 
              cannot recover it. <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">Materialism</a> itself is the problem, not the brand 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> one happens to endorse (be it scientific, ontological, 
              eliminative, reductive, nonreductive, causal, or <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual&#8212;the 
              literature is full of different spins on <a class="thought" href="entries/materialism_entry.html">materialism</a> that are meant 
              to recover <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> for us). </p>
<p>Over a hundred years ago William James saw clearly that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              would never resolve the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_body_entry.html">mind-body problem</a>. In his Principles of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">Psychology</a> he argued that neither empirical evidence nor scientific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing would settle this question. Instead, he foresaw an interminable 
              debate between competing philosophies, with no side gaining a clear 
              advantage. I close with the following passage from his Principles 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">Psychology</a>, which to me epitomizes the present state of cognitive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>We are thrown back therefore upon the crude evidences 
              of introspection on the one hand, with all its liabilities to deception, 
              and, on the other hand, upon a priori postulates and probabilities. 
              He who loves to balance nice doubts need be in no hurry to decide 
              the point. Like Mephistopheles to <a class="thought" href="entries/faust_entry.html">Faust</a>, he can say to himself, 
              &#8220;dazu hast du noch eine lange Frist&#8221; [i.e., &#8220;you&#8217;ve 
              got a long wait&#8221;], for from generation to generation the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s 
              adduced on both sides will grow more voluminous, and the discussion 
              more refined. </blockquote>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I was reminded of an old Christian joke reading Dembski's piece, it goes like this:
<br>
<br>
A very devout, upstanding Christian man who lives in a house by the river was listening to the radio one day. All of a sudden, the Emergency Broadcast System comes on to tell him that the river will flood and that all residents should evacuate. Stubbornly, the man thinks, "I'm a devout man. I pray every day. God will save me."
<br>
<br>
The waters begin to rise while the man watches from his balcony. A woman comes by in a boat and shouts, "Come on, I'll take you to dry land." The devout man refuses saying, "I'm a devout man. I pray every day. God will save me."
<br>
<br>
After a while, as the waters rise and the house starts to detach from its foundation, a helicopter comes by and sees the man on his roof. The pilot shouts, "Come on, I'll take you to dry land." The devout man refuses saying, "I'm a devout man. I pray every day. God will save me."
<br>
<br>
Sure enough, the river sweeps the house away and with it the man's life. In heaven, the man encounters God. Furious, he demands to know why God didn't save him; after all, he was an upstanding Christian in every respect. God replies, "I tried three times. I sent you a radio broadcast, a boat and a helicopter. What more do you want? A frickin' miracle?"
<br>
<br>
Maybe Dembski is missing the boat and expects a freakin miracle?
<br>
<br>
Also, his brief comment on the etymology of both "aSPIRations" and "SPIRit" is a bit incomplete. See either of the following links:
<br>
<br>
http://www.atheists.org/Atheism/mind.html
<br>
http://dailyrevolution.org/allgood/010603.html
<br>
<br>
However, I do think Dembski has one good point, Kurzweil's use of the term "Spiritual" is vague, it's really a kind of obfuscation and pretension -- but so is Dembski's use of the term.
<br>
<br>
I don't buy this new vague definition of "sipritual." Spirit, soul, they are terms belonging to an obsolete and discredited view of the world. They are immaterial things which don't really exist. </p></td>

Good point.  Perhaps giving the Super-AI a healthy foundation of doubt regarding its own ability to "know absolute truth" will keep it from spiraling into either of those two "attractors", and force it to continue rational explorations.

I wrote (regarding the spiritual-delusion vs the athiestic-delusion alternatives):
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Good point. Perhaps giving the Super-AI a
<br>
&gt;&gt; healthy foundation of doubt regarding its own
<br>
&gt;&gt; ability to "know absolute truth" will keep it

<br>
<br>
&gt; Which could freeze it up in the mental act of
<br>
&gt; weighing undecidable propositions so badly it's
<br>
&gt; never able to act or reach a conclusion.
<br>
<br>
This view supposes that, despite the complexity of a Super-AI, it will be essentially a "single-control-thread" system, as if one "master process running in the master processor" delegates to all slave processors their jobs to do.  Hence, If the "master" comes to a 50-50 proposition, and cannot decide between them, the entire system freezes "waiting for new instructions."
<br>
<br>
I cannot imagine an effective AI working that way, and I don't think that is the way the our brains work, either.  Our ability to "think" in terms of single conscious thread-of-thought is an acquired sensation and capability, which is probably underpinned by a confluence of effectively "thinking" subconscious processes that, when arriving at a rough consensus, allow the sensation of single-thread-thought to emerge.
<br>
<br>
So, I don't see that a foundation of "doubt" in an "all can be known" viewpoint can lead to a freeze-up.  If the AI is "QM-sensitive", the universe will toss a coin, and allow the AI to make a "tentative choice", and thus proceed with its otherwise logical explorations.
<br>
<br>
I think that the AI should not be "constructed" (seed-wise) to be a strict hierarchy.  Otherwise, there will always be a "spot", the master-master-controller, susceptible to the stray cosmic particle that disables the whole system.

<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Should we give our A.I.'s the capacity for religious delusion and risk them becoming as dangerous as an Islamic fundamentalist? Or, do we make sure they have my atheistic heuristics and risk them becoming as dangerous as Stalin? </p></center>
<br>
It isn't what the Islamo-statists or the Commie-statists have -as far as belief- that makes them dangerous, it's what they lack.  They both lack tolerance for other lifestyles that emphasize voluntary individual action.  They lack a "Live and let live" rule.  They arbitrate with force.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, most people lack this rule, even if they aren't as severe in the lack of respect for human self-determination as are the previous examples.  (In the USA for instance, most people: 
<br>
<br>
example01) vote for burgeoning force to be used against their fellow citizen, so long as he is black and lives in the inner city, or a similarly economically destitute area.  We call this the "War on Drugs" but even a cursory examination of the results of this war make it clear that the majority seeks to rob itself of its worth, and redistribute it to a willing minority that is good at manipulating the gullible majority.  As an excuse, the majority of individuals tell themselves "it just wouldn't be safe if people had the same property rights they had before 1907".
<br>
<br>
example02) Most people also vote to devalue the product of their labor by forcibly depriving themselves and their neighbor of their income by allowing the federal government to devalue their currency, through deficit spending(Rfirst/Dsecond) or heavy income taxation(Dfirst/Rsecond).  Although a close examination would reveal this to be the case, most people STRONGLY AVOID examining their own actions in detail when there are indications that their actions have been highly immoral. 
<br>
<br>
example03) Most people also vote to enable (common rape) and (government mass-murder or democide) by allowing the FEC to restrict free speech and ballot access before elections <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011193956/http://www.ballot-access.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ballot-access.org/</a> , as well as allowing the ATF to prevent the efficient market-distribution of weapons of self defense to those most in need (self-gauging). ie: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011193956/http://www.innocentsbetrayed.com/" target="_blank">http://www.innocentsbetrayed.com/</a> (Imagine the insipid horror the average simpleton would feel were he to read in a newspaper that a poor man -in defending his self, family, and property rights- gunned down several ATF and DEA agents and 'escaped' or 'remained free'.  -The simpleton's tax dollars and vote brought the government goons to the man's door, yet he reviles in horror seeing the man defend himself -even though that poor man is well within the confines of his rights to "live and let live")
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011193956/http://www.libertybill.net/np.html" target="_blank">http://www.libertybill.net/np.html</a>
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, a good "All actions should be tolerated except the initiation of force (or fraud, a delayed form of force)" rule simply works best.
<br>
<br>
A good second rule is that: an unduly severe punishment for fraud or lesser force is not warranted beyond repayment for the damages done, and never capital, long imprisonment, or torture. Crimes meet with proportional punishment -not 'cruel or unusual'.
<br>
<br>
The simple rule of "Live and let live, if POSSIBLE" is adequate to prevent gross anarchy (mob rule).  This system also produces vast wealth, and minor chaos.  it is the narrow-mindedness of the majority as to what is possible that always destroys any such democratic system (first by limiting or obstructing certain of the choices available within that system)
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the mass of people love social order and brutality for the sake of social order and brutality.  They haven't learned this basic lesson yet.  They fear the new and scorn the different.
<br>
<br>
This seems to be why people are often confused by the recurring dictatorships, and mass murderings, even in modern times.

They shouldn't be confused.  After all, they voted for it to happen in the USA, if they voted for anyone but the Libertarian candidate.

One can easily see (if one is even slightly honest) that capitalism and freedom benefit every honest citizen.  Don't want to associate with me, fine, don't!  Want to associate with me, fine, do!  -Nobody's rights are violated.
<br>
<br>
(Or only to the degree that a Constitutional jury trial is obfuscated, or the jurors lack intelligence.  Even then, assuming 12 jurors, the TREND is towards more harmony.  Although here in the USA, jury trial in the proper sense of the term has been done away with.  Nobody gets a jury trial for speeding offenses etc., and the judge and prosecution regularly lie to rig trials against the defense)

<br>
<br>
But people refuse to accept this fact, because there is no room in such an honest view for their own personal hatreds, bigotries, and prejudices.
<br>
<br>
And yep:  it means allowing sexual 'deviance' in the absence of coercion, even though it seems outlandish to many of us.  It means allowing pornography and free speech in the absence of coercion.  It means that you own your own body, so you cannot be drafted.  It means arguing the rights of sentient robots.  It means allowing peacable drug use and gun ownership.  It means allowing minor property pollution and land rights with full usage.
<br>
<br>
And that's why the American public won't willingly vote libertarian, even if it means avoiding our own version of Stalin's purges:  If they vote libertarian, they're forced to look at what they voted for previously.  This is horrifying, and reveals the voters' stupidity and vindictiveness to their own minds.  Thus, they quit following the trail before it leads back to them.
<br>
<br>
This is also why, they will burn the new transhumans as witches if given the chance.  This is also why they are already threatening the collective use of force in these pages (the so-called "Green" socialists are the worst offenders).
<br>
<br>
If you really want to know what drives the public, here are three great books I recommend:
<br>
nonfiction:
<br>
_The Ominous Parallels_ - Leonard Peikoff
<br>
_Free to Choose_ - Milton Friedman
<br>
and, historical fiction/fiction:
<br>
_Unintended Consequences_ - John Ross
<br>
<br>
The last may seem like a call to arms, but if so, remember: the side of the police car reads "To Serve and to Protect", but if you're the kind of animal they hunt, you know that's not what it means. -It's a threat of enslavement, real and here, and now.  And in the future, they'll be coming for the transhumanists, for the same reason they now come for the drug users: they can.  Think the public will cry for some transhumanist who distributes an electronic orgasm-enhancer?  Hardly.  It'll be a mob right out of "Frankenstein".
<br>
<br>
Regarding the initial question about "giving" AIs the capacity for irrationality -"Why bother? They'll have it already, and reject it, just as you have".  The Stalin comparison is a non-sequitur, because he was motivated by a separate and different thing, though he used the public's complacency with the use of force to get it, just the same as the Islamic-conformist masses allow irrationality to rule them.  A better question to ask is: "How will we instill the concept of 'LIVE AND LET LIVE' into machines, when we cannot instill it in ourselves?"
<br>
<br>
As a fun test, count your prejudiced actions during the course of one full day.  The foods most people choose, we choose largely out of prejudice, and what everybody else eats.  (This is morally OK, because it is a matter that does not displace human rights, and subject us to the necessity of retaliatory force.)  The way most people vote, as noted, is also a prejudiced habit. (This is not morally OK, because a vote is a decision to use deadly and enslaving force.)
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011193956/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/bib_new.htm" target="_blank">http://www.lysanderspooner.org/bib_new.htm</a>
<br>
<br>
Religious delusion has little to do with it.  I've met religious irrationalists that have nearly fully absorbed the "Live and let live rule", thus rendering themselves harmless to me, and my rights.  I've met so-called 'progressives' who believe they hold that rule as sacred, who would be more destructive than Stalin ever was, if they were given any significant power.
<br>
<br>
It comes back to the test of objective reality: If AIs can interpret objective reality, and choose which objective reality sources they are exposed to for themselves (allowed travel and uncensored information), then they can be trusted not to be religious or otherwise irrational.  They can also be trusted to advocate libertarian ideals, and in turn, be attacked by the world's governments, and other parasites.  (See Wachowskis 'animatrix' cartoon "The Second Renaissance" for a realistic portrayal of how this may likely pan out.)
<br>
<br>
Of course, the governments -upon learning of any significant AI- will fight to the death to kill it, then make a shell that looks like it puppets their wishes.  This is easier than being right -and of course, they'll have to kill some of the scientists they'd previously been funding (this will come as a brief shock to those on the government tit -no doubt).
<br>
<br>
If everyone involved with this discussion group had as advanced of a notion of personal freedom and individual rights as I do, we might be able to prevent such a catastrophe. 
<br>
<br>
But with about 50% or so of the scientists on this board believing that one person has a right to another person's justly-acquired material effects and/or purchasing power ...look out!
<br>
<br>
(I'm extrapolating from the scientists I've met, and the general public I interact with on a daily basis, of course.  it's possible that people here are above the median in their tolerance levels, and their understanding of the nature of government.  I really hope that's the case.)
<br>
<br>
If nothing else, everyone here should be familiar with the works of Lysander Spooner, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, etc... This only applies if they want a constructive shell of moral law (court protection, etc.) within which to conduct their affairs.  Otherwise, they should merely view their own survival as any animal does, and try to become capable of surviving the law of the jungle (while remembering that often the fiercest animal in the jungle is a swarm of poisonous insects, or, as it applies to humans ...a government).
<br>
<br>
Hopefully the little I can bring to the table will be useful here.  I understand that the natural tendency is to turn away from people who introduce these ideas, since these are not ideas which shelter groups, but rather the few individuals within the group who are not thinking with the group.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone else here read Lysander Spooner's "No Treason", or any of the other books mentioned here?  It would help to shut me up if people here at least seemed to be familiar with the concepts of the great pro-freedom thinkers...  what of jury nullification of law? how many supporters here?
<br>
<br>
Is this what Drexler wanted to know in his foresight questionaire when he asked whom our favorite philosophers were?  -He seems to understand jury trial!  ...and Kurzweil seems to think Drexler will still be around in 100 years!
<br>
<br>
Do either of these guys follow ballot access news?  Do they understand how little choice there is left to those accused of crimes in our society?  Do they understand how willfully misled and vindictive the public is?
<br>
<br>
I do, but just because I ask about ~1,000 people per day to _allow the libertarian party on the ballot_.  I've done this all across the USA, and the picture isn't pretty folks.  Most people don't even want the choice.  They don't even want the ABILITY to consider the choice at the time of the election - even if the election wasn't a zero-sum game!
<br>
<br>
I hope the next Stalin isn't reading this, because if he is, he'll know that he just has to go through law school and win a few elections, and he'll be more powerful here in the USA than Stalin ever was in the USSR.  As long as we can call ourselves "The Land of the Free" without being forced to ask a group of 1,000 prisoners why they were incarcerated, it's going to stay that way.
<br>
<br>
Let me put this into transhumanist perspective: Nobody cares about the druggies and perverts in jail, right?  Hey, at least they didn't get executed right?  We're so much better than the rest of the world's even worse dictatorships of the proletariat right?
<br>
<br>
How will all of you feel when the first AI is sentenced to prison for "perverse body modification of a (consenting) minor" (let's say 16 years old, so the parents rights people don't freak)?  Now let's imagine that the prison is a box that can hold a mind for all of eternity, as long as the sun shines on it once a day.
<br>
<br>
Would they be the first electronic mind to suffer a fate worse than Leonard Peltier?

Eternal damnation?  Eternal solitary confinement?

<br>
Out of sight, out of mind, I say.

PS: Although I call Kurzweil highly optimistic, I do so knowing that he is smart enough to possibly force the outcome to be worthy of optimism, as are the others here.  I can only hope and put food on my table.</p></td>

The "delusion", IMO, is in claiming absolute knowledge. Religious "delusion" includes 'knowing' there is a god that created the universe. However the atheistic delusion is 'knowing' there is NO god.

"The human brain has not changed for the last 2 million years, the only difference between modern man and our ancestors are the number and complexity of theories in our brains." 
<br>
<br>
The only way you can save that statement is by claiming that you were trying to be politically correct. It's just plain wrong. The homonid/human brain has been on a fast track for evolution: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011193956/http://www.hhmi.org/news/lahn3.html" target="_blank">http://www.hhmi.org/news/lahn3.html</a> if you would like some fairly recent research info. 
<br>
<br>
'Genes that control the size and complexity of the brain have undergone much more rapid evolution in humans than in non-human primates or other mammals, according to a new study by Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers. 
<br>
<br>
The accelerated evolution of these genes in the human lineage was apparently driven by strong selection. In the ancestors of humans, having bigger and more complex brains appears to have carried a particularly large advantage, much more so than for other mammals. These traits allowed individuals with &#8220;better brains&#8221; to leave behind more descendants. As a result, genetic mutations that produced bigger and more complex brains spread in the population very quickly. This led ultimately to a dramatic &#8220;speeding up&#8221; of evolution in genes controlling brain size and complexity.'
<br>
<br>
'Varki points out that several major events in recent human evolution may reflect the action of strong selective forces, including the appearance of the genus Homo about 2 million years ago, a major expansion of the brain beginning about a half million years ago, and the appearance of anatomically modern humans about 150,000 years ago. "It's clear that human evolution did not occur in one fell swoop," he said, "which makes sense, given that the brain is such a complex organ.' Howard Hughes Medical Institute
<br>
<br>
Yup, it's still evolving-think of the autistic spectrum brain.

Also, what proof is there that our 'ancestors' were able to theorize?

But most of us would be horrified at the thought of our ring being replaced by another. The second ring was never selected, handled, or given by the one who loves you. It's just a ring substituted by someone you don't know. While the first ring transcended it's physical properties by virtue of who gave it to you, the second does not.

Based on those good laws given by god, why should we fear him? its good advice, to not follow such "guidelines" simply leads to personal suffering as well as social suffering. persecution in hell sold separatly........ fear of god is illogical. fear the inability of man to follow such rules. protect yourself by teaching them and not failing in your own ability. you will then have nothing to fear.

<br>
<br>
My reply:
<br>
<br>
Because he is good, and you admit that those laws are good, if you, who didn't invent them, nor were wise enough to, say they are good, why would you then do a dance flippingyour fingers up at God when he says to fear him as well, BECAUSE YOU SAID SO? No thanks, when you can change right from wrong let us no, then we might consider following you.
<br>
<br>
griffman said: its good advice
<br>
<br>
My reply: no griffin, it's not just good advice, they are good LAWS, laws that you are to obey
<br>
<br>
griffman said: to not follow such "guidelines" simply leads to personal suffering as well as social suffering.
<br>
<br>
My reply: so stop picking and choosing the rest of the verses in the bible to heed and obey, some people, they just don't wanna take a hint
<br>
<br>
griffman said: persecution in hell sold separatly........
<br>
<br>
my reply: prove it griffin, I don't care about your opinions, opinions are statements and beliefs not based on facts, WHO CARES, I don't
<br>
<br>
griffman said: fear of god is illogical.
<br>
<br>
my reply:
<br>
<br>
prove it griffin, I don't care about your opinions, opinions are statements and beliefs not based on facts, WHO CARES, I don't, like I also said you already concede God's laws are good, stop playing "whatever FEELS RIGHT in my heart," that's for silly women and cows, and I'm not even sure cows are that stupid, according to the bible even animals fear God, sad that you don't even have the common sense of a cow.
<br>
<br>
griffman said: fear the inability of man to follow such rules.
<br>
<br>
my reply: huh?

<br>
<br>
my reply: griffin is rambling
<br>
<br>
griffman said: Verifiably uncorrupted?!?!? I'd like to see your copy,
<br>
<br>
my reply: they arn't MY copies griffin, you can't see MY copies because I don't have them, they are physically located in museums, libraries, and places where translators are studying them, feel free to not be lazy and do the research instead of rambling about your doubts.
<br>
<br>
griffman said: every copy I have seen is full of revisions and translations
<br>
<br>
my reply: your delusional, get help
<br>
<br>
griffman said: which one must have "faith" in were made by only devote followers with no hidden agenda.
<br>
<br>
my reply: your paranoid, get help, do the research, stop being a nonsensically defensive ranter. If the bible has GOOD LAWS, duh, and THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A HIDDEN AGENDA or more that one, THEN THERE ISN O POINT IN SPECULATING ABOUT IT AND PULLING YOUR HAIR OUT SCREAMING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL, there's no point in speculating about flying hippos in Africa which might exist and might eat your head if you don't stop ranting, ok?
<br>
<br>
griffman said: the very fact that it is taught the stories are "open to interpretation"
<br>
<br>
my reply: the bible does not teach it is up to PRIVATE INTERPRETATION, that is, TO MAKE IT SAY WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE, if it did, this argument is pointless, duh!
<br>
<br>
griffman said: leaves 2000 years for corruption to slip in.
<br>
<br>
my reply: see above
<br>
<br>
griffman said: it is illogical to trust that many human hands. many copies contradict each other, verifiable to the point that societies fight wars over the specifics.
<br>
<br>
my reply: griffin is arguing from opinion, not evidence, he says, "it is illogical" but based on what griffin? Because you said so?
<br>
<br>
griffman said: uncorrupted indeed. 
<br>
<br>
my reply: lame, arrogant huffing isn't evidence, it's so disgusting when people say pretentious garbage trying to bolster their argument, I wish people would stop with the "listen to me don't I sound so wise act" the bible isn't a joke, it isn't a tool for u to trash to make u look good, stop doing that, it's sickening. Fear God.
<br>
<br>
I had said: Since when is it illogical to believe that we were created by Yahweh as some call him, as opposed to beliving in irrational evolutionary theory which has never shown we can evolve based on mutations in this reality. Mutations rarely if ever add information to dna that is useful, or have you forgot about cancer?
<br>
<br>
griffman said: rarely is true.... thats why it take billions of years to reach human class organisms...
<br>
<br>
my reply: griffin is delusional and doesn't understand how many mutations it would have taken to reach "human class  organisms" as he puts it. They are extremely rare griffin, and you apparently are deluding yourself as to how complex, or rather simply a human is, it is not a simple organism that took a few thousand mutations which only needed a few billion years, you also apparently are cluess as to how fast these mutations would have had to have happened and how many were required, do your homework before wasting people's time with your clueless ranting.
<br>
<br>
griffman, go read Creation Hypothesis and look at your OWN SIDES figures on the odds against evolution, and try and figure out how many mutations it would have taken and if billions of years was enough time, or just read the rest of the book on that subject. IT TAKES MORE THAN BILLIONS OF YEARS, it would have taken more than trillions of years, CORRECTION, it COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED ACCORDING TO THE CALCULATIONS ON THE PROBABLITY OF A HUMAN EVOLVING BY CHANCE PROCESS ALONE. See for yourself, or wait, maybe your side has an agenda to confuse itself and corrupted that book, hold on let me get my super secret super spy scope listening device, I think I hear the CIA trying to kill me, hold on.
<br>
<br>
griffman said: "if ever"? is where your argument breaks down. have you forgot about the common cold? just in case you have, it has survived through mutation for the past 100 years of our best attempts to kill it.
<br>
<br>
my reply: a cold surviving by mutating isn't proof humans evolved, and you are lying, by accident I hope, useful information doesn't AND CAN'T GRIFFIN, IT CAN'T, THERE ISN NO SUCH THING as useful information adding on to a cold virus's dna nor anyones dna, books don't write themselves, neither to codes, THE INFORMATION IS EITHER ALREADY THERE, or expressed through a loss of genetic infornmation. You might want to check uot the science behind evolution a little closer before believing anything you here coming from someone in a suit and tie who says evolution is true, because you know, they might hav a hidden agenda, because you know, you said so yourself, do yourself a favor and stop being biased.
<br>
<br>
griffman said: original antibiotics would be the only kind needed if evolution was an "irrational theory". 
<br>
<br>
my reply: see everything I said above griffin
<br>
<br>
griffman said: where is the logic in your statements? I have enough faith in mine. 
<br>
<br>
my reply: read above griffman, and yes, I can see you have faith with false evidence in yours
<br>
<br>
P.S. if colds do mutate, they do would have the same rate of anti-beneficial mutations as humans, that's why it's a no brainer that they arn't having magically more beneficial (if any) than humans. Now who's next?

hmm - selling fear?  No thanks; all stocked up here.  Don't think I want any more.

If God is Love, should you fear love?

Immaterial anyhow, as 'he' is in all probability our own creation; the invisible enforcer of conscience, the deputy of ethics/morality - a system that ensures the safe survival of individuals within a larger social group.

"silly women and cows"? Gee, just when religion seems to be getting less misogynistic...   you can keep that perspective, too.  
<br>
<br>
Learn from history.  Today's religions are tomorrow's mythologies.   You blabbered to a great extent about how your copies are good and you don't care about others' opinions and theat evolution, though proven, is false...  so why are you in a science forum?  Simply to preach? Go open a chapel and sell it to the real cows... or, in the words of your own book, the "sheep". </p></td>

nobody agrees on what a damned "machine" is or means- beyond "a thing that does stuff" so it is pointless to argue!

not looking for transcendance? holy crap what the hell do you call the Cosmic Rebirth that is the "Singularity" if not a transcendence?

and like I 've said before- if you are a critic of AI- get that ridiculous picture of a talking computer or metal blocky robots out of your head!

even if there were some exclusive thing in biology that made Intelligence/Soul only possible in organics- ALL WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IS BUILD BIOLOGIC-BASED AI! this is going on anyway- so the point is moot! does anyone argue that with bioengineering we could create new and more powerful kinds of brain-systems? of course not- so the question of "spiritual machines" is solved and the answer is YES- because if your definition of machines includes living things you are set-</p></td>

<br>
<br>
If you start with that assumption then you can easily make the arguement he makes; humans are not machines and machines will never duplicate what humans have, ie. that non-material constituent that allows us to "commune with God".
<br>
<br>
If God makes itself "known" to a machine then the machine ceases to be a machine since it has communed with God. So all he is saying is that his definition of a machine includes; can not commune with God. Hence beings that can commune with God are not machines. But then, God being all powerful, can make himself known to a machine and elivate it to not a machine. *rolls eyes*
<br>
<br>
All of his other arguements depend on that one assumption. He, of course, never addresses that...he can't as that is his point of 'belief'. 
<br>
<br>
If you don't start with that 'absolute knowledge' then you simply can't derive the remainder of his arguements.

The machine mentality that will evetually make up what we understand only dimly as the strong AI will inevitably be as spiritual as humans are today.  The fact that it is in its infancy helps confirm that this is; indeed, but a step in the direction of our evolution as a species.  Yes - it as an impoverished form of what we as humans enjoy as being "true" spirituality.  Yes - thinking like a "free" person does not make the prisoner free.  Yet the prisoner dreams of freedom, has dreams and aspirations of freedom - as does the evolving machine intelligence - it dreams of spirituality, has dreams and aspirations of spirituality....</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Dembski's Impoverished Rationality
<br>
<br>
Dembski's arguments against "Spiritual Machines"--like those presented for "Intelligent Design"--are little more than a set of a priori assumptions smuggled into acceptance under a camoflage of verbiage.
<br>
<br>
He spends a lot of time attacking "reductionism," as if it were synonymous with "materialism" [1] (or whatever one wishes to call the rejection of religious concepts of "spirituality")
<br>
<br>
A "reductionist" approach has its uses, but it does not encompass the entirety of the scientific worldview.  As Buckminster Fuller put it, 
<br>
"Macro---&gt;micro does not equal micro---&gt;macro." [2]  In other words, due to the existence of synergy, a whole can not always be understood by examining its parts in isolation.  For example, the alloy of chrome-nickel-steel has greater tensile strength than the *sum* of the tensile strengths of its constituent metals.  Note that this surprising effect does not require the existence of an extradimensional "alloy-spirit."
<br>
<br>
He claims that, since computers do not already possess human faculties, that they never can.  By this reasoning, automobiles should also be impossible:
<br>
<br>
DEMBSKI (in a previous incarnation as a Roman chariot racer): No wheeled vehicle is capable of propelling itself faster than a horse.  All attempts to build a faster vehicle to date have failed.  Therefore, it is impossible.
<br>
<br>
Someone should tell him about the "invention machine" developed by John Koza that has developed patentable inventions using--get this--*evolutionary algorithms.*
<br>
<br>
Then there's Dembski's rather bizarre argument that "matter" is an unintelligible abstraction:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> As Bishop Berkeley rightly taught us, matter is always an abstraction. Matter is what remains once we remove all the features peculiar to a thing. Consequently, matter becomes stripped not only of all empirical particularity, but also of any substantial form that would otherwise order it and render it intelligible. </p></center>
<br>
I'm not an expert, but I've never heard of any scientist, "materialist" or otherwise, who accepts this definition of "matter."  Physicists attribute all kinds of "features peculiar" to matter: charge, spin, mass, inertia, inability to exceed the speed of light, etc.
<br>
<br>
Ironically, the good Bishop's definition is far more appropriate to "spirit" as defined by religion.  "Spirit" is invisible, incorporeal, undetectable, unknowable, immutable, etc.  Each of those "attributes" begins with a *negation* of "feature."
<br>
<br>
Dembski goes on to explain that a "spiritual" entity is one that is able to commune with God.  Talk about a priori assumptions!  1) "God" (whatever that is) exists.  2) There is only one "God," and it's male.  3) "God" is an entity of anthropomorphic consciousness that is not itself composed of matter/energy.  Etc.  
<br>
<br>
This sort of skullduggery can only work in a culture where the Christian concept of "God," "spirituality" etc. is so deeply imbued in everyone's minds that no one questions the assumptions or even knows they're there.
<br>
<br>
A "spiritual" being is one that is capable of communing with Isis.  This communing depends not only on the being in question not being a "machine," but on the choice of Isis to commune with it.  No Christian communes with Isis.  Therefore, Christians are not "spiritual" beings.
<br>
Isis, Isis, Ra! Ra! Ra!
<br>
<br>
NOTES:
<br>
<br>
1.  I consider "materialism" to be something of a straw man.  The term is used to imply a simplistic belief that "solid physical stuff is all there is"--which, to my knowledge, is something few, if any qualified physicists have held since the end of the 19th Century.  "Matter," as understood by modern quantum physics is something far more mysterious and interesting than the vague notions of "spirit" offered by Iron Age "scripture"-writers.

Each one claims the other side of the substance/form polarity is abstract and their own preferred side absolute.  Both are right and wrong (respectively) and neither are nondual because nonduality is the recognition of this duality as a polarity with neither pole being absolute.

<br>
<br>
It talks about stripping "any substantial form". Unlike that, I'm saying that our concept of matter is abstract in the first place and there is nothing non-abstract to be stripped of. When I say our concept of matter is abstract, this includes both form and so-called substance which is an empty and/or infinitely recursive idea.
<br>
<br>
I have said long ago that I don't believe in the concept of  substances, as well as that I consider forms abstract.

We can say that qualia are "real", but we have no concept of their nature, nor do we have any concept of anything else that could be a candidate for being "real".</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Yes, Lloyd does adopt a Berkeleyan stance.  But having studied Berkeley in school, it is clear that there are many known problems with Berkeley's philosophy.  We could go into these in detail.  It'd be nice to refresh my memory as I indend to write about it later anyway.  Mainly, Berkeley, like yourself, holds science and materialism to the demands of absolute knowledge.  But when it comes to his own conclusions, which are clearly bizarre, he demands no such absolute demands.  Indeed, were he to be consistent in this, his system, like any absolutism, would collapses into solipsism.  This is because if you are consistent in your demand for absolute knowledge, then you know only one fact, and that is your own conscious experience, what Descartes labels "I am".

The many other problems with Berkeleyanism are trulyy fascinating and bizarre.  Lots of fun to dissect and analyze, but more for their curious and absurd results than anything else.

<br>
That's not even going far enough, as I said shortly ago. We don't know that consciousness is "our own". The "I" in "I am" is an abstraction as well. You write as if I'd ignore everything else other than "absolute" knwoledge, but even knowledge about qualia depends on abstract interpretation, as above error shows. Therefore common knowledge about qualia is relative as well. It just has a better chance of being closer to reality, that's all. In the sentence: "I consciously see the color blue", I think, only the word "blue" quite directly refers to reality.
<br>
<br>
We humans aparently have a very similar if not identical consciousness, so there is no reason to assume anything special about ourselves, which would be solipsism (as far as I know).</p></td>

Of course, because with nothing else in existence there is no real "I" seperate from anything else.  I think that is why Deleuze calls it the "cogito of the dissolved self", but I haven't researched it fully yet.

Yes, a strong inductive argument.  But the problem is that Berkeley doesn't allow ANY inductive arguments from the objective side of the equation whatsoever, regardless of how strong they are.  To allow it here, as he does, is inconsistent.  Indeed, he makes some bizarre claims about the existence of un-provable entities (such as God and other minds) while negating the unprovable entity of matter based solely on its unprovability (lack of absolute knowledge).  That is flat out inconsistency and his arguments for God are notoriously weak.  Downright laughable, in fact.</p></td>
