<div class="TeaserText">On April 24, 2001, Raymond Kurzweil was awarded the prestigious Lemelson-MIT prize, the world's largest single award for invention and innovation.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published May 25, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>
<b>New York, NY, April 24, 2001</b>--The Lemelson-MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> announced today that its annual $500,000 prize--the world's largest single award for <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> and innovation--is being presented to <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>, a pioneer of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> technologies who has made a career of helping others, while showing a flair for integrating <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and the arts. Over the past 35 years, Kurzweil has produced a lengthy list of achievements and innovations that have enriched society, including: advancing <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) technologies; founding, developing and selling four successful companies; and writing two best-selling books that support his predictions for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Kurzweil is being recognized by the Lemelson-MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> for the breadth and scope of his inventive work, and for his commitment to enhancing the quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> for people with disabilities through <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Kurzweil is credited with many <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> "firsts" that span such diverse fields as <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, speech <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and the visual arts. These include the first omni-font <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>; the first print-to-speech <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a> for the blind; the first text-to-speech <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>; the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> capable of reproducing the sounds of orchestral <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s; and the first commercially-marketed large vocabulary speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Kurzweil's latest innovation represents an advance in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, a virtual performing and recording artist, "<a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>."</p>
<p>Kurzweil's landmark <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> is the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a>, introduced in 1976, which converts print to speech. To date, the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> has made it possible for many thousands of blind people to read the text of ordinary books, magazines and other printed documents. The first owner of a Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> was legendary musician <a class="thought" href="entries/wonder_entry.html">Stevie Wonder</a>, who contacted Kurzweil after hearing about the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>.</p>
<blockquote>"The Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> was a breakthrough that changed my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>," says Wonder, who helped nominate Kurzweil for the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize. "With the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a>, I could read anything I wanted with complete privacy: <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> lyrics, letters from my children, the latest best sellers and magazines, memos from my business associates. It gave blind people the one thing that everyone treasures, which is independence."</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, it was Kurzweil's friendship with Wonder which led to another major innovation: the Kurzweil 250 <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">Synthesizer</a> (K250). On a tour through Wonder's studio in 1982, Kurzweil learned of Wonder's frustrations with the current technical limitations that prevented the bridging of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> composition with the sounds of acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. Introduced commercially in 1984, the K250 was the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> to emulate successfully the complex sound response of a grand piano and virtually all other orchestral <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s.</p>
<p>Currently, Kurzweil is focusing on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051128044440/http://www.kurzweilai.net/" target="_new">KurzweilAI.net</a> (Kurzweil Accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a>), a Web-based subsidiary of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_technologies_entry.html">Kurzweil Technologies</a>, Inc. (KTI) that showcases ideas of leading technologists and "big thinkers." The main concentration of KurzweilAI.net is on the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, both <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and artificial. "<a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>," Kurzweil's alter ego and a lifelike, photo-realistic, interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a> (virtual personality) with conversational abilities, simultaneously guides users through KurzweilAI.net and showcases the latest advancements in intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>

<p>Kurzweil will be formally presented with the Lemelson-MIT Prize on Wednesday, April 25, at a special ceremony at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> in Washington, D.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. This year, the ceremony will be held in conjunction with "Nobel Week," a series of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s honoring the centennial of the Nobel Prizes, hosted by the Lemelson Center for the Study of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">Invention</a> and Innovation at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a>.</p>
<p>Kurzweil gratefully acknowledges the role that his creative parents as well as his teachers and peers have played in his success as an inventor over the years. "Encouragement is necessary for young inventors to succeed. It is important for kids to realize that they have the authority to explore their own ideas and that it is okay to fail," he says.</p><h1>ABOUT THE LEMELSON-MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">PROGRAM</a></h1><p>Based at the Massachusetts Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Lemelson-MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> was established in 1994 by the late independent inventor Jerome H.
