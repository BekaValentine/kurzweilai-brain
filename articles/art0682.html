<p><b>Anthrax. Smallpox. Ebola.</b> For thriller writers and policy 
              crusaders, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a> was a standard what-if scenario long 
              before anyone mailed anthrax to <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> offices in 
              2001. Pentagon war games like Dark Winter, held just before 9/11, 
              and this year's Atlantic Storm suggested that terrorists could unleash 
              germs with the killing power of a nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists, though, have always been skeptical. Only massive, state-sponsored 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s&#8212;not terrorist cells or lone kooks&#8212;pose a plausible 
              threat, they say. As the head of the Federation of American Scientists 
              working group on bioweapons put it in a 2002 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 
              op-ed: "A significant bioterror attack today would require the support 
              of a national program to succeed."</p>
<p>Or not. A few months ago, Roger Brent, a geneticist who runs a 
              California biotech firm, sent me an unpublished paper in which he 
              wrote that genetically <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered bioweapons developed by small 
              teams are a bigger threat than suitcase nukes.</p>
<p>Brent is one of a growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers who believe that 
              a bioterrorist wouldn't need a team of virologists and state funding. 
              He says advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-hacking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> have reached the point 
              where an evil lab assistant with the right resources could do the 
              job.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3> Gene <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s could make artificial smallpox&#8212;or worse&#8212;from 
                standard lab supplies.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to call him on it. I hadn't <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> foot in a lab since high 
              school. Could I learn to build a bioweapon? What would I need? What 
              would it cost? Could I set up shop without raising suspicions? And, 
              most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant, would it work?</p>
<p align="center"> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.molsci.org/Dispatch?action-PersonWidget:20-detail=1" target="_blank"><img border="1" height="253" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/Boutin_rogerbrentbw.jpg" width="356"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p> <i>"An advanced grad student could do it." &#8212;Roger Brent, 
                head of the Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>s Institute in Berkeley, California. 
                </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To find out, I meet with Brent at the Molecular Sciences Institute, 
              his company in Berkeley. The 49-year-old researcher has a few million 
              dollars a year in government funding and a staff of 25. He's the 
              co-author of the must-read lab manual <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/mrwhome/104554809/HOME?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0" target="_blank"><i>Current 
              Protocols in Molecular Biology</i></a>, and hardly seems like someone 
              in the grip of apocalyptic fervor. As he shows me around the lab&#8212;a 
              few quiet rooms of workbenches, pipette stands, pinky-sized test 
              tubes and the odd PowerBook&#8212;we plan our attack.</p>
<p>Experts used to think that distributing a killer germ would require 
              a few vats and a crop duster. Brent and I have a different idea. 
              We'll infect a suicidal patient zero and hand him a round-the-world 
              plane ticket. But we need a dangerous virus&#8212;smallpox, maybe. 
              We won't be able to steal a sample; we'll have to make our own.</p>
<p>Too dangerous, Brent says. He gives me a proxy mission: Modify 
              something mundane into something strange. In this case, rejigger 
              standard brewer's yeast to manufacture a glowing cyan-colored <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> 
              usually found in jellyfish.</p>
<p>Great. I wanted to make something as lethal as an A-bomb, and instead 
              I'm brewing ultraviolet beer.</p>
<p>Brent smiles and shrugs at my disappointment. "All <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is one," 
              he says, and he's not just being <a class="thought" href="entries/zen_entry.html">Zen</a>. All over the world, laboratories 
              like Brent's splice genes&#8212;the techniques are as common as the 
              Pyrex beaker, and getting easier every day. Getting yeast to sport 
              blue genes takes the same skills and gear as adding the genes for 
              something toxic. DNA is just the stuff that tells cells what proteins 
              to make&#8212;the only real difference between being able to insert 
              a single gene and inserting all the genes that make a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>.</p>
<p>I start my to-do list: I have to acquire the right equipment. I 
              have to track down the genetic sequence I want, then learn how to 
              make the gene. Then I have to get it into the yeast. Brent offers 
              me lab <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and staff advice, but insists that I do the work myself. 
              And not everyone has the knack, he says. "Some people are natural-born 
              labsters, some aren't." I know what he means. I used to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              engineer, and in that field, procedures are well documented and 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/source_code_entry.html">source code</a> is readily available, but some people just aren't 
              hackers.</p>
<p>It's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to find out what kind of genetic engineer I am.</p>
<p><b>Making DNA turns out</b> to be easy if you have the right <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. 
              The critical piece of gear is a DNA <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>. Brent already has 
              one, a yellowing plastic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> the size of an office <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>, 
              called an ABI 394. "So, what kind of authorization do I need to 
              buy this equipment?" I ask.</p>
<p>"I suggest you start by typing 'used DNA synthesizer' into <a class="thought" href="entries/google_entry.html">Google</a>," 
              Brent says.</p>
<p>I hit eBay first, where ABI 394s go for about $5,000. Anything 
              I can't score at an auction is available for a small markup at sites 
              like usedlabequip.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>. Two days later I have a total: $29,700&#8212;taxes 
              and shipping not included. Nucleosides (the A, <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, T, G genetic building 
              blocks) and other chemicals for the synthesizer cost more than the 
              hardware&#8212;in the end, a single base pair of DNA runs about a 
              buck to make. Enough raw material to build, say, the smallpox <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              would take just over $200,000.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="1" height="300" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/Boutin_abi_394.jpg" width="400"><br>
<i>The ABI 394 synthesizer. <br>
              Think of it as an inkjet printer for DNA.</i></p>
<p>The real cost of villainy is in overhead. Even with the ready availability 
              of equipment, you still need space, staff, and time. Brent guesses 
              he would need a couple million dollars to whip up a batch of smallpox 
              from scratch. No need for state sponsors or stolen top-secret germ 
              samples. "An advanced grad student could do it," Brent says. Especially 
              with the help of some high schoolers who actually went to lab classes.</p>
<p>But how would I find the gene sequence? Simple. I went to the Web 
              site of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National 
              Center for Biotechnology Information</a> (no password required) 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed the DNA sequence for a 770-base pair gene called 
              the Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein. That's what Brent wanted 
              me to program into my yeast. It took me about 15 minutes to find. 
              Far easier to track down was the 200,000-base pair <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genome&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=10477" target="_blank">sequence 
              for smallpox</a>. Only two known samples of smallpox exist; the 
              blueprints are free online.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 align="center"> It's glowing. Is that good?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>I load my nucleosides into the ABI 394, and it's as easy as replacing 
              a toner cartridge. I transmit a test sequence from my Mac and go 
              to lunch. When I come back, I have a custom strand of genetic material 
              waiting for me. This is the anyone-on-<a class="thought" href="entries/slashdot_entry.html">Slashdot</a>-can-do-it part of 
              the job.</p>
<p>These days, many labs don't even bother synthesizing their own 
              genes. They <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> chains online. That's right: mail-order 
              genes. Just to test this out, I buy a sequence from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.mwg-biotech.com/html/all/index.php" target="_blank">MWG 
              Biotech</a> in High Point, North Carolina, and have it shipped to 
              my house. Three days later, I'm sitting on the train to Berkeley 
              holding a FedEx box. MWG didn't do anything wrong, but not long 
              ago <i>New Scientist</i> magazine approached <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg18825252.900.html" target="_blank">sixteen 
              other custom DNA shops</a> to find out if they scan incoming orders. 
              Could a terrorist order a killer virus piece by piece? Only five 
              of the sixteen said they screen every sequence.</p>
<p>Still, mail-order is cheating. If you were a smart terrorist, you'd 
              make the thing yourself to avoid suspicion. You can't order smallpox, 
              but anyone's allowed to buy raw genetic material and lab equipment&#8212;the 
              government only monitors certain radioactive, toxic, or otherwise 
              scary substances.</p>
<p><b>Getting living cells to absorb</b> synthetic genes is where 
              biotech stops looking like IT and turns into French cooking. The 
              process, called transformation, happens in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> only rarely; it's 
              part of the way microorganisms evolve. In the lab, you can improve 
              the odds it'll work by softening up the host cells with chemicals 
              and removing sections of their DNA with tailor-made enzymes. Douse 
              the hosts with synthetic DNA and some fraction of them slurp it 
              up. And some fraction of those start making the protein that the 
              gene codes for. It doesn't <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> if it's jellyfish fluorescence 
              or smallpox (though obviously smallpox is more complicated).</p>
<p>It sounds like submicroscopic surgery, but all you do is squirt 
              chemicals into a culture dish and let it all soak overnight. In 
              the morning you come back to see if it worked or, more likely, didn't. 
              My first batch flops. My second, too. One of the MSI researchers 
              offers to break Brent's rules and do it for me while I watch. It 
              doesn't work for him, either.</p>
<p>Eventually, we fumble our way to a plastic dish full of translucent 
              goop. If I'd been working on smallpox&#8212;and really committed 
              to my cause&#8212;this would have been the part where I'd inject 
              a lab <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> with the stuff to see if it got sick. Then I'd give 
              myself a dose and head off on a days-long, multi-airport, transnational 
              suicide run. But it was just yeast. Set on top of a black <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, 
              it glowed an eerie bright blue, like a Jimi Hendrix poster. My creation... 
              <i>lived</i>.</p>

<p>Would the nations of the world kneel before my awesome power? I 
              asked an expert. Three years ago, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/microbiology/Wimmer.html" target="_blank">Eckard 
              Wimmer</a> headed a team of researchers at SUNY Stony Brook that 
              made live polio virus from scratch, part of a Defense Department 
              project to prove the threat of synthetic bioweapons. So how much 
              of a leap is that from cyan-tinged yeast?</p>
<p>"A simple laboratory technician would have trouble," he says. With 
              smallpox, "the virus is very large and brings with it enzymes that 
              it needs to proliferate. If you just made the genome and put it 
              into a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, nothing would happen."</p>
<p>In the wild, viruses hijack host cells and turn them into virus 
              replication factories. Wimmer was sure any one of the 2,847 members 
              of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.mcw.edu/asv/" target="_blank">American 
              Society for Virology</a> could figure out how to do the same.</p>
<p>Soon, though, I might not even need that expertise. DNA <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> 
              is following a kind of accelerated Moore's law&#8212;the faster and 
              easier it gets, the faster and easier it gets. Last year, a group 
              of researchers synthesized DNA strands of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v432/n7020/abs/nature03151_fs.html" target="_blank">more 
              than 300,000 base pairs</a>&#8212;longer than the smallpox genome&#8212;using 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that eliminates most of the shake-and-bake lab steps I'd

              (and Brent's former lab partner at MSI) who worked them out in 2003.

              in an eight-hour day."</p>
<p>Today, when he's not tinkering with cellular-scale measurement 
              gadgets at the University of Washington, Carlson designs custom 
              proteins on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in his Seattle home. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/view.html?pg=2" target="_blank">According 
              to his calculations</a>, if the current pace of biotech proceeds 
              for another decade, cooking up a lethal <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a> will be as easy and 
              cheap as building a Web site. "You don't need a national program," 
              Carlson says. "The technology's changing fast, and there's nothing 
              we can do about it."</p>
<p>Even if he's wrong about the timeframe, if someone solves the problem 
              of synthesizing <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> (the single-stranded adjunct to DNA), it would 
              open the door to modifying influenza or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus" target="_blank">retroviruses</a> 
              like HIV&#8212;and in 1918 the flu managed to kill 20 million people 
              without any help from bioterrorists.</p>

<p> <b>"If we do what we need to for biodefense ... We could, as

</blockquote>
<p>Bolstered by what scientists like Carlson and Brent are saying, 
              bioweapon policy wonks are calling for an all-out biodefense program. 
              Worried about <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> and viruses of mass destruction, the federal 
              government pushes nearly $6 billion a year toward research. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017235205/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/pages/center/staff/tara.html" target="_blank">Tara 
              O'Toole</a>, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for 
              Biosecurity, says after-the-fact vaccines won't stop a plague; they 
              take months to develop and deploy. She believes the only option 
              is a general-purpose virus detector and destroyer, which has yet 
              to be invented. The cost would be enormous, but don't think of it 
              as just an antiterror tool. "If we do what we need to for biodefense, 
              we're going to do an enormous amount of good for routine health 
              care and global <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>," says O'Toole. "We could, as a planet, 
              eliminate large lethal epidemics of infectious disease in our lifetime."</p>
<p>Brent agrees. He's been tinkering on a general virus detector as 
              a side project. "Of course I'd be thrilled to see a huge expenditure 
              on defense," he says. "But the truth is, it'll probably take an 
              attack to get us there."</p>
<p><b>We might not have long</b> to wait. Every hands-on gene hacker 
              I polled during my project estimated they could synthesize smallpox 
              in a month or two. I remember that game from my engineering days, 
              so I mentally scale their estimates using the old software manager's 
              formula: Double the length, then move up to the next increment of 
              time. That gives us two to four years&#8212;assuming no one has already 
              started working.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I remember reading a piece of a book, 10-15 years ago, that described, in 2 paragraphs, how ANYONE with some milk &amp; , protective wear, and hot outdoor space, could 'create' strains of highly lethal super-botulism. 
<br>
<br>
Just like 1 dedicated person can rob a bank, even though there are numerous precautions/safeguards to keep just that from happening, so are there NUMEROUS methods for a potential terrorist to attack a facility or populace.
<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that instead of looking for after-the-matterm but pre-prevention-before-the-next-one-comes solutions are NOT the way to go.
<br>
<br>
We need to start addressing the issues of WHY the MAJORITY of these 'terrorists' feel that these are viable options/solutions, and address the root cause(s) that drive them to these acts.
<br>
<br>
Lack of food? Potable water? Education opportunities? Opportunities? Repression? Once we start from the greatest common denominators, and removing these issues, I think you will find MOST of the causes of unrest dropping off - and the number of people looking towards violent/destructive 'solutions,' as well.
<br>
<br>
Yes, there will always be 'nutters' and people with heavy grudges, wether real or imagined, and so some defensive measure will be neccessary. but, this is NOT akin to the Cold War buildups between East and West; as well proven in this article, ANYONE with the means can create and release this new generation of .38 special, with far reaching and catastrophic results.</p></td>

Shure, it's probably wise to spend some billions on a pre-emptive vaccine, but I think it's more urgent (and cheaper) to monitor - and plan necessary actions - water, air and food.</p></td>

In my opinion the decline of western civilization will not come from a bomb or from bioweapons or some other inchoate threat, but from simple complacency. The postings on this site not only lead me to believe that American civilization is uneducated and ultimately superficial, but to conclude that our lack of education will be our downfall. We are so frightened that a bomb may interrupt our trip to the mall to run up our credit cards that we are failing to look within for the solutions to our problems. WE MUST TEND TO THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN: WE MUST REJECT ABJECT COMMERCIALISM AND BAND TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD. I believe that this is not only our destiny as a nation, but our responsibility as leaders of the free world. And yes, to be a leader, you must be free, but our free choices must be moral and ethical ones. We must look to history, science and the way of thought as the rainbow bridge to our consilient future.</p></td>
