<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p><i><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, one of the foremost pioneers in the field of artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, has been called &#8220;the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8221; 
              by Forbes magazine. As early as 1974, he led the development of 
              the first &#8220;omni-font&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a> (OCR) 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which made it possible for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to recognize printed 
              and typed documents. In 1976, he adapted this technology for use 
              in the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a>, which reads documents aloud to 
              the blind and visually impaired. His OCR technology also provided 
              the capability for Lexus and Nexus to build their online legal and 
              news <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> services. He also developed the first <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly 
              marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.</i></p>
<p><i>In 1999, Kurzweil received the <a class="thought" href="entries/national_medal_technology_entry.html">National Medal of Technology</a>, 
              the nation&#8217;s highest honor in technology, from President Clinton 
              in a White House ceremony. He has received hundreds of other national 
              and international awards and is the author of The Age of Intelligent 
              Machines (1990) and The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, When Computers 
              Exceed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Intelligence (1999).</i></p>
<p><i>This speech recognition pioneer shared his <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s on the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              of computers in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> with the editors and readers of this SCAR 
              Primer.</i></p>
<p>The last <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I brought my car in for a check-up, the dealer had 
              a comprehensive <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of all of its repairs and tests up on his 
              screen as I pulled in. The last time I brought my body in for a 
              check-up, my doctor had a thick folder of dog-eared paper records 
              on his desk. If we wanted to plot one of my health variables&amp;#8212cholesterol, 
              say&#8212;this would require a time-consuming project of thumbing 
              through many disparate records in varied formats, assuming the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> 
              could be found at all.</p>
<p>Medicine is perhaps the most <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-intensive profession one 
              can pursue, so it may seem surprising that we are not further along 
              in the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, which is the most powerful technology 
              we have for containing and controlling knowledge. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for 
              this state of affairs are many: medical knowledge is extremely complex 
              and, therefore, difficult to represent in rigid tabular <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s, 
              and there are no clear authorities to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> and enforce standards 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> medical records.</p>
<p>But this is now starting to change rapidly. Because of its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, 
              medicine has been slower than some other fields to fully embrace 
              the computer. By the end of the decade, however, I believe we will 
              find medicine as the profession taking best advantage of knowledge-based 
              technology. There are many factors for this impending transformation: 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, the ubiquity of inexpensive computers, the advent 
              of portable computing, and a broad array of advances in computerized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that affect all phases of medicine.</p>
<p>The Internet is already a powerful force changing the relationship 
              between doctors and patients. Patients are increasingly knowledgeable 
              about medical issues as a result of the thousands of medical Web 
              sites and discussion groups, although the reliability of much of 
              the information is a legitimate concern. Increasingly, patients 
              come into their visits armed with information that they want to 
              review. Although dealing with misinformation is an issue, most doctors 
              I&#8217;ve talked to find that increased patient knowledge results 
              in greater compliance with treatment and lifestyle recommendations, 
              because the patients have a greater understanding of the implications 
              of their condition. Many doctors are using the Web and e-mail as 
              means of communicating with their patients. Although these new modalities 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> can be very effective, they can also create new 
              dilemmas (e.g., how should a doctor handle the potential for an 
              e-mail being sent by a patient complaining of chest pain at 3 a.m.?)</p>
<p>We are in the early stages of many other <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> trends. Telemedicine 
              is used as doctors share imaging data over the Internet and engage 
              in videoconferencing to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> expertise in other geographical areas. 
              Automated <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> is starting to be used in identifying 
              areas of interest in electrocardiograms (particularly the lengthy 
              24-hour Holter tapes) and blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> analyses. Databases that provide 
              information on drug interactions are coming into general use. The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human genome project</a> has revealed the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> genetic data needed 
              to launch an almost limitless <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of inquiries and practical 
              applications. Microchip technology is being used to analyze <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              samples for specific <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s and strands of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. Viable electronic 
              medical records are emerging. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> systems, which include 
              haptic (i.e., tactile) <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s are used in training surgeons 
              and even in certain types of surgery.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider how these trends will manifest themselves over 
              the next decade: it is now the year 2012.</p>
<p>Computers have essentially disappeared and are no longer contained 
              in little rectangular boxes. <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">Personal computer</a>s have become, well, 
              very personal. The computer &#8220;display&#8221; is now built into 
              the user&#8217;s eyeglasses and contact lenses, which paint images 
              directly onto the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>. Similarly discreet devices provide two-way 
              auditory communication. We are plugged into the Web at all times 
              through very high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connections. And all of the 
              electronics required are built into our eyeglasses and woven into 
              our clothing.</p>
<p>Virtual displays (created by the &#8220;direct eye&#8221; displays) 
              hover in the air (and can be seen through) as we walk around. Alternatively, 
              these display lenses allow users to enter full-immersion virtual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> environments, where they can interact with other people: 
              patients, other doctors involved in a case, and remote medical experts, 
              none of whom need to be physically proximate. Specialized haptic 
              devices even allow physical examinations from afar. It&#8217;s now 
              possible for medical technicians with relatively inexpensive equipment 
              to bring health care to remote areas.</p>
<p>Doctors routinely train in virtual reality environments that simulate 
              the visual, auditory, and tactile <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of medical procedures, 
              including surgery. The virtual environments allow interacting with 
              physically remote patients, but simulated patients are also available. 
              With a simulated patient, a medical student (or a physician taking 
              a continuing medical <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> course, or even a high school student 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> what it&#8217;s like to be a doctor) can engage in a complete 
              simulated doctor&#8211;patient encounter, diagnose a condition, and 
              recommend a treatment. He or she can then fast forward to the next 
              encounter with that patient (which can be a few&#8212;simulated&#8212;hours 
              or months later) and see how things turned out.</p>
<p>Microchip-based protein and gene analysis systems allow thousands 
              of tests to be rapidly administered in a doctor&#8217;s office as 
              well as at home. Computer-based pattern recognition is routinely 
              used to interpret imaging data and blood cell analysis. The resolution 
              and bandwidth of noninvasive imaging technologies have greatly improved 
              and are used ubiquitously, with diagnosis involving a collaboration 
              between the human physician and a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-recognition&#8211;based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>.</p>
<p>Lifetime patient records are maintained in computer databases, 
              and trend analyses for critical medical variables (e.g., blood pressure, 
              hormone levels) are readily available. <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">Privacy</a> concerns about access 
              to these records (as with many other databases of personal information) 
              continue to be a major issue.</p>
<p>Doctors routinely consult knowledge-based systems, which provide 
              automated guidance, access to the most recent medical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, 
              and practice guidelines. Practice guidelines are <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed as 
              expert systems that provide automated suggestions and not just as 
              written documents.</p>
<p>As a doctor examines a patient (who may be hundreds or thousands 
              of miles away), he or she views well-organized displays of relevant 
              information on always present visual displays. All of the currently 
              relevant examination and test data are displayed (and seen hovering 
              in the air), as are all relevant trends. The doctor interacts with 
              this invisible computer either by speaking to it or by manipulating 
              a special <a class="thought" href="entries/handheld_entry.html">handheld</a> device. In addition to patient data, the doctor 
              can see tentative diagnoses and treatment recommendations from the 
              automated diagnostic and practice guideline systems. If the doctor 
              wants to share certain information with the patient (e.g., &#8220;look 
              at how your blood pressure has improved over the past week&#8221;), 
              a relevant graph or other display can be sent to the patient&#8217;s 
              own computerized display. Commands to the computerized systems to 
              accomplish these tasks can be given in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> voice commands 
              (e.g., &#8220;send blood pressure graph to Sally&#8221;), or, when 
              the doctor wants to communicate with his or her own computer display 
              discreetly, a handheld communicator could be used.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> revolution, which was only coming into its own 
              in 2002, is now in full swing. The toll from the major killers of 
              2002&#8212;heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, stroke, diabetes&#8212;have been 
              greatly reduced, and these diseases are becoming manageable chronic 
              conditions. Anti-aging treatments are becoming available, and bioengineering 
              now appears to be extending the human <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span by more than a year 
              every year.</p>
<p>Surgery now typically uses a virtual reality system that allows 
              the surgeon to view a site of surgery that is inside the patient 
              from outside the patient. The virtual reality system can also greatly 
              increase the apparent size of the surgery site. For example, tiny 
              nerves and blood vessels can be made to appear tens or even hundreds 
              of times larger, so that the surgeon can use large physical movements 
              to control very small precise movements of robotic manipulators 
              that are in contact with the patient&#8217;s tissues.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">Neural implant</a>s for sensory disorders (e.g., improved cochlear, 
              auditory cortex, and <a class="thought" href="entries/retinal_implant_entry.html">retinal implant</a>s) are widely used, as are neural 
              implants for certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s 
              disease and a variety of tremor-causing conditions. Using the robotic 
              virtual reality surgical systems, these implants can be introduced 
              using minimally invasive procedures.</p>
<p>Patients who share medical conditions and concerns frequently meet 
              with each other in virtual reality meetings. Patients are increasingly 
              knowledgeable about their own health conditions. There has been 
              a great deal of consolidation of health-related Web sites, and authoritative 
              sites that have the confidence of both doctors and patients have 
              emerged. This allows patients to take increasing responsibility 
              for their own health and lifestyle choices and allows physicians 
              to take the role of knowledgeable guides to an increasingly complex 
              world of medical technology.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It seems fantastic that if you can live another 10 years and wind up in reasonable health at that time, life expectancy will increase faster than you can age. Using the law of accerating returns, a person who is in good health at age 70, ten years from now, could theoretically live indefinately. This assumes, of course, that said person has the resources and desire to continually update one's aging biological organism with the appropriate technology as it becomes available. 
<br>
<br>
I think this is entirely possible. However, the element of risk still remains for all of us. Among other things, medical doctors are human and frequently make mistakes. In addition, some of the technology which appears promising initially, may prove fatal. 
<br>
<br>
However, I remain optimistic for those of us who stay informed and up to date. Especially those who take the time to understand the risk/reward ratio of any new technology and act with the knowledge that Doctors offices and Hospitals are dangerous places.</p></td>

I didn't mean to imply that immortality was a given in 10 years based upon Kurzweil's theories.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>i like to liken it to economics.
<br>
economics attempts to model impossibly complex things.
<br>
looking into the singularity is similar.
<br>
its like asking an insect to evaluate the stock exchange.
<br>
it is asking mere humans to peer into an opacity.
<br>
you can sort of feel for it, but you wont get too far.
<br>
there are many interesting suspicions.
<br>
early Sing eventuations probably contain biological plasticization.
<br>
and then deliberate lifeform design.
<br>
i look forward to golden dragons.
<br>
and pteradactyls.
<br>
and possibly chimaeras.
<br>
griffons for sure.
<br>
possibly medusas.
<br>
certainly poseidons.
<br>
hopefully monsters.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>If you drive a car and observe all the rules of the highway, stick to the speed limit, never overtake unless you are certain it is safe to do so, keep a suitable distance between you and the driver in front and so on..by the immutable Sod's Law you will still very likely have an accident. But I still say it's worth driving as if you are responsible for your safety.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, while I fully expect to keel over and die, I still say it's worthwhile treating your body and mind as if infirmity were the results of lifestyle choices, rather than the inevitabilities of passing time. A fatalistic attitude of 'since I have to die I might as well enjoy another cream donut' ignores the vastly improved sense of wellbeing that you achieve when you work WITH your body, rather than against it. 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is too much to hope that the radical life expectancies projected by the likes of Kurzweil come to pass for my generation. But I don't think it's too much to ask that, by the time I am 80, I will be like Chuck Yeager (who is still able to fly supersonic jet fighters) rather than my grandfather (who sits in a chair all day insisting he is 'not long for this world'- a claim he has been making for the past decade).

'It is one of the most remarkable things in all of the biological sciences that there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicated the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable'- R. Feynman.</p></td>

One problem with this idea is conflicting information. How many times have you read that 'something you thought was bad has now been found to be good' and vice versa? Vitamins for example. According to 'Fantastic Voyage' we could all do with megadoses of vitamins and minerals, but other sources say megadoses of vitamins and minerals increase the likelyhood of cancer:(</p></td>
