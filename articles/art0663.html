            <div class="TeaserText">"Individuals are getting more and more powerful," says author Glenn Reynolds in his insightful new book, An Army of Davids. "With the current rate of progress we're seeing in biotechnology, nanotechnology,
              artificial intelligence, and other technologies, it seems likely that individuals will one day--and one day relatively soon--possess powers once thought available only to nation-states, superheroes, or gods. That sounds dramatic, but
              we're already partway there"--and nanotechnology may be the "ultimate empowerer of ordinary people."</div>

            <p>All sorts of new technologies promise to empower <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, but
              the ultimate empowerer of ordinary people may well turn out to be
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, the much-hyped but still <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>
              of
              molecular manufacturing and computing. Indeed, for all the nano-hype,
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of nanotechnology may turn out to exceed the claims.
              The result may be as big a change as the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>,
              but in a different direction.</p>
            <p>Nanotechnology derives its name from the nanometer, or a billionth
              of a meter, and refers to the manipulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> at the atomic
              and molecular level. The ideas behind nanotechnology are simple
              ones: every substance on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> is made up of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s composed
              of one or more atoms (the smallest <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s). To describe
              the molecules that constitute a physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> and how they interrelate
              is to say nearly everything important about the object. It follows,
              then, that if you can manipulate individual atoms and molecules
              and put them together in certain <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s, you should be able
              to create just about anything you desire. And if technologies like
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> have empowered individuals by giving
              them drastically more control over the organization of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>,
              the impact of nanotechnology&#8212;which promises similar control
              over the material world&#8212;is likely to be much greater. This
              goes well beyond home-brewing beer, though, as with making beer,
              nanotechnology involves letting someone else do the hard work at
              the microscopic level.</p>
            <p><a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>'s first description of nanotechnology still serves:</p>
            <p><i>The principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, as far as I can see, do not speak
                against the possibility of maneuvering things <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by atom.... [I]t
                would be, in principle, possible for a physicist to synthesize any
                chemical substance that the chemist writes down. How? Put the atoms
                down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance. The
                problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> can be greatly helped if our ability
                to see what we are doing, and to do things on an atomic level, is
                ultimately developed&#8212;a development which I think cannot be
                avoided.</i><sup><a name="ref1"></a><a href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>
            <p>Modern nanotechnology <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers want to go beyond synthesizing
              "substances" (though that has great importance) to use nanotechnology's
              atom-by-atom construction techniques to produce objects: tiny, bacterium-sized
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can repair clogged arteries, kill <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells, fix
              cellular damage from aging, and (via what are called "<a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s")
              make other devices of greater size or <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> by plugging atoms,
              one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, into the desired arrangements, very quickly. Other
              researchers believe that nanotechnology will allow for a degree
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> that might permit computers a millionfold more
              efficient than anything available now. Still others believe that
              nanotechnology's tiny devices will be able to unravel mysteries
              of the microscopic world (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> metabolism, the aging process,
              and cancer) in ways that other tools will not be able to.</p>
            <p>So far, pioneers like Eric Drexler and <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a> have worked
              out a lot of the details, and research has produced some small devices,
              but nothing as exotic as those described above. But <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologists
              are refining both their <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ation and their understanding
              of nanofabrication at an accelerating rate. Will they be able to
              fulfill the field's promise? Richard Feynman <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> so. That raises
              a lot of interesting possibilities&#8212;and questions.</p>
            <p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> revolution brought us a debate over the difference
              between <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> and physical reality, a distinction the
              courts are still trying to figure out. But we are also at the dawn
              of a new technological revolution&#8212;the nanotech revolution&#8212;that
              may challenge our definition of what physical reality is. Superman
              could create diamonds by squeezing lumps of coal, using heat and
              pressure to rearrange the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms. Nanotechnology could achieve
              the same transformation, with considerably less fuss, simply by
              plugging carbon atoms together, one at a time, in the correct manner&#8212;and
              without the embarrassing blue tights.</p>
            <p>This sounds like the stuff of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, and it is: In Michael
              Crichton's thriller, <i>Prey</i>, nanotech plays the bad guy. But
              in real <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, nanotech is already being used by everyone from Lee
              Jeans, which uses nanofibers to make stain-proof pants, to the U.S.
              <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>, which uses nanotechnology to make better catalysts for
              rockets and missiles, to scientists who are using nano-technology
              to develop workable artificial kidneys.<sup><a name="ref2"></a><a href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
            <h3 align="center">"JUST ADD SUNLIGHT AND DIRT"</h3>
            <p>Many scientists initially doubted that nanotechnology's precise
              positioning of molecules was possible, but that skepticism appears
              to have been misplaced. That's no surprise, really, since living
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s, including our own bodies, make things like bone and muscle
              by manipulating individual atoms and molecules. Yet as criticism
              has shifted from claims that nanotechnology won't work to fears
              that it might, there have been calls to stop <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the field
              of nanotechnology before research really gets off the ground. The
              ETC Group, an anti-technology organization operating out of Canada,
              has proposed a moratorium on nanotechnology research and on research
              into self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. (At the moment, the latter is like
              calling for a moratorium on antigravity or faster-than-<a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> travel&#8212;nobody's
              doing it anyway.)</p>
            <p>Proponents of this line of criticism face an uphill battle. What's
              attractive about devices that can be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to manipulate molecules
              is that they let you make virtually anything you want, and you can
              generally make it out of cheap and commonly available materials
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>&#8212;what nanotech enthusiasts call "sunlight and dirt."
              Selectively sticky probes on tiny bacterium-scale arms, attached
              either to tiny robots or to a <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> and controlled by
              computer, can grab the atoms they need from solution, and then plug
              them together in the proper configuration. It's not quite molecular
              Legos, but it's close. General purpose devices that can do this
              are called "assemblers," and the process is known among nanotechnology
              proponents as "molecular manufacturing."</p>
            <p>This process raises some problems of its own, though. Assemblers
              that can manufacture virtually anything from sunlight and dirt might,
              as the result of a program error, manufacture endless copies of
              themselves, which would then go on to make still more copies, and
              so on. The fear that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s might turn the world into mush is
              known in the trade as the "gray goo problem," the apocalyptic scenario
              raised in Crichton's <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>.</p>
            <p>Nanotech's backers, however, believe the real problem won't be
              accident, but abuse. With mature nanotechnology, it might be possible
              to disassemble enemy <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s. (Imagine bacterium-sized devices that
              convert high explosives into inert substances, a technique that
              would neutralize even nuclear weapons, whose detonators are made
              of chemical high explosive.) On a more threatening note, sophisticated
              nanodevices could serve as artificial "<a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>" agents of great
              power and subtlety. Highly sophisticated nanorobots could even hide
              out in people's brains, manipulating their neurochemistry to ensure
              that they genuinely loved Big Brother. Like nuclear weapons, these
              devices would be awesome in their destructiveness, and their misuse
              would be terrifying. Still, the race to harness this power is well
              underway: Defense spending on nanotechnology is climbing, and civilian
              spending is over $1 billion a year.<sup><a name="ref3"></a><a href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
            <p>In a world in which the promises of nanotechnology were realized,
              practically anyone could live a life that would be extraordinary
              by today's standards, in terms of health (thanks to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>)
              and material possessions. <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> damaged by radiation, toxins, or aging
              could be repaired; arterial plaque could be removed; and cancerous
              or senescent cells could be destroyed or fixed. Organs could be
              replaced or even enhanced. Researcher Robert Freitas surveys many
              of these issues in his book <i>Nanomedicine</i>, which explores
              such topics as "respirocytes"&#8212;tiny devices in the bloodstream
              that could deliver <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> when the body wasn't able to, protecting
              against everything from drowning to heart attacks and strokes long
              enough to allow medical assistance. And this just scratches the
              surface in terms of potential enhancements, which might also involve
              stronger muscles, better nerves, and enhanced cognition&#8212;the
              last being the subject of an ongoing Department of Defense research
              project already.<a name="ref4"></a><sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
            <p>Most physical goods could be manufactured onsite at low cost from
              cheap raw materials. Imagine owning an appliance the size of a refrigerator,
              full of nanoassemblers, that ran on sunlight and dirt (well, solar
              electricity and cheap feedstocks, anyway) and made pretty much everything
              you need, from clothing to food. The widespread availability of
              such devices would make things very, very different. Material goods
              wouldn't be quite free, but they would be nearly so.</p>
            <p>In such a world, personal property would become almost meaningless.
              Some actual physical items would retain sentimental value, but everything
              else could be produced as needed, then recycled as soon as the need
              passed. (As someone who writes on a laptop that was cutting edge
              last year and is now old news, with its value discounted accordingly,
              I sometimes think we're already there except for the recycling part.
              Don't even ask about my <a class="thought" href="entries/mp3_entry.html">MP3</a> player.)</p>
            <p>Real property would retain its value&#8212;as my grandfather used
              to say, "They're not making any more of it," especially oceanfront
              acreage&#8212;but what would "value" mean? Value usually describes
              an object's ability to be exchanged for another item. But with personal
              property creatable on demand from sunlight and dirt, it's not clear
              what the medium of exchange would be. Value comes from scarcity,
              and most goods wouldn't be scarce. <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">Intellectual property</a>&#8212;the
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and designs used to program the nano&#173;devices&#8212;would
              be valuable, though once computing power became immense and ubiquitous,
              developing such designs wouldn't be likely to pose much of a challenge.</p>
            <p>One thing that would remain scarce is time. Personal services like
              teaching, lawyering, or prostitution wouldn't be cheapened in the
              same fashion. We might wind up with an economy based on the exchange
              of personal services more than on the purchase of goods. As I mentioned
              earlier, that's where we're headed already to a point. Even without
              nanotechnology, the prices of many goods are falling. Televisions,
              once expensive, are near-commodity goods, as are computers, stereos,
              and just about all other <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. It's cheaper to build new
              ones than to fix old ones, and prices continue to fall as capabilities
              increase. Nanotechnology would simply accelerate this trend and
              extend it to everything else. Ironically, it may be the combination
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> and technology that brings about a utopia unblemished
              by the need for ownership, the sort that socialists (usually no
              fans of capitalism) and romantics (no fans of technology) have long
              dreamed of.</p>
            <h3 align="center">PIONEERS' PROGRESS</h3>
            <p>We're not there yet, but things are progressing faster than even
              I had realized. Recently, I attended an EPA <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Advisory Board
              meeting where nanotechnology was discussed. What struck me is that
              even for people like me who try to keep up, the pace of nanotechnology
              research is moving much too fast to catch everything.</p>
            <p>One of the documents distributed at that meeting was a supplement
              to the president's budget request, entitled <i>National Nanotechnology
                Initiative: Research and Development Supporting the Next Industrial
                Revolution</i>.<a name="ref5"></a><sup><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>
              I expected it to be the usual bureaucratic pap, but in fact, it
              turned out to contain a lot of actual useful information, including
              reports of several nanotechnology developments that I had missed.</p>
            <p>The most interesting, to me, was the report of "peptide [ring]
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> that kill <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> by punching holes in the bacteria's
              membrane." You might think of these as a sort of mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>.
              As the report notes, "By controlling the type of peptides used to
              build the rings, scientists are able to design nanotubes that selectively
              perforate bacterial membranes without harming the cells of the host."<sup><a name="ref6"></a><a href="#f6">6</a></sup>
              It goes on to note, "In theory, these nano-bio agents should be
              far less prone than existing antibiotics to the development of bacterial
              resistance."<sup><a name="ref7"></a><a href="#f7">7</a></sup> What's
              more, if such resistance appears, it is likely to be easier to counter.
              Given the way in which resistance to conventional antibiotics has
              exploded, this is awfully good news.</p>
            <p>Another item involved the use of nanoscale particles of metallic
              iron to clean up contaminated groundwater. In one <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, aimed
              at the contaminant trichloroethylene (TCE), the results were quite
              impressive: "The researchers carried out a field demonstration at
              an industrial site in which nanoparticles injected into a groundwater
              plume containing TCE reduced contaminant levels by up to 96 percent."
              The report goes on to observe, "A wide variety of contaminants (including
              chlorinated hydrocarbons, pesticides, explosives, polychlorinated
              biphenyls and perchlorate) have been successfully broken down in
              both laboratory and field tests."<sup><a name="ref8"></a><a href="#f8">8</a></sup>
              Not too shabby.</p>
            <p>And there's more: the development of nanosensors capable of identifying
              particular microbes or chemicals, of nanomotors, and dramatic advances
              in materials. These advances shouldn't be underestimated.</p>
            <p>We tend to forget this, but it's possible for a technology to have
              revolutionary effects long before it reaches its maturity. The impact
              of high-strength materials, for example, is likely to be much greater
              than people generally realize. Materials science isn't sexy the
              way that, say, robots are sexy, but when you can cut the weight,
              or boost the strength, of aircraft, or spacecraft, or even automobiles
              by a factor of ten or fifty, the consequences are enormous. Ditto
              for killing germs, or even detecting them in short <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. These
              sorts of things aren't as exciting as true molecular manufacturing,
              and they're not as revolutionary, but they're still awfully important,
              and awfully revolutionary, by comparison with everything else.</p>
            <p>When I gave my talk at the Science Advisory Board, I divided nanotechnology
              into these categories:</p>
            <p>&#8226; Fake: where it's basically a marketing term, as with nanopants</p>
            <p>&#8226; Simple: high-strength materials, sensors, coatings, etc.&#8212;things
              that are important, but not sexy</p>
            <p>&#8226; Major: advanced devices short of true assemblers</p>
            <p> &#8226; Spooky: assemblers and related technology (true molecular
              nanotechnology, capable of making most anything from sunlight and
              dirt, creating <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s smaller than a sugar cube, etc.)</p>
            <p>I noted that only in the final category did serious ethical or
              regulatory issues appear, and also noted that the recent flood of
              "it's impossible" claims relating to "spooky" nanotechnology seem
              to have more to do with fear of ethical or regulatory scrutiny than
              anything else. People in the industry are hoping to keep the critics
              away with a smokescreen of doubt as to the capabilities of the technology.
              That probably won't work, especially as nanotechnology develops
              and is put to use in more and more ways.</p>
            <p>Up to now, talk of nanotechnology has generally involved either
              the "fake" variety (stain-resistant pants) or the "spooky" variety
              (full-scale molecular nanotechnology with all it implies). But as
              what might be called midlevel nanotechnology&#8212;neither fake nor
              spooky&#8212;begins to be deployed, it's likely to have a substantial
              effect on the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the debate. It's one thing to worry about
              (fictitious) swarms of predatory nanobots, a la Michael Crichton's
              novel <i>Prey</i>. It's another to talk about nanotech bans or moratoria
              when nanotechnology is already at work curing diseases and cleaning
              up the environment.</p>
            <h3 align="center"><a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">LEARNING</a> FROM <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">EXPERIENCE</a></h3>
            <p>I think that these positive uses will probably shift the debate
              away from the nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a>. But, on the other hand, as nanotechnology
              becomes commonplace, serious discussion of its implications may
              be short-<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ed. I think that the nanotech business community
              is actually hoping for such an outcome, in fact, but I continue
              to believe that such hopes are shortsighted. Genetically modified
              foods, for example, came to the market with the same absence of
              discussion, but the result wasn't so great for the industry. Will
              nanotechnology be different? Stay tuned. Whatever happens, I think
              that trying to stand still might well prove the most dangerous course
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>.</p>
            <p>This may seem surprising, but experience suggests that it's true.</p>
            <p>For an academic project I worked on awhile back, I reviewed the
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of what used to be called "recombinant DNA research" and
              is now generally just called genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering or <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.
              Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this was very controversial
              stuff, with opponents raising a variety of frightening possibilities.</p>
            <p>Not all the fears were irrational. We didn't know very much about
              how such things worked, and it was possible to imagine scary scenarios
              that at least seemed plausible. Indeed, such plausible fears led
              scientists in the field to get together, twice, holding conferences
              at Asilomar in California, to propose guidelines that would ensure
              the safety of recombinant DNA research until more was known.</p>
            <p>Those voluntary guidelines became the basis for <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> regulations,
              regulations that work so well that researchers often voluntarily
              submit their work to government review even when the law doesn't
              require it&#8212;and standard DNA licensing agreements often even
              call for such submission. Self-policing was their key element, and
              it worked.</p>
            <p> When the DNA research debate first started, scientific critics
              such as Erwin Chargaff met the notion of scientific self-regulation
              with skepticism. Chargaff predicted modern-day Frankensteins or
              "little <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> monsters" and compared the notion of scientific
              self-regulation to that of "incendiaries forming their own fire
              brigade." Such critics warned that the harms that might result from
              permitting such research were literally incalculable, and thus it
              should not be allowed.</p>
            <p>Others took a different view. Physicist Freeman Dyson, who admitted
              that (as a physicist, not a biologist) he had no personal stake
              in the debate, noted, "The real benefit to humanity from recombinant
              DNA will probably be the one no one has dreamed of. Our ignorance
              lies equally on both arms of the balance. The public costs of saying
              no to further development may in the end be far greater than the
              costs of saying yes." Harvard's Matthew Meselson agreed. The risk
              of not going forward, he argued, was the risk of being left open
              to "forthcoming catastrophes," in the form of starvation (which
              could be addressed by crop biotechnology) and the spread of new
              viruses. Critics like Chargaff pooh-poohed this view, saying that
              the promise of the new technology to alleviate such problems was
              unproven.<sup><a name="ref9"></a><a href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
            <p>Meselson and Dyson have been vindicated. Indeed, Meselson's comments
              about "forthcoming catastrophes" were made (though no one knew it
              at the time) just as AIDS was beginning to spread around the world.
              Without the tools developed through biotechnology and genetic engineering,
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Immunodeficiency <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">Virus</a> could not even have been identified,
              and treatment efforts would have been limited. Had we listened to
              the critics, in other words, it's likely that many more people would
              have died. Meanwhile, the critics' Frankensteinian fears have not
              come true, and the research that was feared then has become commonplace,
              as this excerpt from John Hockenberry's DNA Files program on NPR
              illustrates:</p>
            <p><i><b>Hockenberry:</b> In those early days [Arthur] Caplan says
                people were concerned about what would happen if we tried to genetically
                engineer different bacteria.</i></p>
            <p><i><b>Caplan:</b> The mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, at one
                point said he was worried if there were scientific institutions
                in his town that were doing this, he didn't want to see sort of
                Frankenstein-type microbes coming out of the sewers.</i></p>
            <p><i><b>Hockenberry:</b> Today those early concerns seem almost quaint.
                Now even high school biology classes like this one in Maine do the
                same gene combining experiments that once struck fear into the hearts
                of public officials and private citizens.</i><sup><a name="ref10"></a><a href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
            <p>This experience suggests that we need to pay close attention to
              the downsides of limiting scientific research, and that we need
              to scrutinize the claims of fearmongering critics every <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> as carefully
              as the claims of optimistic boosters. This is especially true at
              the moment, because, arguably, we're in a window of vulnerability
              where many technologies are concerned. For example, in 2002 researchers
              at SUNY-Stony Brook synthesized a virus using a <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> and a genetic map <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed from the Internet. This
              wasn't really news from a technical standpoint (I remember a scientist
              telling me in 1999 that anyone with a protein synthesizer and a
              computer could do such a thing), but many found it troubling.<sup><a name="ref11"></a><a href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
            <p>But at the moment, it's troubling because we know more about viruses
              than about their cures, meaning that it's easier to cause trouble
              by making viruses than it is to remedy viruses once made. In another
              decade or two, depending on the pace of research, developing a vaccine
              or cure will be just as easy. That being the case, doesn't it make
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to progress as rapidly as possible, to minimize the timespan
              in which we're at risk? It does to me.</p>
            <p>Critics of biotechnology feel otherwise. But their track record
              hasn't been very impressive so far. What's more interesting is who's
              not criticizing nanotechnology. Typically Luddite Greenpeace, for
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, has been surprisingly moderate in its response. The environmental
              organization has sponsored a report entitled "<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Technologies,
              Today's Choices: Nanotechnology, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a>;
              A Technical, Political and Institutional Map of Emerging Technologies"<a name="ref12"></a><sup><a href="#f12">12</a></sup>
              that looks rather extensively at nanotechnology.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, the report rejects the idea of a moratorium on nanotechnology,
              despite calls to squelch nanotech from other environmental groups.
              Instead, it finds that a moratorium on nanotechnology research "seems
              both unpractical and probably damaging at present."<sup><a name="ref13"></a><a href="#f13">13</a></sup>
              The report also echoes warnings from others that such a moratorium
              might simply drive nanotechnology research underground.</p>
            <p>Though overlooked in the few news stories to cover the report,
              this finding is significant. With a moratorium taken off the table,
              the question then becomes one of how, not whether, to develop nanotechnology.
              The report also takes a rather balanced view of the technology's
              prospects. It notes that there has been a tendency to blur the distinction
              between nanoscale technologies of limited long-term importance (e.g.,
              stain-resistant "nanopants") and build-anything general assembler
              devices and other sophisticated nanotechnologies, so as to make
              incremental work look sexier than it is. This is important: the
              report's not-entirely-unreasonable worries about the dangers of
              nanomaterials are distinguishable from more science-fictional concerns
              of the Crichton variety. (Remember, Crichton rhymes with "frighten.")
              Thus, it will be harder for Greenpeace to conflate the two kinds
              of concerns itself, as has been done in the struggle against genetically
              modified foods where opponents have often mixed minor-but&#173;proven
              threats with major-but-bogus ones in a rather promiscuous fashion.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it seems to me that nano-blogger Howard Lovy is right in
              saying, "Take out the <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> words and phrases that are tailored to
              Greenpeace's audience, and you'll find some sound advice in there
              for the nanotech industry."<sup><a name="ref14"></a><a href="#f14">14</a></sup>
              Greenpeace is calling for more research into safety. Now is a good
              time to do that&#8212;even for the industry, which currently doesn't
              have a lot of products at risk. Quite a few responsible nanotechnology
              researchers are calling for this kind of research as well. Such
              research is likely to do more good than harm at blocking Luddite
              efforts to turn nanotechnology into a political football&#8212;the
              next Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) derived food. Despite the
              vast promise of GMO foods (including vitamin-enhanced "golden rice"
              that can prevent widespread blindness among Third-World children),
              environmentalist hostility and fearmongering has kept most of them
              out of the market. As Rice University researcher Vicki Colvin noted
              in congressional testimony:</p>
            <p><i>The campaign against GMOs was successful despite the lack of
                sound scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> demonstrating a threat to <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. In fact,
                I argue that the lack of sufficient public scientific data on GMOs,
                whether positive or negative, was a controlling factor in the industry's
                fall from favor. The failure of the industry to produce and share
                information with public stakeholders left it ill-equipped to respond
                to GMO detractors. This industry went, in essence, from "wow" to
                "yuck" to "bankrupt." There is a powerful lesson here for nanotechnology.</i><sup><a name="ref15"></a><a href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
            <p>She's right, and the nanotechnology industry would do well to learn
              from the failings she outlines. As I noted above, some companies
              and researchers have tended to dismiss the prospects for advanced
              nanotechnology in the hopes of avoiding the attention of environmental
              activists. That obviously isn't working. The best defense against
              nano-critics is good, solid scientific information, not denial&#8212;especially
              given the strong promise of nanotechnology in terms of environmental
              improvement.</p>
            <p>Nanotechnology legislation recently passed by Congress calls for
              some investigation into these issues of safety and <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>. I hope
              that there will be more emphasis on exploring both the scientific
              and the ethical issues involved in nanotechnology's <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>. That
              sort of exploration&#8212;done by serious people, not the charlatans
              and fearmongers who are sure to target the area regardless&#8212;will
              be important in making nanotechnology succeed.</p>
            <p>The critics won't shut up, of course, but some aspects of their
              criticism will have more weight than others, leaving the scaremongering
              less influential than the scaremongers hope. And if that's not enough,
              the argument for nanotechnology's role in maintaining military supremacy
              is likely to rear its head. Nanotechnology is likely to be as important
              in the twenty-first century as rocketry or nuclear physics were
              in the twentieth. The United States has a fairly competent nanotechnology
              research program, though many feel its efforts are misdirected.
              Europe has a substantial but comparatively muted one. Other countries
              seem very interested indeed.</p>
            <p>In the United States, and especially in Europe, research into nanotechnology
              is facing growing resistance from the same forces that have opposed
              biotechnology&#8212;and, for that matter, nuclear energy and other
              new technologies. The claim is that concerns about the safety and
              morality of nanotechnology justify limitations on research and development.
              Even Prince Charles has weighed in against nanotechnology, although
              Ian Bell wonders if the real fuss is about something other than
              the science:</p>
            <p><i>Charles is afraid that the science could, yes, run amok, with
                minuscule robots reproducing themselves and proceeding to turn the
                world into "<a class="thought" href="entries/grey_goo_entry.html">grey goo</a>."</i></p>
            <p><i>Many might suspect that the only grey goo we have to worry about
                is between the ears of HRH, but scientists fear that the prince
                could do to them what he did to the reputation of contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>.
                Charles, clearly, can have no way of knowing what he is talking
                about, but the fear he expresses is common: do any of us really
                know what we are doing when we follow where science leads?</i><sup><a name="ref16"></a><a href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
            <p>The real problem isn't a distrust of science. It's a distrust of
              people. Such fear is strongest when pessimism about humanity is
              at a high. Europe, perhaps understandably pessimistic about humanity's
              prospects in light of recent history, leads the way in throwing
              some people's only favored <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>&#8212;the wet blanket&#8212;over
              nanotechnology research.</p>
            <p>In the more optimistic United States, concerns exist, but they
              haven't yet led to a strong interest in regulating nanotechnology.
              Instead, the U.S. takes an ostrich-like approach to dealing with
              the realities of the technology; scientific and <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> types
              try to shift the focus to short-term technological developments
              while scoffing at the prospects for genuine molecular manufacturing&#8212;the
              "spooky" stuff, as I've labeled it. Some promising developments
              are taking place, both at the National Nanotechnology Initiative
              and within the nanotechnology industry itself, but it's still too
              early to tell whether this turnaround will really take hold.</p>
            <h3 align="center">MANDARINS AND MEMORIES</h3>
            <p>In the meantime, other cultures, unencumbered by the residual belief
              in original sin plaguing even the most secular Westerners, show
              far less reluctance. Perhaps they are less comfortable and more
              ambitious than we are, as well. Chinese interest in military nanotechnology
              has begun to alarm some, especially as China is already third in
              the world in nanotechnology <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> applications.<a name="ref17"></a><sup><a href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>
            <p> India's president, Abdul Kalam, is also touting nanotechnology,
              and as a recent press account captured, he's quite straightforward
              in saying that one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for treating nanotechnology as important
              is that it will lead to revolutionary weaponry:</p>
            <p><i>[Kalam] said carbon nano tubes and its composites would give
                rise to super strong, smart and intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s in the field
                of material science and this in turn could lead to new production
                of nano robots with new types of explosives and sensors for air,
                land and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. "This would revolutionise the total <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s
                of future <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a>," he said.</i><sup><a name="ref18"></a><a href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
            <p>Yes, it would. Westerners tend to forget it, but it was a few key
              technologies&#8212;primarily steam navigation and repeating firearms&#8212;that
              made the era of Western colonialism possible. (See Daniel Headrick's
              <i>The Tools of Empire</i><sup><a name="ref19"></a><a href="#f19">19</a></sup>
              for more on this.)</p>
            <p>It is, no doubt, as hard for American and European Mandarins to
              imagine being conquered by Chinese troops equipped with superior
              weaponry as it was for Chinese Mandarins to imagine the reverse
              two hundred years ago. Will our mandarins be smart enough to learn
              from that experience? That's the question, isn't it?</p>
            <p>But in the long run, the growth of nanotechnology means that we
              won't just be worrying about countries, but about individuals. With
              mature nanotechnology, individuals and small groups will possess
              powers once available only to nation-states. As with all powers
              possessed by individuals, these will sometimes be used for good,
              and sometimes for ill.</p>
            <p>Of course, that's just an extension of existing phenomena. My own
              neighborhood has a few dozen families in it; between them, they
              probably have enough guns and motorized vehicles (conveniently,
              mostly SUVs) to wipe out a Roman legion, or a Mongol horde&#8212;forces
              that, in both cases, once represented the peak of military power
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. Nobody worries about the military power that my neighborhood
              represents, because it's (1) unlikely to be misused, and (2) negligible
              in a world where most anyone can afford guns and SUVs anyway.</p>
            <p>What this suggests is that a world in which nanotechnology is ubiquitous
              is likely to be less threatening than one in which it's a closely
              held government monopoly. A world in which nanotechnology is ubiquitous
              is a rich world. That doesn't preclude bad behavior, but it helps.
              A world with such diffuse power makes abuse by smaller groups, or
              even governments, less threatening overall. The average Roman or
              Mongolian citizen didn't really need guns or SUVs. Back then, the
              hobbyist machine shop in my neighbor's basement would have been
              a tool of strategic, even world-changing, importance all by itself.
              Now, in a different world, it's just a toy, even though it could,
              in theory, produce dangerous weaponry. It's probably best if nano-technology
              works out the same way, with diffusion minimizing the risk that
              anyone will gain disproportionate power over the rest of us.</p>
            <p>In his recent book, <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> Is Near</i>, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>
              notes that technology often suffices to deal with technological
              threats, even in the absence of governmental intervention:</p>
            <p><i>When [the computer virus] first appeared, strong concerns were
                voiced that as they became more sophisticated, software <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s
                had the potential to destroy the computer-<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> medium in which
                they live. Yet the "<a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>" that has evolved in response
                to this challenge has been largely effective. Although destructive
                self-replicating software entities do cause damage from time to
                time, the injury is but a small fraction of the benefit we receive
                from the computers and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s links that harbor them.<a name="ref20"></a></i><sup><a href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
            <p>Software viruses, of course, aren't usually a lethal threat. But
              Kurzweil notes that this cuts both ways:</p>
            <p><i>The fact that computer viruses are not usually deadly to humans
                only means that more people are willing to create and release them.
                The vast majority of software-virus authors would not release viruses
                if they thought they would kill people. It also means that our response
                to the danger is that much less intense. Conversely, when it comes
                to self-replicating entities that are potentially lethal on a large
                scale, our response on all levels will be vastly more serious.<a name="ref21"></a></i><sup><a href="#f21">21</a></sup></p>
            <p>I think that's right. In fact, prophetic works of science fiction&#8212;Neal
              Stephenson's <i>The Diamond Age</i>, for instance&#8212;generally
              feature such defensive technologies against rogue nanotechnology.
              Given the greater threat potential of nanotechnologies, we may have
              to rely on more than Symantec and McAfee for protection&#8212;but
              on the other hand, given the huge benefits promised by nanotechnology,
              we should be willing to go ahead anyway. And I expect we will.</p>

                    <br>
                    there is some mixing between what technology can give and its limition as it is made by humans not by gods.which mean what ever it will be developed it will never be perfect ot give little guys (GOD) power
                    <br>
                    (GOD) (CREATED) us from nothing
                    <br>
                    but nano technology needs atoms to manipulate
                    <br>
                    every thing compared to (GOD) equal zero
                    <br>
                    in (ISLAM) we say ( ALLAH AKBAR) (ALLAH ) is name for ( GOD) it means ( AALAH IS THE GREATER)
                    <br>
                    (GOD IS THE GREATER ) why not say ( GOD IS THE GREATEST)
                    <br>
                    because every thing in universe is limited in its power while (GOD POWER) is not limited
                    <br>
                    and in mathimaticsevery thing limited compared to unlimited its value equal zero and snce every thin in world is limited in front of (GOD THE MIGHTY) then they are all qual zero
                    <br>
                    which means as they are equal in value they can be put togther as one zero compare to only
                    <br>
                    (THE ONE MIGHTY GOD ALLAH ) (THE GOD ) of people in all the three relgeions (THE CHRISTIAN ,THE JEWISH and ISLAM)
                    <br>
                    our say in (ISLAM )(ALLAH IS THE GRATER)
                    <br>
                    and scentific evidence which i mentioned before support our religeion and others should look at with respect if they donot want to brlive it.
                    <br>
                    and it indicates that we should npt drop religeion for science
                    <br>
                    our faith comes first and our science is mean to know better under umbrella of (WORSHIP ) of (GOD)
                    <br>
                    (WHICH IS THE BASE) since ( GOD CARRYS ) with its ( POWER) our happines if we (obey GOD)

                  <p> The present terrorist war is about shifting technologies, with individuals able to challenge nation-states, which are on the decline. I predicted at the beginning of the Iraq war that the terrorists would attack sporadically,
                    study our response, and then use altered attacks to see how we dealt with that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, they are using more advanced wepons and the number of people seems to be increasing, especially Americans. They will watch our response to that, study a counter-strategy, and employ it to see how we respond.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of course we're reacting because we have direct feedback via telecommunications, which means that our government will be forced into change and will have to respond using more indirect methods. Intelligence is being developed via
                    the process of war, as it always has in history.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The idea of destroying viruses, however, might not work so well, simply because we're now discovering that viruses, and in fact all disease, amy well be a process by which we can adapt quickly to change.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Viruses have modeled our evolution by informing organisms and working i n evolutionary symbiosis.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A very good bok to read on this is "Survival of the Sickest".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think there may be a web page: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011040816/http://www.survivalofthesickestthebook.com/" target="_blank">http://www.survivalofthesickestthebook.com</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If nanotechnology is to proceed, we're going to have to study biology's "nanobots" and see how they have interacted with us to create intelligent replication. The more we learn about this process, the more at ease I'll feel.</p>

                    <br>
                    "I predicted at the beginning of the Iraq war that the terrorists would attack sporadically, study our response, and then use altered attacks to see how we dealt with that."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yes, that's how Guerrilla, or Fourth Generation Warfare, works.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the people you're fighting are not "terrorists", and they would not be attacking your soldiers if they weren't in Iraq. They are Resistance Fighters, and their actions are legitimate according to the same international laws
                    the criminals who started this war violated.

                  <p> I have no arguments against your statements, Pilgrim. My main point was to des cribe a process that parallels biological processes, which is what warfare comes to resemble more as we enter an information processing age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It seems to me the war is not about "good versus evil" but about mechanical versus biological processes. In the past, the mechanical process has dominated. Today, the "resistance fighters" are capable of using the latest
                    technology as effectively or more effectively than we are.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    War has always been a kind of evolutionary learning curve, and this war uses learning and intelligence as its most basic weapons.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we get caught up in the "us versus them" idea, we miss the whole process and become the evolutionary by-products of history. Recognize what is actually happening, and we are prepared to instill true intelligence for future
                    generations.</p>

                  <p>That's an interesting way of looking at it.

                    "Today, the "resistance fighters" are capable of using the latest technology as effectively or more effectively than we are."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Or using outdated technology to greater effect than the occupying forces are able to utilize the somewhat combersome latest gadgetry, proving that human intellect and strategy are still more effective than all the "smart" weapons
                    you can create.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (Let's not forget what Sun Tzu said about people defending themselves from a Foreign Aggressor, either ... The Iraqis have that going for them.)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "War has always been a kind of evolutionary learning curve"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think the greatest thing we can possibly learn from each war is not to make war, or empower people who plan to make war, as war is a failure in and of itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Recognize what is actually happening, and we are prepared to instill true intelligence for future generations."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this case, I think what has happened is that we've failed to safeguard our halls of power (which even I view as necessary) from the types of people we KNOW have no place within them.

                    "Nanotechnology" is utopia.

                    Utopia would be a uniformly positive society. Nanotechnology will solve some problems but introduce new ones; make life better for some but worse for others.

                    <br>
