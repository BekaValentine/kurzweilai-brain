<br><blockquote>The world stands on the threshold of a second <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> age. New <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> now moving out of the laboratory is starting to change the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> from a fantastically fast calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that mimics <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes - giving <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s the capability to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, make judgments, and even learn. Already this <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is performing tasks once <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to require <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>...</blockquote>
<blockquote>- BUSINESS WEEK</blockquote>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">COMPUTER</a>S have emerged from back rooms and laboratories to help with writing, calculating, and play in homes and offices. These <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s do simple, repetitive tasks, but <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s still in the laboratory do much more. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers say that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can be made smart, and fewer and fewer people disagree. To understand our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, we must see whether <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is as impossible as flying to the Moon. </p>
<p>&#160;Thinking <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s need not resemble <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings in shape, purpose, or mental skills. Indeed, some <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will show few traits of the intelligent liberal arts graduate, but will instead serve only as powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s of design. Nonetheless, understanding how <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds evolved from mindless <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> will shed <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> on how <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can be made to think. Minds, like other forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, evolved through variation and selection. </p>
<p>&#160;Minds act. One need not embrace Skinnerian behaviorism to see the importance of behavior, including the internal behavior called <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> replicating in test tubes shows how the idea of purpose can apply (as a kind of shorthand) to utterly mindless <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. They lack nerves and muscles, but they have evolved to "behave" in ways that promote their replication. Variation and selection have shaped each <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>'s simple behavior, which remains fixed for its whole "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>." &#160;</p>
<p>Individual <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s don't adapt, but <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> do. Competition has favored <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> that adapt to change, for example by adjusting their mix of digestive enzymes to suit the food available. Yet these mechanisms of adaptation are themselves fixed: food <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s trip genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es as cold air trips a thermostat. </p>
<p>&#160;Some <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> also use a primitive form of trial-and-error guidance. <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">Bacteria</a> of this sort tend to swim in straight lines, and have just enough "<a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>" to know whether conditions are improving or worsening as they go. If they <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that conditions are improving, they keep going straight. If they <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that conditions are getting worse, they stop, tumble, and head off in a random, generally different, direction. They test directions, and favor the good directions by discarding the bad. And because this makes them wander toward concentrations of food <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, they have prospered. </p>
<p>&#160;Flatworms lack brains, yet show the faculty of true <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. They can learn to choose the correct path in a simple T-maze. They try turning left and turning right, and gradually select the behavior - or form the habit - which produces the better result. This is selection of behavior by its consequences, which behaviorist psychologists call "the Law of Effect." The evolving genes of worm <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> have produced worm individuals with evolving behavior. </p>
<p>&#160;Still, worms trained to run mazes (even Skinner's pigeons, trained to peck when a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> flashes green) show no sign of the reflective <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> we associate with mind. Organisms adapting only though the simple Law of Effect learn only by trial and error, by varying and selecting actual behavior - they don't think ahead and decide. Yet natural selection often favored organisms that could think, and <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is not magical. As <a class="thought" href="entries/dennett_entry.html">Daniel Dennet</a>t of Tufts University points out, evolved genes can equip <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> brains with internal models of how the world works (somewhat like the models in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-aided <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s). The <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s can then "imagine" various <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s and consequences, avoiding <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s which "seem" dangerous and carrying out <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s which "seem" safe and profitable. By testing ideas against these internal models, they can save the effort and risk of testing <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s in the external world. </p>
<p>&#160;Dennett further points out that the Law of Effect can reshape the models themselves. As genes can provide for evolving behavior, so they can provide for evolving mental models. Flexible organisms can vary their models and pay more attention to the versions that prove better guides to <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. We all know what it is to try things, and learn which work. Models need not be <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>ive; they can evolve in the course of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Speechless <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, however, seldom pass on their new insights. These vanish with the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that first produced them, because learned mental models are not stamped into the genes. Yet even speechless <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s can imitate each other, giving rise to memes and cultures. A <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> monkey in Japan invented a way to use water to separate grain from sand; others quickly learned to do the same. In <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cultures, with their <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and pictures, valuable new models of how the world works can outlast their creators and spread worldwide. </p>
<p>&#160;On a still higher level, a mind (and "mind" is by now a fitting name) can hold evolving standards for judging whether the parts of a model - the ideas of a worldview - seem reliable enough to guide <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. The mind thus selects its own <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s, including its selection rules. The rules of judgment that filter the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> evolved in this way. </p>
<p>&#160;As behavior, models, and standards for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> evolve, so can goals. That which <i>brings</i> good, as judged by some more <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> standard, eventually begins to <i>seem</i> good; it then becomes a goal in itself. Honesty pays, and becomes a valued principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. As <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and mental models guide <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> and further <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, we adopt clear <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and accurate models as goals in themselves. Curiosity grows, and with it a <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> for its own sake. The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of goals thus brings forth both <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>. As <a class="thought" href="entries/darwin_entry.html">Charles Darwin</a> wrote, "the highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s." We achieve this as well by variation and selection, by concentrating on <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s of value and letting others slip from attention. </p>
<p>&#160;Marvin Minsky of the MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory views the mind as a sort of society, an evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of communicating, cooperating, competing agencies, each made up of yet simpler agents. He describes <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> in terms of the activity of these agencies. Some agencies can do little more than guide a hand to grasp a cup; others (vastly more elaborate) guide the speech <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> as it chooses words in a sticky situation. We aren't aware of directing our fingers to wrap around a cup <i>just so</i>. We delegate such tasks to competent agents and seldom notice unless they slip. We all feel conflicting impulses and speak unintended words; these are symptoms of discord among the agents of the mind. Our awareness of this is part of the self-regulating process by which our most general agencies manage the rest. </p>
<p>&#160;Memes may be seen as agents in the mind that are formed by teaching and imitation. To feel that two ideas conflict, you must have embodied both of them as agents in your mind - though one may be old, strong, and supported by allies, and the other a fresh idea-<a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> that may not survive its first battle. Because of our superficial self awareness, we often wonder where an idea in our heads came from. Some people imagine that these <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and feelings come directly from agencies outside their own minds; they incline toward a belief in haunted heads. </p>
<p>&#160;In ancient Rome, people believed in "genii," in good and evil <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>s attending a person from cradle to grave, bringing good and ill luck. They <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>d outstanding success to a special "<a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a>." And even now, people who fail to see how natural processes create novelty see "<a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a>" as a form of magic. But in fact, evolving genes have made minds that expand their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> by varying idea patterns and selecting among them. With quick variation and effective selection, guided by <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> borrowed from others, why shouldn't such minds show what we call <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a>? Seeing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> as a natural process makes the idea of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s less startling. It also suggests how they might work. </p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a></h1><p>One dictionary definition of "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>" is "Any <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, such as an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, that performs or assists in the performance of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> task." But just how many <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tasks will <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s be able to perform? Calculation was once a mental skill beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, the province of the intelligent and educated. Today, no one thinks of calling a pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>; calculation now seems a "merely" mechanical procedure. &#160;</p>
<p>Still, the idea of building ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s once was shocking. By the mid 1800s, though, <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a> had built mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s and part of a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>; however, he ran into difficulties of finance and construction. One Dr. Young helped not at all: he argued that it would be cheaper to invest the money and use the interest to pay <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s. Nor did the British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy - an entry in his diary states that "On September 15th Mr. Goulburn ... asked my opinion on the utility of Babbage's calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>... I replied, entering fully into the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, and giving my opinion that it was worthless." </p>
<p>&#160;Babbage's <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> was ahead of its <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> - meaning that in building it, machinists were forced to advance the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> of making precision parts. And in fact it would <i>not</i> have greatly exceeded the speed of a skilled <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> - but it would have been more reliable and easier to improve. </p>
<p>&#160;The story of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (known as <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) resembles that of flight in air and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Until recently people dismissed both ideas as impossible - commonly meaning that they couldn't see how to do them, or would be upset if they could. And so far, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> has had no simple, clinching demonstration, no equivalent of a working airplane or a landing on the Moon. It has come a long way, but people keep changing their definitions of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Press reports of "giant <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> brains" aside, few people called the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s intelligent. Indeed, the very name "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>" suggests a mere arithmetic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Yet in 1956, at Dartmouth, during the world's first conference on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers Alan Newell and Herbert Simon unveiled <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> Theorist, a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that proved theorems in symbolic <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>. In later years <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s were playing <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> and helping chemists determine molecular structures. Two medical <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, CASNET and <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> (the first dealing with internal <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, the other with the diagnosis and treatment of infections), have performed impressively. According to the <i>Handbook of</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>, they have been "rated, in experimental evaluations, as performing at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-expert levels in their respective domains." A <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/prospector_entry.html">PROSPECTOR</a> has located, in Washington state, a molybdenum deposit worth millions of dollars. &#160;</p>
<p>These so-called "<a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s" succeed only within strictly limited areas of competence, but they would have amazed the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers of the early 1950s. Today, however, few people consider them to be <i>real</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> has been a moving target. The passage from <i>Business Week</i> quoted earlier only shows that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can now be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med with enough <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and perform fancy enough tricks, that some people feel comfortable calling them intelligent. Years of seeing fictional robots and talking <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on television have at least made the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> familiar. </p>
<p>&#160;The chief <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for declaring <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> impossible has always been the notion that "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s" are intrinsically stupid, an idea that is now beginning to fade. Past <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have indeed been gross, clumsy things that did simple, brute-force work. But <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s handle <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, follow complex instructions, and can be instructed to change their own instructions. They can experiment and learn. They contain not gears and grease but traceries of wire and evanescent patterns of electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. As Douglas Hofstadter urges (through a character in a dialog about <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>), "Why don't you let the word '<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>' conjure up images of patterns of dancing <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> rather than of giant steam shovels?" </p>
<p>&#160;Cocktail-party critics confronted with the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> often point to the stupidity of present <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, as if this proved something about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. (A <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> may wonder whether such critics exhibited genuine <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>.) Their objection is irrelevant - steam locomotives didn't fly, though they demonstrated mechanical principles later used in airplane <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s. Likewise, the creeping worms of an eon ago showed no noticeable <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, yet our brains use <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s much like theirs. </p>
<p>&#160;Casual critics also avoid <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> seriously about <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> by declaring that we can't possibly build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s smarter than ourselves. They forget what <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> shows. Our distant, speechless ancestors managed to bring forth entities of greater <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> through genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> without even <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about it. But we <i>are</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about it, and the memes of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> evolve far more swiftly than the genes of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. We can surely make <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with a more <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like ability to learn and organize <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;There seems to be only one idea that could argue for the impossibility of making <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> patterns dance in new forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. This is the idea of <i>mental materialism</i> - the concept that mind is a special substance, a magical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>-stuff somehow beyond imitation, duplication, or technological use. </p>
<p>&#160;Psychobiologists see no evidence for such a substance, and find no need for mental materialism to explain the mind. Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> lies beyond the full grasp of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> understanding, it seems complex enough to embody a mind. Indeed, if a single person could <i>fully</i> understand a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, this would make the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> less complex than that person's mind. If all <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s billions of people could cooperate in simply watching the activity of one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, each person would have to monitor tens of thousands of active <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s simultaneously - clearly an impossible task. For a person to try to understand the flickering patterns of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> as a whole would be five billion times more absurd. Since our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s mechanism so massively overwhelms our mind's ability to grasp it, that mechanism seems complex enough to embody the mind itself. </p><h1>Turing's Target</h1><p>In a 1950 paper on <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, British mathematician <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> wrote: "I believe that by the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> without expecting to be contradicted." But this will depend on what we call <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Some say that only people can think, and that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s cannot be people; they then sit back and look smug. </p>
<p>&#160;But in his paper, Turing asked how we judge <i><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a></i> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and suggested that we commonly judge people by the quality of their conversation. He then proposed what he called the imitation game - which everyone else now calls the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. Imagine that you are in a room, able to communicate through a terminal with a person and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in two other rooms. You type messages; both the person and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can reply. Each tries to act <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and intelligent. After a prolonged keyboard "conversation" with them-perhaps touching on literature, <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, the weather, and how a mouth tastes in the morning - it might be that you could not tell which was the person and which the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. If a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could converse this well on a regular basis, then Turing suggests that we should consider it genuinely intelligent. Further, we would have to acknowledge that it knew a great deal about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. </p>
<p>&#160;For most practical purposes, we need not ask "Can a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> have <i>self</i>-awareness - that is, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>?" Indeed, critics who declare that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s cannot be conscious never seem able to say quite what they mean by the term. Self-awareness evolved to guide <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, not merely to ornament our humanity. We must be aware of other people, and of their abilities and inclinations, to make plans that involve them. Likewise we must be aware of ourselves, and of our own abilities and inclinations, to make plans about ourselves. There is no special mystery in self-awareness. What we call the self reacts to impressions from the rest of the mind, orchestrating some of its activities; this makes it no more (and no less) than a special part of the interacting patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. The idea that the self is a pattern in a special mind substance (distinct from the mind substance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>) would explain nothing about awareness. </p>
<p>&#160;A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> attempting to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> would, of course, claim to have self-awareness. Hard-core biochauvinists would simply say that it was lying or confused. So long as they refuse to say what they mean by <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, they can never be proved wrong. Nonetheless, whether called conscious or not, intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will still act intelligent, and it is their <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s that will affect us. Perhaps they will someday shame the biochauvinists into silence by impassioned argument, aided by a brilliant public-relations campaign. &#160;</p>
<p>No <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can now pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, and none is likely to do so soon. It seems wise to ask whether there is a good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> even to try: we may gain more from <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> guided by other goals. </p>
<p>&#160;Let us distinguish two sorts of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, though a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could show both kinds. The first is <i>technical</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, adapted to deal with the physical world. Efforts in this field lead toward automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and scientific inquiry. The second is <i>social</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, adapted to deal with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds. Efforts in this field lead toward <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s able to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Researchers working on social <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will learn much about the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind along the way, and their <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will doubtless have great practical value, since we all can profit from intelligent help and advice. But automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering based on technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will have a greater impact on the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race, including the race toward molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. And an advanced automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> may be easier to develop than a Turing-test passer, which must not only possess <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, but must mimic <i><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a></i> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <i><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a></i> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> - a special, more difficult challenge. </p>
<p>&#160;As Turing asked, "May not <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s carry out something which ought to be described as <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> but which is very different from what a man does?" Although some writers and politicians may refuse to recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> until they are confronted with a talkative <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> able to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, many <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in other forms. </p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s of Design</h1><p>We are well on the way to automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have marketed <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s that help people to deal with practical problems. <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>mers have created <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-aided design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that embody <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about shapes and motion, stress and strain, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, heat flow, and how <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools shape metal. Designers use these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to augment their mental models, speeding the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of yet unbuilt designs. Together, designers and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s form intelligent, semiartificial <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>&#160;Engineers can use a wide variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to aid their work. At one end of the spectrum, they use <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screens simply as drawing boards. Farther along, they use <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to describe parts in three dimensions and calculate their response to heat, stress, current, and so on. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s also know about <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-controlled manufacturing equipment, letting <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers make simulated tests of instructions that will later direct <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to make real parts. But the far end of the spectrum of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s involves using <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s not just to record and test designs, but to generate them. &#160;</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>mers have developed their most impressive tools for use in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> business itself. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> design is an example. <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated circuit</a> chips now contain many thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s and wires. Designers once had to work for many months to design a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> to do a given job, and to lay out its many parts across the surface of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>. Today they can often delegate this task to a so-called "<a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_compiler_entry.html">silicon compiler</a>." Given a specification of a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>'s function, these <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can produce a detailed design - ready for manufacture - with little or no <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> help. &#160;</p>
<p>All these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s rely entirely on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, laboriously gathered and coded. The most flexible automated design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s today can fiddle with a proposed design to seek improvements, but they learn nothing applicable to the <i>next</i> design. But <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> is different. Developed by Professor Douglas Lenat and others at Stanford University, <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> is designed to explore new areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. It is guided by <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s - pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that suggest plausible <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s to follow or implausible ones to avoid; in effect, various rules of thumb. It uses <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s to suggest topics to work on, and further <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s to suggest what approaches to try and how to judge the results. Other <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s look for patterns in results, propose new <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s, and rate the value of both new and old <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s. In this way <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> evolves better behaviors, better internal models, and better rules for selecting among internal models. Lenat himself describes the variation and selection of <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s and concepts in the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in terms of "mutation" and "selection," and suggests a social, cultural metaphor for understanding their interaction. </p>
<p>&#160;Since <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s evolve and compete in <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a>, it makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to expect parasites to appear - as indeed many have. One <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-generated <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>, for example, rose to the highest possible value rating by claiming to have been a co-discoverer of every valuable new conjecture. Professor Lenat has worked closely with <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a>, improving its mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> by giving it <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s for shedding parasites and avoiding stupid lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. </p>
<p>&#160;EURISKO has been used to explore <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, games, three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> design, oil spill cleanup, plumbing, and (of course) <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s. In some fields it has startled its designers with <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> ideas, including new <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s for the emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s. </p>
<p>&#160;The results of a tournament illustrate the power of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> team. Traveler TCS is a <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic naval war game, played in accordance with two hundred pages of rules specifying design, cost, and performance constraints for the fleet ("TCS" stands for "Trillion Credit Squadron"). Professor Lenat gave <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> these rules, a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of starting <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to simulate a battle between two fleets. He reports that "it then designed fleet after fleet, using the <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> as the 'natural selection' mechanism as it 'evolved' better and better fleet designs." The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> would run all night, designing, testing, and drawing lessons from the results. In the morning Lenat would cull the designs and help it along. He credits about 60 percent of the results to himself, and about 40 percent to <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Lenat and <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> entered the 1981 national Traveler TCS tournament with a strange-looking fleet. The other contestants laughed at it, then lost to it. The Lenat/<a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> fleet won every round, emerging as the national champion. As Lenat notes, "This win is made more significant by the fact that no one connected with the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> had ever played this game before the tournament, or seen it played, and there were no practice rounds." &#160;</p>
<p>In 1982 the competition sponsors changed the rules. Lenat and <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> entered a very different fleet. Other contestants again laughed at it, then lost. Lenat and <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> again won the national championship. &#160;</p>
<p>In 1983 the competition sponsors told Lenat that if he entered and won again, the competition would be canceled. Lenat bowed out. </p>
<p>&#160;EURISKO and other <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s show that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s need not be limited to boring, repetitive work if they are given the right sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming. They can explore possibilities and turn up <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> ideas that surprise their creators. <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> has shortcomings, yet it points the way to a style of partnership in which an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> expert both contribute <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> to a design process. </p>
<p>&#160;In coming years, similar <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will transform <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers will work in a creative partnership with their <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, using <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> derived from current <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-aided design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s for doing simulations, and using evolving, <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to suggest designs to simulate. The <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er will sit at a screen to type in goals for the design process and draw sketches of proposed designs. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will respond by refining the designs, testing them, and displaying proposed alternatives, with explanations, graphs, and diagrams. The <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er will then make further suggestions and changes, or respond with a new task, until an entire <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> has been designed and simulated. </p>
<p>&#160;As such automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s improve, they will do more and more of the work faster and faster. More and more often, the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er will simply propose goals and then sort among good solutions proposed by the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Less and less often will the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er have to select parts, materials, and <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s. Gradually <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will be able to propose more general goals and expect good solutions to appear as a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of course. Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> ran for hours evolving fleets with a Traveler TCS <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>, automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will someday work steadily to evolve passenger jets having maximum safety and economy - or to evolve <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> jets and missiles best able to control the skies. </p>
<p>&#160;Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> has invented <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will invent molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, aided by <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for molecular simulations. Such advances in automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering will magnify the design-ahead phenomenon described earlier. Thus automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering will not only speed the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough, it will increase the leap that follows. &#160;</p>
<p>Eventually <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be able to create bold new designs without <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> help. Will most people call such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s intelligent? It doesn't really <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. </p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> Race</h1><p>Companies and <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s worldwide support <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work because it promises commercial and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> advantages. The United States has many university <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> laboratories and a host of new companies with names like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> Corporation, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_machines_entry.html">Thinking Machines Corporation</a>, Teknowledge, and Cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s Incorporated. In October of 1981 the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry announced a ten-year, $850 million <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to develop advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. With this, Japanese <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers plan to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to perform a billion logical inferences per second. In the fall of 1984 the Moscow Academy of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> announced a similar, five-year, $ 100 million effort. In October of 1983 the U.S. Department of Defense announced a five-year, $600 million Strategic Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>; they seek <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s able to see, <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, understand speech, and help manage battles. As Paul Wallich reports in the IEEE <i>Spectrum</i>, "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a> is considered by most people to be a cornerstone of next-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; all the efforts in different countries accord it a prominent place in their list of goals." </p>
<p>&#160;Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will emerge step by step, and each step will pay off in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and increased ability. As with molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> (and many other technologies), attempts to stop advances in one city, county, or country will at most let others take the lead. A miraculous success in stopping visible <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work <i>everywhere</i> would at most delay it and, as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s grow cheaper, let it mature in secret, beyond public scrutiny. Only a world state of immense power and stability could truly stop <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> everywhere and forever - a "solution" of bloodcurdling danger, in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of past abuses of merely national power. Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> seems inevitable. If we hope to form a realistic view of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, we cannot ignore it. </p>
<p>&#160;In a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> will be the ultimate tool because it will help us build all possible tools. Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could maneuver people out of existence, or they could help us build a new and better world. Aggressors could use them for conquest, or foresighted defenders could use them to stabilize peace. They could even help us control <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> itself. The hand that rocks the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> cradle may well rule the world. </p>
<p>&#160;As with <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, we will need foresight and careful strategy to use this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> safely and well. The issues are complex and interwoven with everything from the details of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to employment and the economy to the philosophical basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> rights. The most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> issues, though, involve what <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> can do. </p><h1>Are We Smart Enough?</h1><p>Despite the example of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, critics may still argue that our limited <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> may somehow prevent us from <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming genuinely intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. This argument seems weak, amounting to little more than a claim that because the <i>critic</i> can't see how to succeed, no one else will ever do better. Still, few would deny that <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to equal <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> abilities will indeed require fresh insights into <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>. Though the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming path to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <i>seems</i> open, our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> does not justify the sort of solid confidence that <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers had (decades before <a class="thought" href="entries/sputnik_entry.html">Sputnik</a>) in being able to reach the Moon with rockets, or that we have today in being able to build <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s through <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> design. <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>ming genuine <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, though a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, will require new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. This places it beyond firm projection. </p>
<p>&#160;We need accurate foresight, though. People clinging to comforting doubts about <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> seem likely to suffer from radically flawed images of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Fortunately, automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering escapes some of the burden of biochauvinist prejudice. Most people are less upset by the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s designing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s than they are by the idea of true general-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Besides, automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering has been shown to work; what remains is to extend it. Still, if more general <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are likely to emerge, we would be foolish to omit them from our calculations. Is there a way to sidestep the question of our ability to design intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s? </p>
<p>&#160;In the 1950s, many <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers concentrated on simulating <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functions by simulating <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. But <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers working on <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s based on words and symbols made swifter <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, and the focus of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work shifted accordingly. Nonetheless, the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea of neural simulation remains sound, and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will make it more practical. What is more, this approach seems guaranteed to work because it requires no fundamental new insights into the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Eventually, neurobiologists will use <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>-sized molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to study the structure and function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> where need be. Although <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers may gain useful insights about the organization of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> from the resulting advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, neural simulation can succeed without such insights. <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">Compiler</a>s translate <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s from one <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to another without understanding how they work. Photocopiers transfer patterns of words without reading them. Likewise, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers will be able to copy the neural patterns of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> into another medium without understanding their higher-level organization. </p>
<p>&#160;After <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s work, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will be able to design and build <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s based on advanced nanoelectronics and nanomachines. These will interact like <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, but will work faster. <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">Neuron</a>s, though complex, do seem simple enough for a mind to understand and an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er to imitate. Indeed, neurobiologists have learned much about their structure and function, even without molecular-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to probe their workings. </p>
<p>&#160;With this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will be able to build fast, capable <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, even without understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and without clever <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming. They need only study the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s neural structure and join artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s to form the same functional pattern. If they make all the parts right - including the way they mesh to form the whole - then the whole, too, will be right. "Neural" activity will flow in the patterns we call <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, but faster, because all the parts will work faster. </p><h1>Accelerating the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Race</h1><p>Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s seem possible and inevitable, but what effect will they have? No one can answer this in full, but one effect of automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering is clear: it will speed our advance toward the limits of the possible. </p>
<p>&#160;To understand our prospects, we need some idea of how fast advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will think. Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have only a tiny fraction of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, yet they can already run <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s imitating significant aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior. They differ totally from the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> in their <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> style of operation, though, so direct physical comparison is almost useless. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does a huge number of things at once, but fairly slowly; most modern <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s do only one thing at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but with blinding speed. </p>
<p>&#160;Still, one can imagine <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> built to imitate a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> not only in function, but in structure. This might result from a neural-simulation approach, or from the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s to run on <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> with a brainlike style of organization. Either way, we can use <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ies with the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to estimate a <i>minimum</i> speed for advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>-built <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>Neural <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s respond to signals in thousandths of a second; experimental <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es respond a hundred million times faster (and nanoelectronic <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es will be faster yet). Neural signals travel at under one hundred meters per second; <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> signals travel a million times faster. This crude comparison of speeds suggests that brainlike <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will work about a million times faster than brains made of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (at a rate limited by the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> signals). </p>
<p>&#160;This estimate <i>is</i> crude, of course. A neural <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> is more complex than a <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>; it can change its response to signals by changing its structure. Over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s even form and disappear. These changes in the fibers and connections of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> embody the long term mental changes we call <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. They have stirred Professor Robert Jastrow of Dartmouth to describe the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> as an enchanted loom, weaving and reweaving its neural patterns throughout <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;To imagine a brainlike <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> with comparable flexibility, picture its <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s as surrounded by mechanical nanocomputers and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, with one per <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>-equivalent "<a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>." Just as the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of a <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> responds to patterns of neural activity by modifying the <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>'s structure, so the nanocomputers will respond to patterns of activity by directing the nanomachinery to modify the <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>'s structure. With the right <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming, and with <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> among the nanocomputers to simulate chemical signals, such a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> should behave almost exactly like a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Despite its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> will be compact. Nanocomputers will be smaller than <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>-built wires will be thinner than the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s axons and dendrites. Thin wires and small <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es will make for compact <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and compact <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s will speed the flow of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> patterns by shortening the distances signals must travel. It seems that a structure similar to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will fit in less than a cubic centimeter (as discussed in the Notes). Shorter signal paths will then join with faster transmission to yield a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> over ten million times faster than a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Only cooling problems might limit such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to slower average speeds. Imagine a conservative design, a millionfold faster than a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and dissipating a millionfold more heat. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> consists of an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>-built block of sapphire the size of a coffee mug, honeycombed with <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>-lined cooling channels. A high-pressure water pipe of equal diameter is bolted to its top, forcing cooling water through the channels to a similar drainpipe leaving the bottom. Hefty power cables and bundles of optical-fiber <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> channels trail from its sides. </p>
<p>&#160;The cables supply fifteen megawatts of electric power. The drainpipe carries the resulting heat away in a three-ton-per-minute flow of boiling-hot water. The optical fiber bundles carry as much <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> as a million television channels. They bear <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s with other <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, with <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>s, and with <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that build designs for final testing. Every ten seconds, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> gobbles almost two kilowatt-days of electric <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> (now worth about a dollar). Every ten seconds, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> completes as much design work as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er working eight hours a day for a year (now worth tens of thousands of dollars). In an hour, it completes the work of centuries. For all its activity, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> works in a silence broken only by the rush of cooling water. </p>
<p>&#160;This addresses the question of the sheer speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, but what of its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>? <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> development seems unlikely to pause at the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind. As <a class="thought" href="entries/mccarthy_entry.html">John McCarthy</a> of Stanford's <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> lab points out, if we can place the equivalent of one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind in a metal skull, we can place the equivalent of ten thousand cooperating minds in a building. (And a large modern power plant could supply power enough for each to think at least ten thousand times as fast as a person.) To the idea of fast <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s, add the idea of fast <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering teams. </p>
<p>&#160;Engineering <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be slowed in their work by the need to perform experiments, but not so much as one might expect. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers today must perform many experiments because bulk <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is unruly. Who can say in advance exactly how a new alloy will behave when forged and then bent ten million times? Tiny cracks weaken metal, but details of processing determine their <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> and effects. </p>
<p>&#160;Because <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will make objects to precise specifications, the unpredictabilities of bulk <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be avoided. Designers (whether <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) will then experiment only when experimentation is faster or cheaper than calculation, or (more rarely) when <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is lacking. </p>
<p>&#160;AI <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to nanomachines will perform many experiments rapidly. They will design apparatus in seconds, and replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will build it without the many delays (ordering special parts, shipping them, and so on) that plague projects today. Experimental apparatus on the scale of an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>, nanocomputer, or living <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> will take only minutes to build, and nanomanipulators will perform a million motions per second. Running a million ordinary experiments at once will be easy. Thus, despite delays for experimentation, automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will move <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forward with stunning speed. </p>
<p>&#160;From past to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, then, the likely pattern of advancing ability looks something like this. Across eons of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> moved forward in a long, slow advance, paced by genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Minds with <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> picked up the pace, accelerated by the flexibility of memes. The <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> further accelerated advances by forcing memes to evolve faster. Growing wealth, <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, and population - and better physical and intellectual tools - have continued this accelerating trend across our century. </p>
<p>&#160;The automation of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering will speed the pace still more. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>-aided design will improve, helping <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to generate and test ideas ever more quickly. Successors to <a class="thought" href="entries/eurisko_entry.html">EURISKO</a> will shrink design times by suggesting designs and filling in the details of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> innovations. At some point, full-fledged automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will pull ahead on their own. </p>
<p>&#160;In parallel, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will develop and mature, aided by advances in automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Then <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>-built <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will bring still swifter automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, evolving technological ideas at a pace <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s a million times faster than a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The rate of technological advance will then quicken to a great upward leap: in a brief <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, many areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will advance to the limits <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> by natural law. In those fields, advance will then halt on a lofty plateau of achievement. </p>
<p>&#160;This transformation is a dizzying prospect. Beyond it, if we survive, lies a world with replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, able to make whatever they are told to make, without need for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> labor. Beyond it, if we survive, lies a world with automated <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to direct <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s to make <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s near the limits of the possible, near the final limits of technical perfection. </p>
<p>&#160;Eventually, some <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will have both great technical ability and the social ability needed to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> speech and wishes. If given charge of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, materials, and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> might aptly be called a "genie <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>." What you ask for, it will produce, Arabian legend and universal <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> suggest that we take the dangers of such <a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">engines of creation</a> very seriously indeed. </p>
<p>&#160;Decisive breakthroughs in technical and social <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will be years in arriving. As <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> has said, "The modestly intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> promise only to bring us the wealth and comfort of tireless, obedient, and inexpensive servants." Most <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s now called "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>" do not think or learn; they are only a crude distillate of the skills of experts, preserved, packaged, and distributed for consultation. </p>
<p>&#160;But genuine <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will arrive. To leave it out of our expectations would be to live in a fantasy world. To expect <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is neither optimistic nor pessimistic: as always, the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er's <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> is the technophobe's pessimism. If we do not prepare for their arrival, social <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could pose a grave threat: consider the damage done by the merely <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of terrorists and demagogues. Likewise, technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could destabilize the world <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> balance, giving one side a sudden, massive lead. With proper preparation, however, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> could help us build a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> that works - for the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, for people, and for the advancement of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Chapter 12 will suggest an approach, as part of the more general issue of managing the transformation that <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will bring. </p>
<p>&#160;Why discuss the dangers today? Because it is not too soon to start developing institutions able to deal with such questions. Technical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is emerging today, and its every advance will speed the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a> is but one of many powerful technologies we must learn to manage, each adding to a complex mixture of threats and opportunities.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think robotoys will lead the way to very useful and complex robots.  They are the first step toward cars and other machines that think for themselves about the jobs they are designed to do.  Robotoys are designed to be cute.  But expect to someday see house cleaners that vacuum and dust and maybe even wash and wax the car.  Fruit-picking trucks will drive through orchards picking apples as they go and boxing them for shipment to the supermarket as they do.  Cars will take the information from sattelites to keep track of where you are and deliver you to where you want to go with just a name and address as instructions.  If they break down, they will automatically call for help and drive themselves home after they've been fixed.  But that won't happen often because, like people, they'll be able to feel trouble coming and take themselves to the robodoctor before the problem has a chance to leave you stranded.  Safety and convenience will take over the market as reasons for their existence and cute will be the substance of fads and tie-ins to movies and computer games.  
<br>
<br>
That's the world of robots as I see it in the next 20 or 30 years.  A military man, of course, will see robot soldiers and mighty machines that can hunt down people or kill other robots.  They will want tiny robots that can creep into our houses and watch what we do in order to stop us if we plan rebellion.  And cameras as small as a speck of dust will float on the wind and track the weather as well as the people it washes over.  I hope by that time we'll no longer need a military.  Or even a police force.  If society has an immediate reaction time and can see everything the individual is doing, perhaps the individual will stop being antisocial and maladjusted.  The nanobots inside us will be able to spot behavioral problems before they arise and help will come sliding down the web to fix them before we reach a stage we call antisocial.
<br>
<br>
The brave new world of the future holds a lot of promise as well as a strange marriage between man and machine.  It's a given that many will love and enjoy it and maybe just as many will fear and hate it.  But with our enhanced intelligence and single-minded viewpoint, maybe we'll be able to banish hate and fear to live in a world that only wants to make life better for us.
<br>
<br>
The question will be: who decides what's better for us?  Man or machine?  Or both?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think that some sort of AI is possible in the near term. The way to achieve it is with cooperation. Right now one group is working on how to move an arm. One group is working on how to play chess. One group is working on how to walk. One group is working on how to translate languages. If all these groups had a common interface that could be connected together through a program such as EURISKO, then an AI could be generated. I am assuming that we realize that the list of skillsets do not have to be limited by the ones mentioned above.
<br>
<br>
The resulting maching would be hugh connecting hundreds or thousands of machines together. Remember the ENIAC was a huge machine which got smaller over the decades.
<br>
<br>
EURISKO would have to learn to accept all the inputs from the various machines on the AI net and process the input and direct the outputs to the appropiate machines, not necessarily the ones to input the information. This program will at first be limited in what it could do. As time went on and as more machines joined the AI net, The limitations would slowly dissapear.
<br>
<br>
This should be a national chalange, similar as going back to the moon. The rewards of this could be much more important to the health of this country and could help the many technologists who are out of work.</p></td>

A human brain is specialised to

a) work in the interactive environment.
<br>
<br>
b) work mainly by intercoperation with other humans: this last may see unlikely but then why is so much of our brain devoted to signaling and language and interpretation of language?

The following is my point of view on the possible ways for use the new, invented by me, class of devices as control unit. That approach to developing artificial reasonable subjective devices is representing the revolutionary step forward from the conventional computers.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Introduction
<br>
<br>
In our opinion in order to fulfill the requirements to the system capable of understanding what it is doing the new class of devices should be developed.
<br>
 That class of devices will differ from all the currently known devices in the computer field, because they will be subjective.  Subjective nature could bring to that class of devices the ability to learn instead of to be programmed. That, in turn, raises the question of how to motivate them to perform the tasks which are necessary for the owner. It is known that at MIT, for example, researchers are developing the basic principles of building the robotic society where members of it could be motivated by programmed analog for human moral rules.    
<br>
	We could propose the different way of motivation. Projected systems could be motivated according to desire of the motivator. 
<br>
<br>
The Basic concepts
<br>
<br>
In our opinion, there is no reason to attempt to develop the 'Consciousness' system. 
<br>
The theories of "Consciousness" have described its properties by explaining the behavior of the system. Every known explanation of its properties actually is a description of some act of the behavior 1 of the "conscious" system.  We believe that it is possible to develop the subjective systems which will behave in reasonable way. However, the problem is not only in the designated terms. Our opinion is that the concept of "Consciousness", in a technical sense, isn't a valid one.  It is a thought up, nonexistent phenomenon. The theories are attributing the various properties to "Consciousness", but it is not proven that it is possible to define it in a scientifically consistent way. 
<br>
 Assumption that 'Consciousness' is really existing phenomenon, inevitably leads to necessity, to place the central managing body inside of the brain, but that is in contradiction with the known facts.   
<br>
	Nevertheless, attempts to create and study 'Consciousness' systems still continue. 
<br>
The last, known to me attempt to design the elements of a 'Consciousness' systems was based on micro-tubular structure theory proposed by professors Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff.  
<br>
 As a result of that study, according to the authors of the theory, connections between a micro-tubular structure and 'Consciousness' has not been established. 
<br>
The term 'Reason' instead of the controversial terms 'Cognitive', 'Consciousness' or "Artificial Intelligence" makes more sense for a description of the subject. 
<br>
<br>
One can judge about the abilities of the system to be reasonable only by the phenomenon of its observable behavior. The hierarchy of subjective models which reflect its past experience determines the behavior of the system. The control system aspires to receive the greatest positive reaction on the part of itself, and other reasonable systems, if it is a member of the society, by establishing the models of behavior (1). 
<br>
<br>
The summary of the above is:
<br>
<br>
	"The system is reasonable, if it is capable to determine its own behavior, be guided by its own, subjective representation about the World known to it." 
<br>
<br>
There is no rationality without subjectivity!
<br>
<br>
In opposition to V.I. Lenin statements that 'The world is given to us through senses' it is possible to state: The World is given to us by our own subjective representation about it!
<br>
<br>
Unique possible link between subjective representations about the real world and the real world are subjective representations about practice of interaction with it.
<br>
There where such interaction is impossible subjective representations didn't have any limitations.
<br>
<br>
I new that creation of the reasonable systems could be directed by these ideas. The reasonable system can't be guided directly by any finite set of programs. Almost all that is necessary for the development of the discussed system could be derived from these statements.
<br>
<br>
(1. the term 'behavior' is describes all that is happening with the system under influence of its own internal causes. For example, speech, mind, perceiving, feeling at all. are kinds of behavior.
<br>
That is solution of many problems in philosophy concerning relations between a material body and both non-material ideas and representations.
<br>
