<div class="TeaserText">Ray Kurzweil was invited to participate in the 2001 Fortune Magazine conference in Aspen, Colorado, which featured luminaries and leaders from the worlds of technology, entertainment and commerce. Here are his responses to questions addressed at the conference.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally written July 2001 to be presented August 2001. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 11, 2001.</p>

<i>Once upon a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we committed ourselves to putting a man on the moon. What kind of similar commitment should we make now? What's the "moon shot" of the 21st century?</i>
</p>
<p>Create <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that combines the strengths of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and implement it in both our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and in ourselves.</p>
<p>We <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humans excel in our powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> as well as our <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Our ability to recognize and respond appropriately to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> reflects the most complex and subtle thing we do. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> also has <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> advantages, for example the ability to instantly share <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, speed (<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s is already 10 million times faster than our interneuronal connections) and capacity.</p>
<p>Today, our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is restricted to a mere 100 trillion connections in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Although the capacity of our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s today is still millions of times less powerful than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> of our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is fixed whereas the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is expanding exponentially. The cross-over point is only decades away.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is not hidden from us. We are also making exponential gains in scanning, modeling, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which will be the ultimate source for the "methods" of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>We will ultimately have the opportunity to combine the rich, diverse, and flexible powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> sharing, speed, and capacity of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. What form will this take? The answer is many different forms. One mode will be fully <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like qualities. The more interesting prospect will be expanding our own <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> through intimate connection with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>This undertaking will be the result of the ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, the continuing shrinking of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, as well as our accelerating understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and neural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. This should not be a <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>-style <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> project, but rather should reflect the ongoing interplay of private enterprise with a panoply of academic and <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> institutions.</p>
<p>
<i>As the world heads down its current path, what should we fear most?</i>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> amplifies both our creative and destructive <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>s. Our lives are immeasurably better off today than 100 years ago, but the twentieth century has also witnessed great amplification of our means for destruction.</p>
<p>Most powerful and potentially pernicious is <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>. We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> in the medium of nuclear processes, and we are on the threshold of widely available means for creating bioengineered <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s. In a couple of decades, we'll also have the ability to create self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities in which key features are measured in nanometers. Following that will be the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> smart enough to invent its own next generation suggesting a run away phenomenon not clearly under the control of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humanity. Twenty-first century technologies will be billions of times more powerful than those of the twentieth century, and there are a myriad of downside scenarios that we can already envisage.</p>
<p>Calls for relinquishing potentially dangerous technologies such as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is not the answer. For one thing, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is not a unified field, but rather the inevitable end result of a broad trend toward <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> that pervades most areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. We could scarcely stop the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> without "relinquishing" virtually all <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> development. Moreover, the dangerous technologies represent the same <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as the beneficial ones. For example, the same biotechnologies that will save millions of lives from <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and other diseases in the years ahead is precisely the same know-how that can potentially empower a terrorist to create a new <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>.</p>
<p>Although I believe the risks are real, I believe that maintaining a free and open society is our best route to developing effective countermeasures. Serious attempts to relinquish broad areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> will only drive them underground where the less responsible practitioners (i.e., the terrorists) will have all the expertise.</p>
<p>
<i>What issue or issues will most define our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>?</i>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Who or what is <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>.</b> The <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies (<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, varied biotechnologies, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>) combined with the exponential shrinking of the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will blur the line between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>How can we avoid grave new dangers of </b><b><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></b><b> while reaping profound benefits.</b> Most observers use linear extrapolation for their estimates of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-frames, but this ignores the exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. We're currently doubling the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rate every decade. This will raise the issue of how can we reliably anticipate the impact of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to emphasize the promise while we avoid the peril.</li>
<li>
<b>How do we reinvent social institutions when people rarely die.</b> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span is also growing exponentially through multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> revolutions (<a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">Genomics</a>, Proteomics, therapeutic cloning, rational drug design, and others), to be followed a couple of decades hence by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. Within ten years, we'll be adding more than a year every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy. Many issues will be raised as all of our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> traditions need to be rethought.</li>
