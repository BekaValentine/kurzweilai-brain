<div class="TeaserText">Uploading doesn't necessarily mean consciousness on a chip. What if you could be anything: a lion or an antelope, a frog or a fly, a tree, a pool, the coat of paint on a ceiling? Nanotechnology may pave the way.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published 1994 in <a class="thought" href="entries/extropy_entry.html">Extropy</a> magazine. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 6, 2001.</p>
<p>Less poetically, consider the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that can support <a class="thought" href="entries/uploading_entry.html">uploading</a>: enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power; the ability to build billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s; structures smaller and/or more powerful than those of our existing bodies.</p>
<p>In a pinch, i.e. if I were going to die otherwise, I'd upload onto just about any working <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>. But absent that, I'd want some advantage to induce me to take that somewhat hazardous step.</p>
<p>If a whole community of people uploads, they can live together in an almost limitlessly rich and varied, shared virtual environment. Indeed, physical humans can participate in such an environment with VR equipment, at least to the extent that the phenomena of the environment are translatable to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> senses. But for the upload to participate in the real physical environment, it needs a robotic body to <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> and affect its surroundings.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, when you get right down to it, is a pretty nifty gadget. It has some maddening limitations, most of which are due to its essential <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> as a bag of seawater. It wouldn't be too hard, given <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, to design a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body that was stronger, lighter, with a faster <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and less limited senses, able to operate comfortably in any natural environment on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> or in outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>  (excluding the Sun and a few other obvious places). But these would be basically extensions in degree, not kind, to the existing design.</p>
<p>In the virtual environment of the uploads, not only can the environment be anything you like; you can be anything you like. You can be big or small; you can be lighter than air, and fly; you can teleport and walk through walls. You can be a lion or an antelope, a frog or a fly, a tree, a pool, the coat of paint on a ceiling.</p>
<p>You can be these things in the real world, too, if your body is made of Utility Fog. Utility Fog is an intelligent substance, able to simulate the physical properties of most common substances, and having enough processing power that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level processes could run in a handful or so of it.</p>
<p>Imagine a microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>.</p>
<p>It has a body about the size of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and 12 arms sticking out in all directions. A bucketful of such robots might form a ``robot crystal'' by linking their arms up into a lattice structure. Now take a room, with people, furniture, and other objects in it--it's still mostly empty air. Fill the air completely full of robots. The robots are called <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s and the substance they form is Utility Fog.</p>
<p>With the right <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming, the robots can exert any force in any direction on the surface of any object. They can support the object, so that it apparently floats in the air. They can support a person, applying the same pressures to the seat of the pants that a chair would. They can exert the same resisting forces that elbows and fingertips would receive from the arms and back of the chair. A <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> running in the Utility Fog can thus simulate the physical existence of an object.</p>
<p>The Utility Fog operates in two modes: First, the ``naive'' mode where the robots act much like cells, and each <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> occupies a particular position and does a particular function in a given object. The second, or ``Fog'' mode, has the robots acting more like the pixels on a TV screen. The object is then formed of a pattern of robots, which vary their properties according to which part of the object they are representing at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. An object can then move across a cloud of robots without the individual robots moving, just as the pixels on a CRT remain stationary while pictures move around on the screen.</p>
<p>The Utility Fog which is simulating air needs to be impalpable. One would like to be able to walk through a Fog-filled room without the feeling of having been cast into a block of solid Lucite. Of course if one is a Fog-mode upload this is straightforward; but the whole point of having Fog instead of a purely <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> is to mix virtual and physical objects in a seamless way. To this end, the robots representing empty <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> can run a fluid-flow simulation of what the air would be doing if the robots weren't there. Then each <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> moves where the air it displaces would move in its absence.</p>
<p>How can (physical) people breathe when the air is a solid mass of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s? Actually, it isn't really solid: the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s only occupy about 10% of the actual volume of the air (they need lots of ``elbow room'' to move around easily). There's plenty of air left to breathe. As far as physically breathing it, we <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a pressure-sensitive boundary which translates air motions on one side to Fog motions on the other.</p>
<p>The other major functions the air performs, that humans notice, are transmitting sound and <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. Both of these properties are obscured by the presence of Fog in the air, but both can be simulated at a level sufficient to fool the senses of humans and most <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s by transmitting the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> through the Fog by means we'll consider later, and reconstructing the physical.</p>
<p>To understand why we want to fill the air with microscopic robots only to go to so much trouble to make it seem as if they weren't there, consider the advantages of a TV or <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen over an ordinary picture. Objects on the screen can appear and disappear at will; they are not constrained by the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. The whole scene can shift instantly from one apparent locale to another. Completely imaginary constructions, not possible to build in physical reality, could be commonplace. Virtually anything imaginable could be given tangible reality in a Utility Fog environment.</p>
<p>Why not, instead, build a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that produces a purely sensory (but indistinguishable) version of the same apparent world? The Fog acts as a continuous bridge between actual physical reality and <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. The Fog is universal effector as well as a universal sensor. Any (real) object in the Fog environment can be manipulated with an extremely wide array of patterns of pressure, force, and support; measured; analyzed; weighed; cut; reassembled; or reduced to <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>-sized pieces and sorted for recycling.</p><h1>General Properties and Uses</h1><p>As well as forming an extension of the senses and muscles of individual people, the Fog can act as a generalized infrastructure for society at large. Fog City need have no permanent buildings of concrete, no roads of asphalt, no cars, trucks, or busses. It can look like a park, or a forest, or if the population is sufficiently whimsical, ancient Rome one day and Emerald City the next.</p>
<p>It will be more efficient to build dedicated <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s for long distance <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> propagation, and physical transport. For local use, and <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> to the worldwide <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, the Fog is ideal for all of these functions. It can act as shelter, clothing, telephone, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and automobile. It will be almost any common household object, appearing from nowhere when needed  (and disappearing afterwards). It gains a certain efficiency from this extreme of polymorphism; consider the number of hardcopy photographs necessary to store all the images one sees on a television or <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen. With Utility Fog we can have one ``display'' and keep all our physical possesions on disk.</p>
<p>Another item of infrastructure that will become increasingly important in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will allow us to build some really monster <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Although each <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> will possess a comparatively small processor--which is to say the power of a current-day <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>--there are about 16 million <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s to a cubic inch. When those <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s are not doing anything else, i.e. when they are simulating the interior of a solid object or air that nothing is passing through at the moment, they can be used as a computing resource (with the caveats below).</p><h1>The Limits of Utility Fog Capability</h1><p>When discussing something as far outside of everyday experience as the Utility Fog, it is a good idea to delineate both sides of the boundary. The Fog is capable of so many literally amazing things, we will point out a few of the things it isn't capable of:</p>
<p>--Anything requiring hard metal (cold steel?). For example, Fog couldn't simulate a drill <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> cutting through hardwood. It would be able to cut the hole, but the process would be better described as intelligent sandpaper.</p>
<p>--Anything requiring both high strength and low volume. A parachute could not be made of Fog (unless, of course, all the air were filled with Fog, in which case one could simply fly).</p>
<p>--Anything requiring high heat. A Fog fire blazing merrily away on Fog logs in a fireplace would feel warm on the skin a few feet away; it would feel the same to a hand inserted into the ``flame''.</p>
<p>--Anything requiring molecular manipulation or chemical transformation. <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s are simply on the wrong scale to play with atoms. In particular, they cannot reproduce themselves. On the other hand, they can do things like prepare food the same way a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cook does--by mixing, stirring, and using special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that were designed for them to use.</p>
<p>--Fog cannot simulate food, or anything else that is destined to be broken down chemically. Eating it would be like eating the same amount of sand or sawdust.</p>
<p>--Fog can simulate air to the touch but not to the eyes. The best indications are that it would look like heavy fog. Thus the Fog would need to support a pair of holographic goggles in front of the eyes of an embedded user. Such goggles are clearly within the capabilities of the same level of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> as is needed for the Fog, but are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><h1>Other Desirable Limitations</h1><p>In 1611, William Shakespeare wrote his final play, ``The Tempest.'' 445 years later, an obscure <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> writer named W. J. Stuart updated the Tempest's plot into a story called ``Forbidden <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">Planet</a>,'' and created a modern myth.</p>
<p>Forbidden <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">Planet</a>, more precisely the movie version, has become the classic cautionary tale for any scenario in which people become too powerful and control their environment too easily. In the story, the Krell are an ancient, wise, and highly advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. They perfect an enormous and powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, capable of projecting objects and forces anywhere in any form, upon the mental commands of any Krell. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> works ``not wisely but too well,'' manifesting all the deeply buried subconscious desires of the Krell to destroy each other.</p>
<p>Utility Fog will provide humans with powers that approximate those of the fictional Krell <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Luckily, we have centuries of literary tradition to guide us around the pitfalls of hubris made reality. We must study this tradition, or we may be doomed to repeat it--a truth that is by no means limited to the Utility Fog, or indeed to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in general.</p>
<p>The first thing we can do is to require fully conscious, unequivocal commands for the Fog to take any <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Beyond that, we can try to suggest some of the protocols that may be useful in managing the Fog in a situation where humans are interacting in close physical proximity. Even if we have solved the problem of translating one's individual wishes, however expressed, into the quadrillions of sets of instructions to individual <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s to accomplish what one desired, the problem of who gets to control which <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s is probably a much more <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious one.</p>
<p>We can physicalize the psychological concept of ``personal <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>''. The <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s within some distance of each person would be under that person's exclusive control; personal spaces could not merge except by mutual consent. This single protocol could prevent most crimes of violence in our hypothetical Fog City.</p>
<p>A corollary point is that physically perpetrated theft would be impossible in a Fog world. It would still be possible by <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>al means, i.e. fraud, hacking, etc; but the Fog could be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to put ownership on the level of a physical law.--Not that it really makes any <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to think of stealing a fog-mode object, anyway. Ownership and control of the Fog need not be any more complex than the bundles of rights currently associated with everything from land to <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> stock.</p>
<p>Indeed, much of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming of the Fog will need to have the character of physical laws. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> for the enormous potential <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> to be comprehensible and thus usable to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, it needs to be organized by simple but powerful principles, which must be consonant with the huge amount of hard-<a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing our sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s perform. For example, it would be easy to move furniture (or buildings) by manipulating an appropriately sized scale model, and easy to observe the effects by watching the model. However, the Fog could just as easily have flooded the room with 100 kHz sound, and frequency-scaled the echoes down into the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> auditory range. A bat would have no trouble with this kind of ``scale model'', but to humans it's just <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>.</p>
<p>It will be necessary, in general, to arrange the overall control of the Fog to be extremely distributed, as local as possible, robust in the presence of failure. When we realize that a single cubic inch of Fog represents a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of 16 million processors, the concept of hierarchical control with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> oversight can be seen to be hopelessly inadequate. Agoric distributed control <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s offer one possible solution.</p><h1>Advantages of a Utility Fog Environment</h1><p>Another major advantage for <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>-filling Fog is safety. In a car (or its <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> descendant) Fog forms a dynamic form-fitting cushion that protects better than any seatbelt of nylon fibers. An appropriately built house filled with Fog could even protect its inhabitants from the (physical) effects of a nuclear weapon within 95% or so of its lethal blast area.</p>
<p>There are many more mundane ways the Fog can protect its occupants, not the least being physically to remove <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, mites, pollen, and so forth, from the air. A Fog-filled home would no longer be the place that most accidents happen. First, by performing most household tasks using Fog as an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ality, the cuts and falls that accompany the use of knives, power tools, ladders, and so forth, can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Secondly, the other major class of household accidents, young children who injure themselves out of ignorance, can be avoided by a number of means. A child who climbed over a stair rail would float harmlessly to the floor. A child could not pull a bookcase over on itself; falling over would not be among the bookcase's repertoire. Power tools, kitchen implements, and cleaning chemicals would not normally exist; they or their <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>s would be called into existence when needed and vanish instead of having to be cleaned and put away. Outside the home, the possibilities are, if anything, greater. One can easily imagine ``industrial Fog'' which forms a factory. It would consist of larger robots. Unlike domestic Fog, which would have the density and strength of balsa wood, industrial Fog could have bulk properties resembling hardwood or aluminum. A <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>- age factory would probably consist of a mass of Fog with special-purpose reactors embedded in it, where high-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> chemical transformations could take place. All the physical manipulation, transport, assembly, and so forth would be done by the Fog.</p><h1>Applications in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Exploration</h1><p>The major <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of spaceships will need to be made with special- purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological mechanisms, and indeed with such mechanisms pushed much closer to their true capacities than anything we have talked about heretofore. In the spaceship's cabin, however, will be an acceleration couch. When not accelerating, which is most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we'd prefer something useful, like empty <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, there. The Utility Fog makes a better acceleration couch, anyway.</p>
<p>Fill the cabin with Utility Fog and never worry about floating out of reach of a handhold. <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">Instrument</a>s, consoles, and cabinets for equipment and supplies are not needed. Non-simulable items can be embedded in the fog in what are apparently bulkheads. The Fog can add great structural strength to the ship itself; the rest of the structure need be not much more than a balloon.</p>
<p>The same is true for spacesuits: Fog inside the suit manages the air pressure and makes motion easy; Fog outside gives extremely fine manipulating ability for various tasks. Of course, like the ship, the suit contains many special purpose non-Fog mechanisms.</p>
<p>Surround the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> station with Fog. It needs radiation shielding anyway (if the occupants are long-term); use big industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s with lots of redundancy in the mechanism; even so they may get recycled fairly often. All the stock problems from SF movies go away: humans never need go outside merely to fix something; when EVA is desired for transfer or recreation, outside Fog provides complete safety and motion control. It also makes a good tugboat for docking spaceships.</p>
<p>Homesteaders on the Moon could bring along a batch of heavy duty Fog as well as the special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> power generation and waste recycling equipment. There will be a million and one things, of the ordinary yet arduous physical task kind, that must be done to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up and maintain a self- sufficient household.</p><h1>Physical Properties of Utility Fog</h1><p>Most currently proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological designs are based on <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">Carbon</a> is a marvelous <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> for structural purposes, forming a crystal (diamond) which is very stiff and strong. However, a Fog built of diamond would have a problem which nanomechanical designs of a more conventional form do not pose: the Fog has so much surface area exposed to the air that if it were largely diamond, especially on the surface, it would amount to a ``fuel-air explosive''. Therefore the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> is designed so that its structural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, forming the major <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of its mass, are made of aluminum oxide, a refractory compound using common <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. The structural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s form an exoskeleton, which besides being a good mechanical design allows us to have an evacuated interior in which more sensitive nanomechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s can operate. Of course, any macroscopic ignition source would vaporize the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>; but as long as more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is used vaporizing the exoskeleton than is gained burning the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s inside, the reaction cannot spread.</p>
<p>Each <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> has twelve arms, arranged as the faces of a dodecahedron. The arms telescope rather than having joints. The arms swivel on a universal joint at the base, and the gripper at the end can rotate about the arm's axis. Each arm thus has four degrees of freedom, plus opening and closing the gripper. The only load-carrying motor on each axis is the extension/retraction motor. The swivel and rotate axes are weakly driven, able to position the arm in free air but not drive any kind of load; however, there are load-holding brakes on these axes.</p>
<p>The gripper is a hexagonal structure with three fingers, mounted on alternating faces of the hexagon. Two <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s ``grasp hands'' in an interleaved six-finger grip. Since the fingers are designed to match the end of the other arm, this provides a relatively rigid connection; forces are only transmitted axially through the grip. When at rest, the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s form a regular lattice structure. If the bodies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as atoms, it is a ``face-centered cubic'' crystal formation, where each <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> touches 12 other atoms.</p>
<p>Consider the arms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s as the girders of the trusswork of a bridge: they form the <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> known as the ``octet truss'' invented by Buckminster Fuller in 1956. The spaces bounded by the arms form alternate tetrahedrons and octahedrons, both of which are rigid shapes.</p>
<p>The Fog may be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as consisting of layers of <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s. The layers, and the shear planes they define, lie at 4 major angles  (corresponding to the faces of the tetrahedrons and octahedrons) and 3 minor ones (corresponding to the face-centered cube faces). In each of the 4 major orientations, each <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> uses six arms to hold its neighbors in the layer; layers are thus a 2-dimensionally rigid fabric of equilateral triangles. In face-centered mode, the layers work out to be square grids, and are thus not rigid, a slight disadvantage. Most Fog motion is organized in layers; layers slide by passing each other down hand-over-hand in bucket brigade fashion. At any instant, roughly half the arms will be linked between layers when they are in motion.</p>
<p>The Fog moves an object by setting up a seed-shaped zone around it. The <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s in the zone move with the object, forming a fairing which makes the motions around it smoother. If the object is moving fast, the Fog around its path will compress to let it go by. The air does not have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to move in the Fog <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> and so the motion is fairly efficient. For slower motions, efficiency is not so important, but if we wish to prevent slow-moving high-pressure areas from interfering with other airflow operations, we can enclose the object's zone in a self-contained convection <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> which moves <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s from in front to behind it.</p>
<p>Each moving layer of robots is similarly passing the next layer along, So each layer adds another increment of the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> difference of adjacent layers. Motors for arm extension can run at a gigahertz, and be geared down by a factor of 100 to the main screw in the arm. This will have a pitch of about a micron, giving a linear extension/retraction rate of about 10 meters per second. We can estimate the inter-layer shear rate at this <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>; the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">foglet</a>s are essentially pulling themselves along. Thus for a 100-micron interlayer distance Fog can sustain a 100 meter-per-second shear per millimeter of thickness.</p>
<p>The atomically-precise crystals of the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s' structural members will have a tensile strength of at least 100,000 psi (i.e. high for steel but low for the materials, including some fairly refractory ceramics, used in modern ``high-tech'' composites). At arms length of 100 microns, the Fog will occupy 10% of the volume of the air but has structural efficiency of only about 1% in any given direction. Thus Utility Fog as a bulk material will have a density (specific <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>) of 0.2; for comparison, balsa wood is about 0.15 and cork is about 0.25. Fog will have a tensile strength of only 1000 psi; this is about the same as low-density polyethylene (solid, not foam). The material properties arising from the lattice structure are more or less isotropic; the one exception is that when Fog is flowing, tensile strength perpendicular to the shear plane is cut roughly in half.</p>
<p>Without altering the lattice connectivity, Fog can contract by up to about 40% in any linear dimension, reducing its overall volume  (and increasing its density) by a factor of five. (This is of course done by retracting all arms but not letting go.) In this state the fog has the density of water. An even denser state can be attained by forming two interpenetrating lattices and retracting; at this point its density and strength would both be similar to ivory or Corian structural plastic, at specific <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> of 2 and about 6000 psi. Such high-density Fog would have the useful property of being waterproof (which ordinary Fog is not), but it cannot flow and takes much longer to change <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s in Detail</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s run on electricity, but they store <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> as an <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> buffer. We pick <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> in part because it's almost certain to be a fuel of choice in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> world, and thus we can be sure that the process of converting <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> to water and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, as well as the process of converting <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and water to <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>, will be well understood. That means we'll be able to do them efficiently, which is of prime importance.</p>
<p>Suppose that the Fog is flowing, layers sliding against each other, and some force is being transmitted through the flow. This would happen any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the Fog moved some non-Fog object, for example. Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> muscles oppose each other when holding something tightly, opposing forces along different <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> arms act to hold the Fog's shape and supply the required motion.</p>
<p>When two layers of Fog move past each other, the arms between may need to move as many as 100 thousand times per second. Now if each of those motions were dissipative, and the fog were under full load, it would need to consume 700 kilowatts per cubic centimeter. This is roughly the power dissipation in a .45 caliber cartridge in the millisecond after the trigger is pulled; i.e. it just won't do.</p>
<p>But nowhere near this amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is being used; the pushing arms are supplying this much but the arms being pushed are receiving almost the same amount, minus the work being done on the object being moved. So if the motors can act as generators when they're being pushed, each <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> budget is nearly balanced. Because these are arms instead of wheels, the intake and outflow do not match at any given instant, even though they average out the same over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (measured in tens of microseconds). Some buffering is needed. Hence the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>I should hasten to add that almost never would one expect the Fog to move actively at 1000 psi; the pressure in the column of Fog beneath, say, a ``levitated'' <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body is less than one thousandth of that. The 1000 psi capability is to allow the Fog can simulate hard objects, where forces can be concentrated into very small areas. Even so, current exploratory <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering designs for electric motors have power conversion densities up to a billion watts per cubic centimeter, and dissipative inefficiencies in the 10 parts per million range. This means that if the Empire State Building were being floated around on a column of Fog, the Fog would dissipate less than a watt per cubic centimeter.</p>
<p>Moving Fog will dissipate <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> by air turbulence and viscous drag. In the large, air will be entrained in the layers of moving Fog and forced into laminar flow. <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> consumed in this regime may be properly <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as necessary for the desired motion no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how it was done. As for the waving of the arms between layers, the Reynolds number decreases linearly with the size of the arm. Since the absolute <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of the arms is low, i.e. 1 m/s, the Reynolds number should be well below the ``lower critical'' value, and the arms should be operating in a perfectly viscous regime with no turbulence. The remaining effect, viscous drag (on the waving arms) comes to a few watts per square meter of shear plane per layer.</p>
<p>There will certainly be some waste heat generated by Fog at work that will need to be dissipated. This and other applications for heat pumps, such as heating or cooling people (no need to heat the whole house, especially since some people prefer different temperatures), can be done simply by running a flow of Fog through a pipe-like volume which changes in area, compressing and expanding the entrained air at the appropriate places.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a>s and Control</h1><p>In the macroscopic world, <a class="thought" href="entries/microcomputer_entry.html">microcomputer</a>-based controllers (e.g. the widely used Intel 8051 series microcontrollers) typically run on a clock speed of about 10 MHz. They emit control signals, at most, on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 10 KHz (usually less), and control motions in robots that are at most 10 Hz, i.e. a complete motion taking one tenth of a second. This million-clocks-per-<a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> is not strictly necessary, of course; but it gives us some concept of the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> rate we might expect for a given <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> clock rate in a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly controlled nanorobot.</p>
<p>Drexler's carefully detailed analysis shows that it is possible to build mechanical nanocomputers with gigahertz clock rates. Thus we can immediately expect to build a nanocontroller which can direct a 10 kilohertz <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. However, we can do better. Since the early microcontrollers were developed, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> has advanced. The 8051's do 1 instruction per 6, 12, or 18 clock cycles; modern RISC <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s execute 1 instruction per cycle. So far, nobody has bothered to build a RISC microcontroller, since they already have more computing power than they need. Furthermore, RISC designs are efficient in <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> as well as time; one early RISC was implemented on a 10,000-gate gate array. This design could be translated into rod <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> in less than one tenth of one percent of a cubic micron.</p>
<p>Each <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> is going to have 12 arms with three axis control each. In current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> it isn't uncommon to have a processor per axis; we could fit 36 processors into the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> but it isn't necessary. The tradeoffs in macroscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> today are such that processors are cheap; in the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> things are different. The control of the arms is actually much simpler than control of a macroscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. They can be managed by much simpler controllers that take commands like ``Move to point X at speed y.'' Using a RISC design allows a single processor to control a 100 kHz arm; using auxilliary controllers will let it do all 12 easily.</p>
<p>But there is still a problem: Each <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, even with the power-reducing reversible <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> designs espoused by Drexler, Merkle, and this author, is going to dissipate a few nanowatts. At a trillion <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">foglet</a>s per cubic meter, this is a few kilowatts per cubic meter. Cooling for such a dissipation must needs be somewhere between substantial and heroic. As long as the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can go into a standby mode when the Fog is standing still, however, this is quite workable. Concentrations of heavy work, mechanical or computing, would still require cooling circulation to some degree, but, as we have seen, the Fog is perfectly capable of doing that.</p>
<p>What about all the other computing overhead for the Fog? Besides the individual control of its robotic self, each <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a> will have to run a portion of the overall distributed control and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s. We can do another clock-speed to capability <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> from current <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. Megahertz-speed <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s find themselves well employed managing a handful of megabit <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> lines. Again we are forced to abandon the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering tradeoffs of the macroscopic world: routing of a message through any given <a class="thought" href="entries/node_entry.html">node</a> need theoretically consume only a handful of thermodynamically irreversible <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> operations; typical <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s controllers take millions. Special-purpose message <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>s designed with these facts in mind must be a part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>.</p>
<p>If the Fog were configured as a store-and-forward <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s with an average length of 100 bytes and a 1000-instruction overhead, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> would move through the Fog at 50 meters/second, i.e. 110 mph. It represents a highly inefficient use of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> even with special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. It will be necessary to design a more efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> protocol. Setting up ``virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s'' in the Fog and using optical repeaters (or simply mechanically <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing the optical waveguides) should help considerably.</p><h1>Synergistic Combination with Other Technologies</h1><p>The counterintuitive inefficiency in <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s is an example, possibly the most extreme one, of a case where macroscopic mechanisms outperform the Fog at some specific task. This will be even more true when we consider nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered macroscopic mechanisms. We could imagine a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-sized, that was formed of a collection of nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered parts held together by a mass of Utility Fog. The parts might include ``bones'', perhaps diamond-fiber composites, having great structural strength; motors, power sources, and so forth. The parts would form a sort of erector <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> that the surrounding Fog would assemble to perform the task at hand. The Fog could do directly all subtasks not requiring the excessive strength, power, and so forth that the special-purpose parts would supply.</p>
<p>The Fog house, or city, would resemble the Fog <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> in that regard. The roof of a house might well be specially <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered for qualities of waterproofness, solar <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> collection, and resistance to general abuse, far exceeding that which ordinary general purpose Fog would have. (On the other hand, the Fog could, if desired, have excellent insulating properties.) Of course the roof need not be one piece--it might be inch-square tiles held in place by the supporting Fog, and thus be quite amenable to rearrangement at the owner's whim, incremental repair and replacement, and all the other advantages we expect from a Fog house.</p>
<p>Another major <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> that would be special-purpose would be power and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. Working on more-efficient protocols such as suggested above, the Fog would form an acceptable <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s link from a person to some terminal in the same building; but it would be extremely inefficient for long-haul, high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> connections such as that needed for telepresence.</p>
<p>Power is also almost certainly the domain of special-purpose nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered mechanisms. Power transmission in the Fog is likely to be limited, although for different <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> transmission. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will give us an amazing array of power generation and distribution possibilities, and the Fog can use most of them. The critical heterogeneous <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of Fog is the Fog-producing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/foglet_entry.html">Foglet</a>s are not self-reproducing; there is no need for them to be, and it would complicate their design enormously to give them fine <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-manipulating capability. One imagines a Fog <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> the size of a breadbox producing Fog for a house, or building-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s filling cities with Fog. The Fog itself, of course, conveys raw materials back to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>Many thanks to Carl Feynman who analyzed the Fog and made numerous suggestions.</p><h1>Bibliography</h1><p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Consider all-pervasive utility fog, everywhere and everything.  As the article points out, this will have amazing potential for transforming our environments, and our lives.  Latent in every inch of space will be incredible computing power.  It is interesting to consider the distribution of computing power within an environment filled with utility fog.  As the article points out, there will be other structures embedded in the fog, serving special purpose tasks that general purpose fog is not appropraite for, such as power generation.  Such special purpose devices or materials are likely to have less computing power.  One such type of special purpose device is people.  People, as they are today, would be like little pockets of low-density computing power - within the all -pervasive, all-powerful fog.
<br>
<br>
Of course, it's an assumption that people will stay the same or even reasonably close to the current design.  Their bodies may be engineered or augmented in several ways - and may be able to make use of the computing power latent in the surrounding fog.  And of course, there's the possibility of embodying our minds within such a fog.  
<br>
<br>
The issue I want to raise, though, is of utility fog intelligence - and the possible consequences for beings (however augmented) within it, being completely outgunned by computing power that they are potentially at the mercy of.

<br>
There are two big assumptions with the Singularity people dont twig much:
<br>
<br>
1. Things will happen very fast when self-changing systems are introduced: this could conceivably be on Roadrunner in a Grid network; it is not logically possible to contain something in its parameters smarter than you are, despite marriage.
<br>
<br>
2. That we will act as one species and not radically differentiate. Huge de Garis has goes into this, but I see the differentiation as mushrooming.
<br>
<br>
The Amish will presumably stay homsapiens?
<br>
<br>
If we are very lucky, weak AI's will get better and better without anything reaching uncontainable AGI, and we will get the chance to Intelligence Augment ourselves subject to laws that restrict you going faster than the State.
<br>
<br>
If we have no state, and the guys at Los Alamos or Harvard build it, they may see the rest of us as a kind of bacteria and wipe us to prevent us ever reaching and competing with them for scarce universe resources.
