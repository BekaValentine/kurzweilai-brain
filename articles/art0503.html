   "Somebody says, 'You know, you people always say that <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> is continuous.
   How do you know when you get to a small enough dimension that there really are
   enough points in between, that it isn't just a lot of dots separated by little
   distances?' Or they say, 'You know those quantum mechanical amplitudes you
   told me about, they're so complicated and absurd, what makes you think those
   are right? Maybe they aren't right.' Such remarks are obvious and are
   perfectly clear to anybody who is working on this problem. It does not do any
   good to point this out."

</blockquote>
<p><b>1. Introduction</b>
<p>
<i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> [18], the 1280-page
   treatise by <i>Mathematica</i> creator Stephen Wolfram, has
   only a few things to say about <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. Yet the book's goal - to
   understand <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al terms - is one widely shared by the quantum
   computing community.  Thus, many in the field will likely be curious: is this
   2.5-kilogram tome worth reading?  Notwithstanding newspaper comparisons
   [6] to Darwin's <i>Origin of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">Species</a></i>, what is the
   book's actual <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>?  This review will not attempt a chapter-by-chapter
   evaluation, but will focus on two specific areas: <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>
   (Section 2), especially the claimed relevance of Wolfram's Principle of
   <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al Equivalence to
   NP-completeness
   (Section 2.1); and fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> (Section 3), especially <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>
   (Section 3.1) and Wolfram's attempt to account for Bell inequality violation in a
   classical model (Section 3.2).
<p>
   As a popularization, <i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> is an
   impressive accomplishment.  The book's main theme is that simple <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s can
   exhibit complex behavior.  For example, let
   p<sub>i,j</sub>=1
   if <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> (i,j)
   is colored black, and
   p<sub>i,j</sub>=0
   if white.  Then the 'Rule
   110'
   cellular automaton is defined by the recurrence
<p>p<sub>i+1,j</sub> = p<sub>i,j</sub> + p<sub>i,j+1</sub> - (1+p<sub>i,j-1</sub>)p<sub>i,j</sub>p<sub>i,j+1</sub>
<p>for i&gt;0,
   given some initial condition at
   i=0.
   Wolfram emphasizes that such an automaton, even when run with a simple initial
   condition such as a single black <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, can generate a complicated-looking
   image with no apparent repetitive or nested <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>.  This <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>,
   although well known to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming enthusiasts as well as professionals, will
   no doubt surprise many general readers.
</p>
<p>
   Using <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> as a framework, Wolfram moves on to discuss a range of
   topics - including the second law of thermodynamics, natural selection, plant
   and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> morphology, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, fluid <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a>, special and
   general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s and
   NP-completeness, <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s,
   <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a> and pseudorandomness, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> compression, statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>
   testing, G&#246;del's Theorem, axiomatic <a class="thought" href="entries/set_theory_entry.html">set theory</a>, and the Church-Turing
   thesis.  What is noteworthy is that he explains all of these without using
   formal notation.  To do so, he relies on about
   1000
   high-resolution graphics, which often (though not always) convey the ideas
   with as much precision as a formula would.  With suitable disclaimers,
   <i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> could form an excellent basis
   for an undergraduate general-<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> course.
</p>
<p>
   The trouble is that, as the title implies, Wolfram emphatically does not
   believe that he is using <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> to popularize known ideas.  In the
   introduction, he describes his finding that one-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>
   can produce complex behavior as one of the "more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant single discoveries
   in the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>" (p. 2).  He refers in the
   preface to "a crack in the very foundations of existing <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>," "new
   ideas and new <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s that ultimately depend very little on what has gone
   before," and "a vast array of applications - both <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual and
   practical - that can now be developed."  Comments of this character pervade
   the book.
</p>
<p>
   Significantly, there is no bibliography.  Instead there are
   349
   pages of endnotes, which summarize the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, from antiquity to the present,
   of each subject that Wolfram addresses.  The notes are fascinating; in many
   respects they constitute a better book than the main text.  However, in both
   the main text and in the notes, Wolfram generally brings up prior work only to
   dismiss it as misguided, or at best as irrelevant to his concerns.  For
   example, after relating his 'discovery' that there is apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> in
   the distribution of primes, Wolfram acknowledges that "the first few hundred
   primes were no doubt known even in antiquity, and it must have been evident
   that there was at least some <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> in their distribution" (p. 134).
<blockquote>
   However [he continues], without the whole intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> that I have
   developed in this book, the implications of this observation - and its
   potential connection, for example, to phenomena in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> - were not
   recognized.  And even though there has been a vast amount of mathematical work
   done on the sequence of primes over the course of many centuries, almost
   without exception it has been concerned not with <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> issues of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>
   but instead with trying to find specific kinds of regularities (p. 134).
</blockquote>
<p><b>2. <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">Complexity</a></b>
<p>
   In the opening chapter we are promised that Wolfram's new kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>
   "begins to shed new <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> on various longstanding questions in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al
   <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_theory_entry.html">complexity theory</a>" (p. 14).  On pages 758-764 we finally learn what this
   means.  By enumerating simple <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>s - say, all those with
   4
   states and
   2
   <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s - one can lower-bound the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of steps needed by any such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
   to perform a particular task.  To illustrate that simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can already
   display nontrivial behavior, Wolfram exhibits a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (call it
   M)
   that decides a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>
   L<sub>M</sub> in
   <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> exponential in the length of its input.  No <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> with at most
   4
   states can decide
   L<sub>M</sub> more
   efficiently, and Wolfram conjectures that
   M
   is 'irreducible,' meaning that no <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> with <i>any</i>
<a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of states can decide
   L<sub>M</sub> substantially
   more efficiently.
<p>
   It is unlikely that this enumeration approach scales even to
   5-state,
   2-<a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.  For let
   S(n),
   the
   n<sup>th</sup> 'Busy
   Beaver shift' <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, be the maximum <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of steps that an
   n-state,
   2-<a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can make before halting, when started on a blank tape.  Then as noted
   by Wolfram on p. 889, determining
   S(5) is
   still open; the best known lower bound, due to Marxen and Buntrock [12], is S(5)&gt;=47,176,870.
  The situation is even worse if the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can be started on a non-blank tape.
<p>
   Wolfram would reply that extremely short <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s are already of interest,
   since they can exhibit 'irreducible <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.'  And indeed, in Chapter 11 he
   gives a remarkable construction, due to his employee Matthew Cook, showing
   that even the Rule
   110
   cellular automaton is a universal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.  A corollary is that there exists
   a
   2-state,
   5-<a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>
   universal <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>.  However, such constructions inevitably rely on a
   complicated input encoding.  And given a problem of interest, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>
   multiplication, there seems to be nothing to suggest that an extremely short
   <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> exists to solve it using a standard
   encoding <a href="#1">(note 1)</a>.  So by restricting to
   extremely short programs, in effect we trade an infeasible search among
   programs for an infeasible search among input encoding schemes.
<p>
   Might it be worthwhile, though, to examine <i>tradeoffs</i>
   between running time and program size?  If we do this, then again we must not
   allow preprocessing of the input, since otherwise a constant-size program can
   always achieve within a polynomial factor of the optimal running time.  We
   therefore obtain complexity measures that are not 'robust' (in the traditional
   sense) under changes to the input representation.  Such measures might
   nevertheless have some interest for theoretical computer science.
<p>
   Elsewhere in the book, there are a few errors and oversights regarding
   complexity.  Wolfram says that minimizing a DNF expression (p. 1096) and
   computing a permanent (p. 1146) are NP-complete; they
   are respectively &#931;<sub>2</sub>P-complete
   (as shown by Umans [16]) and
   #P-complete
   (as shown by Valiant [17]).  Also, in Chapter 10, pseudorandom number
   generators based on cellular automata are proposed.  Wolfram suggests that,
   since certain questions involving cellular automata are
   NP-complete, these generators might be a good basis
   for cryptography <a href="#2">(note 2)</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
   To date [no] <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has been devised whose cryptanalysis is known to be
   NP-complete.  Indeed, essentially the only problem on which <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s have so far successfully been based is factoring of <a class="thought" href="entries/integer_entry.html">integer</a>s.  [And]
   while this problem has resisted a fair <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of attempts at solution, it is
   not known to be NP-complete (and indeed its ability to be solved in polynomial
   <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on a formal quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> may suggest that it is not) (p. 1089-1090).
</blockquote>
<p>
   There are two problems here.  First, all cryptanalysis problems are in NP intersect coNP,
   and thus cannot be NP-complete unless
   NP=coNP.
   Second, there is no shortage of candidate pseudorandom generators (or
   equivalently, candidate one-way functions; H&#229;stad et al. [9] showed
   that either can be obtained from the other).  Attention has focused on
   factoring - and on other '<a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>d' problems, involving elliptic curves,
   error-correcting codes, lattices, and so on - because of the need for
   <i>trapdoor</i> one-way functions in public-key <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a>.

<p><b>2.1. The Principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al
Equivalence</b>
<p>
   The final chapter proposes a 'Principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al Equivalence': that
   almost all <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that are not 'obviously simple' are in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>
   equivalent to a universal <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>.  Wolfram [19] emphasizes that
   this principle goes beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> in two ways: it asserts,
   first, that universality is pervasive in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>; and second, that universality
   arises in any sufficiently complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, without needing to be '<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered
   in.'  We confess that the principle still seems to us an <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of the
   conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> in theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>.  However, we will not
   debate this question in general terms.  Instead we will consider a specific
   implication that Wolfram offers for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
   In studying the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> of NP completeness what has mostly been done in the
   past is to try to construct particular <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of rather general problems
   that exhibit equivalence to other problems.  But almost always what is
   actually constructed is quite complicated - and certainly not something one
   would expect to occur at all often.  Yet on the basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> from the
   Principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al Equivalence I strongly suspect that in most cases
   there are already quite simple <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of general NP-complete problems that
   are just as difficult as any NP-complete problem.  And so, for example, I
   suspect that it does not take a cellular automaton nearly as complicated as
   [one with 19 colors given previously] for it to be an NP-complete problem to
   determine whether initial conditions exist that lead to particular behavior.
   (p. 769)
</blockquote>
<p>
   In <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of 'typical' <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of
   NP-complete
   problems has been investigated for decades.  Highlights include Levin's theory
   of average-case completeness [10] and studies of phase transitions in
   randomly generated combinatorial problems [5].  It remains open to show that
   some
   NP-complete
   problem is hard on average, under a simple distribution, so long as P!=NP.
   However, 'worst-case/average-case equivalence' has been shown for several
   cryptographic problems, including one studied by Ajtai and Dwork [1].
</p>
<p>
   As for the cellular automaton conjecture, its validity depends on how it is
   formulated.  Suppose we are given a one-dimensional, two-color cellular
   automaton on a lattice of bounded size
   n,
   and an ending condition E in {0,1}<sup>n</sup>.  Then
   we can decide in polynomial <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> whether there exists an initial condition
   that evolves to
   E
   in one or more steps, by using <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamic_programming_entry.html">dynamic programming</a>.  Extending this technique,
   we can decide whether there exists an initial condition that evolves to
   E
   in exactly
   t
   steps, where
   t=O(log n),
   by computing a list of all possible initial <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s for each contiguous
   block of
   t cells.
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, for any fixed polynomial-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> predicate &#934;,
   let Init<sub>110</sub>(&#934;) be
   the following problem.  We are given an ending condition
   E
   with
   n
   cells, and asked to decide whether there exists an initial condition
   I
   such that (i) &#934;(I)  holds,
   and (ii) the Rule
   110
   cellular automaton evolves
   I
   to
   E
   in exactly
   t
   steps.  Here
   t
   is a fixed polynomial in
   n.
   Then:
<p><b>Proposition 1.</b> For all
      &#934; and
      polynomials
      p,
      there is a polynomial-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> that solves a
      1-1/p(n) fraction
      of
      Init<sub>110</sub>(&#934;) <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s.
<p><b>Proof.</b> Consider a directed graph with
      2<sup>n</sup>
      vertices, one for each <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>, and edges corresponding to the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of
      Rule
      110.
      Each vertex has outdegree
      1,
      so the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of paths of length
      t
      is 2<sup>n</sup>.
      Thus, if
      E
      is chosen uniformly at random, then the expected <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of
      length-t
      paths ending at
      E
      is
      1,
      so this <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> is at most
      p(n) with
      probability at least
      1-1/p(n).
      In this case we can trace
      t
      steps backward from
      E
      in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>
      O(ntp(n)),
      maintaining a list of all possible predecessors, and then evaluate
      &#934; on
      each.
   </p>
<p>
   Nevertheless, since Rule
   110
   is universal, the following <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> suggests that
   Init<sub>110</sub>(&#934;) should
   be
   NP-complete for some
   &#934;.
   Given a Boolean formula
   &#936; and
   proposed solution
   X,
   we could create an initial condition
   I(&#936;,X)
   corresponding to a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> that checks whether
   X
   satisfies
   &#936;;
   and if it does, erases
   X,
   preserves &#936;,
   and goes into an 'accept' state
   A(&#936;).
   Then by having
   &#934; verify
   that the initial condition is of legal form, we could reduce the problem of
   whether
   &#936; is
   satisfiable to that of whether there exists a legal initial condition that
   evolves
   to E=A(&#936;).
<p>
   This <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> fails for an interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>.  Cook's proof that Rule
   110
   is universal relies on simulating 'cyclic tag <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s,' a variant of the tag
   <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s studied in the 1960's by Cocke and Minsky [4] among others (see also
   p. 670 of Wolfram).  However, though Wolfram does not discuss this explicitly
   in the book, the known simulations of <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>s by tag <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s require
   exponential slowdown.  To prove that
  Init<sub>110</sub>(&#934;) is
   NP-complete,
   what is needed is to show that Rule
   110
   allows <i>efficient</i> simulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>s.
<p>
   In summary, there are many fascinating <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> questions about
   one-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>, as well as about typical <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of
   NP-complete
   problems.  But it is unclear why the Principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al Equivalence
   should yield more insight into these questions than the standard techniques of
   <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.

<p><b>3. Fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a></b>
<p>
   The most interesting chapter of <i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i>
   is the ninth, on 'Fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a>.'  Here Wolfram confronts general
   <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, arguably the two most serious challenges to
   a view of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> based on deterministic <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>.  He conjectures
   that spacetime is discrete at the Planck scale, of about 10<sup>-33</sup> centimeters
   or
   10<sup>-43</sup> seconds.
   This conjecture is not new, and has received considerable attention recently
   in connection with the holographic principle [3] from <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>
   thermodynamics, which Wolfram does not
   discuss <a href="#3">(note 3)</a>.  But are new ideas
   offered to substantiate the conjecture?
</p>
<p>
   For Wolfram, spacetime is a <i>causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a></i>, in which
   events are vertices and edges specify the dependence relations between events.
   Pages 486-496 and 508-515 discuss in detail how to generate such a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>
   from a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules.  In particular, we could start with a finite
   undirected '<a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> graph'
   G,
   assumed to be regular with degree
   3
   (since higher-degree vertices can be replaced by cycles of
   degree-3
   vertices).  We then posit a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of update rules, each of which replaces a
   subgraph by another subgraph with the same <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of outgoing edges.  The new
   subgraph must preserve any symmetries of the old one.  Then each <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> in the
   causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> corresponds to an application of an update rule.  If updating
   <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>
   B
   becomes possible as a result of <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>
   A,
   then we draw an edge from
   A
   to
   B.
   As pointed out to us by Rowland [13], it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> the
   distinction between the causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> graph
   G.
<p>
   Properties of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> are defined in terms of
   G.
   For example, if the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of vertices in
   G
   at distance at most
   n
   from any given vertex grows as
   n<sup>D</sup>,
   then <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> can be said to have dimension
   D.
   (As for formalizing this definition, Wolfram says only that there are "some
   subtleties.  For example, to find a definite volume <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate one does still
   need to take some kind of limit - and one needs to avoid sampling too many or
   too few" vertices  (p. 1030).)  Similarly, Wolfram argues that the curvature
   <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> needed for general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, in particular the Ricci
   tensor <a href="#4">(note 4)</a>, can be read from the
   connectivity <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of
   G.
   Interestingly, to make the model as simple as possible, Wolfram does not
   associate a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> to each vertex of
   G,
   representing (say) the presence or absence of a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>.  Instead <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s
   are localized <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s, or 'tangles,' in
   G.
<p>
   An immediate problem is that one might obtain many nonequivalent causal
   <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, depending on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in which update rules are applied to
   G.
   Wolfram calls a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules that allows such nondeterministic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> a
   'multiway <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.'  He recognizes, but rejects, a possible connection to
   <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>:
<blockquote>
   The notion of 'many-figured <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>' has been discussed since the 1950s in the
   <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of the many-worlds interpretation of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>.  There are
   some similarities to the multiway <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that I consider here.  But an
   <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant difference is that while in the many-worlds approach, branchings are
   associated with possible observation or measurement events, what I suggest
   here is that they could be an intrinsic feature of even the very lowest-level
   rules for the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> (p. 1035-6).
</blockquote>
   It is unclear exactly what distinction is being drawn: is there any physical
   <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that is not associated with a <i>possible</i>
   observation or measurement?  In any case, Wolfram opts instead for rule sets
   that are 'causal invariant': that is, that yield the same causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>
   regardless of the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in which rules are applied.  As noted by Wolfram, a
   sufficient (though not necessary) condition for causal invariance is that no
   'replaceable' subgraph overlaps itself or any other replaceable subgraph.
<p>
   Wolfram points out an immediate <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> to special <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, wherein
   observers do not in general agree on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in which spacelike separated
   events occur, yet agree on any final outcome of the events.  He is vague,
   though, about how (say) the Lorentz transformations might be derived in a
   causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> model:
<blockquote>
   There are many subtleties here, and indeed to explain the details of what is
   going on will no doubt require quite a few new and rather abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s.
   But the general picture that I believe will emerge is that when <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s move
   faster they will appear to have more nodes associated with them (p. 529).
</blockquote>
   Wolfram is "certainly aware that many physicists will want to know more
   details," he says in the endnotes, about how a discrete model of the sort he
   proposes can reproduce known features of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>.  But, although he chose to
   omit technical formalism from the presentation, "[g]iven my own personal
   background in theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> it will come as no surprise that I have
   often used such formalism in the process of working out what I describe in
   these sections" (p. 1043).

<p><b>3.1. <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum Mechanics</a></b>
<p>
   Physicists' hunger for details will likely grow further when they read the
   section on 'Quantum Phenomena' (p. 537-545).  Here Wolfram's proposals are
   even more unorthodox than he seems to acknowledge.  He believes that quantum
   mechanics is only an approximation to an underlying classical (and most likely
   deterministic) theory.  He is <i>not</i> advocating a
   hidden-variable approach such as Bohmian mechanics, in which the state vector
   is supplemented by an 'actual' eigenstate of a particular observable.  Instead
   he thinks that, at the lowest level, the state vector is not needed at all; it
   is merely a useful construct for describing some (though presumably not all)
   higher-level phenomena.  Indeterminacy arises because of one's inability to
   know the exact state of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>:
<blockquote>
   [I]f one knew all of the underlying details of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> that makes up our
   <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, it should always be possible to work out the result of any
   measurement.  I strongly believe that the initial conditions for the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>
   were quite simple.  But like many of the processes we have seen in this book,
   the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> no doubt intrinsically generates apparent
   randomness.  And the result is that most aspects of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> that
   represents the current state of our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> will seem essentially random (p.
   543).
</blockquote>
   Similarly, Wolfram explains as follows why an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> has <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> properties:
   "...a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> which represents our whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> must also include us as
   observers.  And this means that there is no way that we can look at the
   <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> from the outside and see the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> as a definite <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>" (p. 538).
   An obvious question then is how Wolfram accounts for the possibility of
   <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, assuming BPP!=BQP.
   He gives an answer in the final chapter:
<blockquote>
   Indeed within the usual formalism [of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>] one can construct
   quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that may be able to solve at least a few specific problems
   exponentially faster than ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>s.  But particularly after my
   discoveries in Chapter 9 ['Fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a>'], I strongly suspect that even
   if this is formally the case, it will still not turn out to be a true
   representation of ultimate physical <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, but will instead just be found to
   reflect various idealizations made in the models used so far (p. 771).
</blockquote>
   In the endnotes, though, where he explains <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> in more detail,
   Wolfram seems to hedge about which idealizations he has in mind:
<blockquote>
   It does appear that only modest precision is needed for the initial
   amplitudes.  And it seems that perturbations from the environment can be
   overcome using versions of error-correcting codes.  But it remains unclear
   just what might be needed actually to perform for example the final
   measurements required (p. 1148).
</blockquote>
   One might respond that, with or without <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, Wolfram's proposals
   can be ruled out on the simpler ground that they disallow Bell inequality
   violations.  Wolfram, however, puts forward an imaginative <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> to
   account for bipartite entanglement.  When two <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s (or 'tangles' in the
   graph
   G)
   collide, long-range 'threads' may form between them, which remain in place
   even if the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s are later separated:
<blockquote>
   The picture that emerges is then of a background containing a very large
   <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of connections that maintain an approximation to three-dimensional
   <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, together with a few threads that in effect go outside of that <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> to
   make direct connections between <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s (p. 544).
</blockquote>
   The threads can produce Bell correlations, but are somehow too small (i.e.
   contain too few edges) to transmit <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a way that violates
   causality.  This is reminiscent of, for example, the 'multisimultaneity' model
   studied <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ally by Stefanov et al. [15].
            <p> There are several <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ions one could raise against this thread 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>. What we will show in Section 3.2 is that, <i>if</i> 
              one accepts two of Wolfram's own desiderata - <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a> and causal 
              invariance - then the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> fails. For now, though, we remark 
              that Wolfram says little about what, to us, is a more natural possibility 
              than the thread <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>. This is an explicitly <i>quantum</i> 
              cellular automaton or causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, with a unitary transition 
              rule. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> seems to be that he does not want continuity anywhere 
              in a model, not even in probabilities or amplitudes. In the notes, 
              he describes an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> with a quantum cellular automaton as 
              follows: 
            <blockquote>
   One might hope to be able to get an ordinary cellular automaton with a limited
   <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of possible values by choosing a suitable [phase rotation]
   &#952;
   [&#952;=&#960;/4
   and
   &#952;=&#960;/3 are
   given as examples in an illustration].  But in fact in non-trivial cases most
   of the cells generated at each step end up having distinct values (p. 1060).
</blockquote>
   This observation is unsurprising, given results in <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> to the
   effect that almost any nontrivial gate <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> is universal (that is, can
   approximate any unitary <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> to any desired precision, or any orthogonal
   <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> in case one is limited to reals).  Indeed, Shi [14] has shown that a
   Toffoli gate <a href="#5">(note 5)</a> plus any gate that
   does not preserve the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al basis, or a
   controlled-NOT
   gate plus any gate whose <i>square</i> does not preserve the
   <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al basis, are both universal gate sets.  In any case, Wolfram does
   not address the fact that continuity in amplitudes seems more 'benign' than
   continuity in measurable quantities: the former, unlike the latter, does not
   enable an infinite amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to be performed in a finite <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.
   Also, as observed by Bernstein and Vazirani [2], the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ity of quantum
   mechanics implies that small errors in amplitudes cannot be magnified during a
   quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.

         <b>R</b> yields
         a unique causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>.

         is always considered to act on a fixed graph, not on a distribution or
         superposition over graphs.  This is true even if parts of the initial graph
         are chosen at random, and even if
         <b>R</b>
         is probabilistic.
</li></ol>
<p>
   Our goal is to show that, for any
   <b>R</b>,
   at least one of these assertions is false.  Current physical theory would
   suggest that (1)-(3) are true and that (4) is false.  Wolfram, if we
   understand him correctly, starts with (4) as a premise, and then introduces
   causal invariance to satisfy (1) and (2), and long-range threads to satisfy
   (3).  Of course, even to state the two-party Bell inequalities requires some
   notion of randomness.  And on pages 299-326, Wolfram discusses three
   mechanisms for introducing randomness into a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>: randomness in initial
   conditions, randomness from the environment (i.e. probabilistic updating
   rules), and intrinsic randomness (i.e. deterministic rules that produce
   pseudorandom output).  However, all of these mechanisms are compatible with
   (4), and so our argument will show that they are inadequate assuming (1)-(3).
   Our conclusion is that, in a model of the sort Wolfram considers, randomness
   must play a more fundamental role than he allows.
<p>
   In a standard Bell <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob are given input bits
   x<sub>A</sub> and
   x<sub>B</sub> respectively,
   chosen uniformly and independently at random.  Their goal is, without
   communicating, to output bits
   y<sub>A</sub> and
   y<sub>B</sub>
   respectively such that
<p>y<sub>A</sub> XOR y<sub>B</sub> = x<sub>A</sub> AND x<sub>B</sub>.
 <p>Under any 'local hidden variable' theory, <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob can succeed with
   probability at most
   3/4;
   the optimal strategy is for them to ignore their inputs and output (say)
   y<sub>A</sub>=0 and
   y<sub>B</sub>=0.
   However, suppose <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> has a qubit
   &#961;<sub>A</sub> and
   Bob a
   &#961;<sub>B</sub>,
   that are jointly in the Bell state (|00&gt;+|11&gt;)/sqrt(2).
   Then there is a protocol <a href="#6">(note 6)</a> by
   which they can succeed with probability
   (5+sqrt(2))/8, or about 0.802.
<p>
   We model this situation by letting
   A
   and
   B,
   corresponding to <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob, be disjoint subgraphs of a graph
   G.
   We suppose that, at a large scale,
   G
   approximates a Euclidean <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> of some dimension; and that any causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>
   obtained by applying updates to
   Gapproximates
   a Minkowski spacetime.  We can think of
   G
   as containing long-range threads from
   A
   to
   B,
   though the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the threads will not affect our conclusions.  We encode
   <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s input
   x<sub>A</sub> by
   (say) placing an edge between two specific vertices in
   A
   if and only if
   x<sub>A</sub>=1.
   We encode
   x<sub>B</sub>
   similarly, and also supply <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob with arbitrarily many correlated
   random bits.  Finally we stipulate that, at the end of the protocol, there is
   an edge between two specific vertices in
   A
   if and only if
   y<sub>A</sub>=1,
   and similarly for
   y<sub>B</sub>.
   A technicality is that we need to be able to identify which vertices
   correspond to
   x<sub>A</sub>,
   y<sub>A</sub>,
   and so on, even as
   G
   evolves over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.  We could do this by stipulating that (say) "the
   x<sub>A</sub> vertices
   are the ones that are roots of complete <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a> trees of depth
   3,"
   and then choosing the rule <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to guarantee that, throughout the protocol,
   exactly two vertices have this property.
</p>
<p>
   Call a variable 'touched' after an update has been applied to a subgraph
   containing any of the variable's vertices.  Also, let
   Z
   be an assignment to all random variables: that is,
   x<sub>A</sub>,
   x<sub>B</sub>,
   the correlated random bits, and the choice of randomness if
   <b>R</b> is
   probabilistic.  Then for all
   Z
   we require the following, based on what observers in different inertial frames
   could perceive:
<ol>
<li>
         There exists a sequence of updates under which
         y<sub>A</sub> is
         output before any of Bob's variables are touched.
   <li value="2">
         There exists another sequence under which
         y<sub>B</sub> is
         output before any of <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s variables are touched.
</li></li></ol>
<p>
   Then it is easy to see that, if Bell inequality violation occurs, then causal
   invariance must be violated.  Given
   Z,
   let y<sub>A</sub><sup>(1)</sup>(Z),y<sub>B</sub><sup>(1)</sup>(Z)
   be the values of y<sub>A</sub>,y<sub>B</sub> that
   are output under rule sequence (i), and let   y<sub>A</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(Z),y<sub>B</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(Z) be
   the values output under sequence (ii).  Then there must exist some
   Z
   for which either
 y<sub>A</sub><sup>(1)</sup>(Z) != y<sub>A</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(Z)  
   or
   y<sub>B</sub><sup>(1)</sup>(Z) != y<sub>B</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(Z) - for
   if not, then the entire protocol could be simulated under a local hidden
   variable model.  It follows that the outcome of the protocol can depend on the
   <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in which updates are applied.
<p>
   To obtain Bell inequality violation, something like the following seems to be
   needed.  We can encode 'hidden variables' into
   G,
   representing the outcomes of the possible measurements Bob could make on
   &#961;<sub>B</sub>.
   (We can imagine, if we like, that the update rules are such that observing any
   one of these variables destroys all the others.  Also, we make no assumption
   of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>uality.)  Then, after <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> measures
   &#961;<sub>A</sub>,
   using the long-range threads she updates Bob's hidden variables conditioned on
   her measurement outcome.  Similarly, Bob updates <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s hidden variables
   conditioned on his outcome.  Since at least one party must <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> its hidden
   variables for there to be Bell inequality violation, causal invariance is
   still violated.  But a sort of probabilistic causal invariance holds, in the
   <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that if we marginalize out
   A
   (the '<a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>' part of
   G),
   then the <i>distribution</i> of values for each of Bob's
   hidden variables is the same before and after <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s update.  The lesson is
   that, if we want both causal invariance and Bell inequality violation, then we
   need to introduce probabilities at a fundamental level - not merely to
   represent <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob's subjective uncertainty about the state of
   G,
   but even to define whether a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules is or is not causal invariant.
<p>
   Note that we made no assumption about how the random bits were
   generated - i.e. whether they were 'truly random' or were the pseudorandom
   output of some updating rule.  Our conclusion is also unaffected if we
   consider a 'deterministic' variant of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Bell\'s Theorem')">Bell's theorem</a> due to Greenberger,
   Horne, and Zeilinger [8], discussed by Wolfram on p. 1065.  There three
   parties, <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>, Bob, and Charlie, are given input bits
   x<sub>A</sub>,
   x<sub>B</sub>,
   and
   x<sub><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a></sub>
   respectively, satisfying the promise that
<p>x<sub>A</sub> + x<sub>B</sub> + x<sub><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a></sub> = 0 (mod 2).
   <p>The goal is to output bits
   y<sub>A</sub>,
   y<sub>B</sub>,
   and
   y<sub><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a></sub> such
   that
            <p>y<sub>A</sub> + y<sub>B</sub> + y<sub><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a></sub> = 1 - (1-x<sub>A</sub>)(1-x<sub>B</sub>)(1-x<sub><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a></sub>) 
              (mod 2). 
            <p>Under a local hidden variable model, there is no protocol that succeeds on all
   four possible inputs; but if the parties share the GHZ state (|011&gt;+|101&gt;+|110&gt;-|000&gt;)/2,
   then such a protocol exists.  However, although the
   <i>output</i> is correct with certainty, assuming causal
   invariance one cannot <i><a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a></i> the protocol without
   introducing randomness into the underlying rules, precisely as for the
   two-party Bell inequality.
<p>
   After a version of the above argument was circulated, Rowland [13]
   claimed that the argument fails for the following <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>.  We assumed that
   there exist two sequences of updating events, one in which <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s measurement
   precedes Bob's and one in which Bob's precedes <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s.  But we neglected the
   possibility that a <i>single</i> update, call it
   E,
   is applied to a subgraph that straddles the long-range threads.  The <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>
   E
   would encompass both <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob's measurements, so that neither would
   precede the other in any sequence of updates.  We could thereby obtain a rule
   <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>
<b>R</b> satisfying
   assertions (1), (3), and (4).
<p>
   We argue that such an
   <b>R</b> would
   nevertheless fail to satisfy (2).  For in effect we start with a flat
   Minkowski spacetime, and then take two distinct events that are simultaneous
   in a particular inertial frame, and identify them as being the
   <i>same</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>
   E.
   This can be visualized as 'pinching together' two horizontally separated
   points on a spacetime diagram.  (Actually a whole 'V' of points must be
   pinched together, since otherwise entanglement could not have been created.)
   However, what happens in a different inertial frame?  It would seem that
   E,
   a single <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, is perceived to occur at two separate times.  That by itself
   might be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> acceptable, but it implies that there exists a class of
   preferred inertial frames: those in which
   E
   is perceived to occur only once.  Of course, even in a flat spacetime, one
   could designate as 'preferred' those frames in which <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> and Bob's
   measurements are perceived to be simultaneous.  A crucial distinction, though,
   is that there one only obtains a class of preferred frames after deciding
   which <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> at <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s location, <i>and</i> which at Bob's
   location, should count as the 'measurement.'  Under Rowland's <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>, by
   contrast, once one decides what counts as the measurement at <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a>'s location,
   the decision at Bob's location is made automatically, because of the
   identification of events that would otherwise be far apart.

<p><b>4. Conclusion</b>
<p>
   Steven Levy [11] opines in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i> that "probably the
   toughest criticism [of <i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i>] will
   come from those who reject Wolfram's ideas because the evidence for his
   <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ions is based on observing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s contained inside <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s."  In
   our opinion, however, it is preferable to judge the book on its own terms - to
   grant, that is, that many complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s might indeed be fruitfully
   understood in terms of simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s.  The question is, what does the
   book tell us about such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, beyond what was known from 'traditional
   <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>'?
</p>
<p>
   This review focused on two fields, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and fundamental
   <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, which Wolfram claims are transformed by the discoveries in his book.
   We made no attempt to assess the book's relevance to other fields such as
   <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>.
<p>
   In <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, we argued that Wolfram often recapitulates
   existing ideas (such as pseudorandomness and the intractability of simple
   <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of NP-complete problems), albeit without
   precise definitions or proofs, and with greater claims of significance.  On
   the other hand, some of the book's <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s - such as the explicit
   constructions of <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>s - may be of interest to theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
   scientists.
</p>
<p>
   In <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, the book proposes that spacetime be viewed in terms of causal
   <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s arising from graph rewriting <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.  The causal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> models are
   intriguing, and in our opinion merit further mathematical study.  However,
   their relevance to <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> is difficult to evaluate without the details that
   Wolfram declines to supply.  As for the proposal that a deterministic,
   relativistically invariant, causal invariant model underlies quantum
   mechanics, we argued that it fails - even if <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> breaks down for
   more than two <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, and even if, as Wolfram suggests, one allows
   long-range threads to connect entangled <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s.  Exactly what kinds of
   classical models could underlie <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> is a question of great
   <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance, but Wolfram makes no serious effort to address the question.
</p>
<p>
<i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> was published by Wolfram's own
   company, and was not subject to outside editing or peer review.  If it were
   (say) a creationist tract, then this unusual route to publication would be of
   little consequence: for then no amount of editing would have improved it, and
   few scientifically literate readers would be misled by it.  What is
   unfortunate in this case is that outside editing would probably have made a
   substantial difference.  In an endnote, Wolfram explains that "[p]erhaps I
   might avoid some criticism by a greater display of modesty [in the text], but
   the cost would be a drastic <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in clarity" (p. 849).  However, were
   the book more cautious in its claims and more willing to acknowledge previous
   work, it would likely be easier for readers to assess what it does offer: a
   cellular-automaton-based perspective on existing ideas in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.  Thus, we
   believe the book would be not only less susceptible to criticism, but also
   clearer.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Oddly, this review gives A New Kind of Science increased credibility. You have effectively dismissed the most obvious and immediate concern of the general reader: that Wolfram is just plain nuts. I am finding this to be the case in other reviews. Another thing: most of the flaws in his theory that are being presented here and elsewhere seem amenable to repair. It appears to me that the only real issue left is that Wolfram's central thesis may simply be too vague and too general to be useful. Someone needs to find a specific way to apply it. When some sharp-eyed scientist or mathematician says 'eureka' and shows the world what Wolfram's ideas are good for, this will make an impression. For now, it's just a lot of talk. A New Kind of Science will never die, but it may fade away.</p></td>

Excellent point. Actually, if Wolfram had called his book A New Kind of Mathematics he could have avoided all the furor'he obviously didn't want to. As for telling a mathematician his work has no application, you may as well tell a master of Haute Couture that his designs are not practical for everyday wear.

Not in this case. And why not? Be cause it's not understood well, by others also.
<br>
<br>
It hasn't been understood by von Neumann, who made an earlier version. Everybody just grabed it, as a piece of gold. But it wasn't a gold.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, the situation is not very clear. Not even for people involved.

<br>
In 1900, most biologists were not Darwinians. Remember that! It's not a proof, that it is the same sitiation in QM now. It's a proof, that peers can be wrong!

The treatment was thoughtful and complete. Maybe too thoughtful. However, I find that I cannot be quite so even-handed in my comments about Wolfram's book. 
<br>
<br>
I was annoyed by his arrogant belief that somehow there is more to his idea than a clever restatement of the obvious -- that simple programs can exhibit complex behavior. (Any programmer can attest to that when trying to "debug" even the simplest of programs.) I was put off by his lack of references, even to point the reader to background information. And I found that his frequent use of the words "I suspect that it will be found..." seems more appropriate to a statement of opinion rather than a "new kind of science". I suspect that Wolfram published the book himself because he suspected (correctly) that he would not find a publisher.
<br>
<br>
In summary, I found the book to be, largely, a self-serving restatement of the obvious. It lacked the technical "meat" needed to satisfy the expert, and was too obtuse to be understood readily by the layman.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>     I have read about 75% of Wolfram's opus.  I'll pick it up again when I have some time...but my three observations:
<br>
<br>
    1.  Wolfram has a knack for seeming to claim the earlier work of others as his own, or at least downplaying others' contributions.  He overstates the importance of his observations.  The hubris is a little wearisome.  (And it's apparently not just in the book.  In a couple of interviews I've read, Wolfram compares himself to Isaac Newton.)
<br>
<br>
    2.  Wolfram's simple thesis, that complex phenomena can be explained by simple computer programs is not all that earth-shattering.  He already said as much 20 years ago.  Others have said similar things, and the idea is worth pursuing.  But for all its heft,  the book doesn't do much to advance the argument.  There's a lot of suggestion, but not a lot of concrete theory.
<br>
<br>
    3.  Wolfram seriously underestimates the importance of natural selection in biology.  He discusses how simple CA-programs might be responsible for certain features found in organisms (seashell markings, for one).  Other scientists have come to similar conclusions, some as early as the 1950s.    But from there, he goes on to suggest that Darwinian natural selection might not be very important in explaining the complexity of the biosophere.  Here, he makes a fundamental error.    CA-type programs might determine the markings of seashells, for instance--but if the program generates a pattern that makes the organism more likely to be eaten before it reproduces, I guarantee that pattern will quickly disappear from the population.  Simple programs might determine what natural selection has to work with, but selection determines what survives.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I found this review by far the best and most detailed analysis to date of all the reviews of Wolfram's magnum opus. By restricting his comments to two distinct areas - computational complexity and fundamental physics, Scott Aaronson showed three things:
<br>
a) that such areas are far from fully understood or exhaustively described by current science
<br>
b) that while Wolfram has accomplished a considerable degree of insight, that insight is not totally original nor immediately applicable, and 
<br>
c) that such problems are extremely difficult and worth challenging afresh.
<br>
<br>
The review treats Wolfram's book seriously, as it fully deserves, and opens his ideas to further discussion and analysis, which is how science really progresses and is the real fun associated with such publications. I agree that the book would have been better served by editorial control, but what editor could have ever accomplished such a task, unless he is a polymath on the same level as Wolfram? Clearly no simple candidate springs to mind. If then a tribe of editors were employed the cost and single mindedness of the work would suffer.
<br>
<br>
I have difficulties with many details of the book, but find its overall conception and linking of the major ideas in science, maths and philosophy exhilarating. It correctly concludes that:
<br>
1) Computing is THE premier tool of science and thought, as well as a model of nature.
<br>
2) That any comprehensive theory of maths and science must account for the central role of undecidability, incompleteness and universality in theoretical and natural systems, as posited by the great theorems of Godel and Turing, and
<br>
3) In order for computers to be intuitively usable, then there needs to be a powerful, pattern and rule based language like Mathematica, which allows the extension of mathematical constructs within a computing environment.
<br>
<br>
If for nothing else, Wolfram successfully makes the case for all of the above, though his real aims were far more general. In fact, little of the book would have been achievable had Mathematica not already been developed. Users of this astounding program have little difficulty adapting to the ideas of ANKS, since many of the ideas are implicit in the design of the Mathematica language.
<br>
<br>
My feeling about theories expounded by statistical outlier intellects like Wolfram is that they offer extraordinary insight into problems which come from an uncommon intuition and that such approaches, even when they are incorrect, still lead to very fertile concepts. Take the mathematician Riemann for example, many of his theories were more like conjectures and often the proofs were erroneous, but he opened up vistas of beautiful insights that still intrigue today. 
<br>
<br>
However almost all reviewers ignore the very best aspect of the book: that it can be investigated and experimented with directly on computer, either by using the Explorer program, or better still by downloading and applying the underlying Mathematica programs. There has not been any other intellectual work of such magnitude that direcly invites the reader to participatre in the ideas and discoveries that it describes. This is unique and lots of fun. I would have more respect for other reviewers if they at least attempted a proper first scientific analysis by trying to replicate the experiments the book describes and then construct their criticisms by possibly finding fault with the given programs. After Galileo published his book on the moon he was widely and thoroughly condemned, which especially troubled him, because as he said, none of his vociferous critics bothered to look through a telescope.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>After reading Mr. Wolfram's overly extended description of his thesis about how complexity originates from simple algorithms, I find his musings to be rather vaguely illustrated. In his book, Wolfram mentions the relationship between his mathematical rules (such as rule 110) and the formation of the universe, but does not attempt to bridge the gap between the two. After looking at the illustrations of the recursive natural patterns of plant life (such as tree branches), I hoped to find a "rule" that truly attempted to approximate them. Instead, I only read about 2 dimensional sheets of endlessly bombarding and cascading lines and shapes, and not even a fairly complex 3 dimensional representation of nature to support his theory. 
<br>
In short, the book (being an unfinished work) has left me asking for more depth and elaboration.
<br>
<br>
From a mathematical perspective, I was really looking forward to a better compilation than what I read, and unfortunately, the yellow pages provide more ordered and complete arrangements of numbers within 1000+ pages of text than Mr. Wolfram's book does.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>A new kind of science. 
<br>
<br>
Yes, we urgenly need this one. The present science has been becoming an old one. It has got number of branches like in a tree. But what we have forgot the main thing that is the root, the place where original things begin. Big disadvantage of the present ultra modern science is that it has been going without the very basic knowledge of nature or universe. 
<br>
<br>
Our universe is in name 'One', and in action it is 'Two'. First, we must understand this basic principle of universe. Our universe is working in a strict rule. The universe as a whole and in a particle level, it is ruled by a single and simple rule. 
<br>
<br>
Now we are discussing about the singularity and dualism. This discussion is not new, now only. It is the centuries old controversial subject. 
<br>
<br>
Atom is one in name, but really it is two things. In the same way the universe is one but in action it is two. so, we couldn't come to an solid idea about these things. We need a new approach to understand the universe. Then only we can reach the destination. 
<br>
<br>
Universe is one, but it has two forces as dark and light. Actually, there is no dark and light energy, but it is darkless dark and lightless light energy. What we are seeing as light and dark is nothing but illusion. Our capacity of understanding could not go into that extent. 
<br>
<br>
Regarding Black hole, the present statements are confusing with one another. There are only two energy or foces, as I have mentioned, in universe. We see many celestial, bodies in our universe, like sun and stars. They all are working individually as is the universe works in general. 
<br>
<br>
What the sun and other celestial bodies have contained within it?  ? What is inside in it is the same that what is outside. Just as a simple atom, when it loses its more electrons, it will explode or change its originality. Anyhow,  simply the 'Two' things are behaving as different things. So, now what we see is illusion and what we see not is real. We can say this as 'Reality'.
<br>
<br>
I will give more details to convince all through my future articles.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.</p></td>
