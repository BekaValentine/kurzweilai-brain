<p>The demise of the book has been planned for centuries. This came 
              first by fiat, with bannings and burnings, and more recently by 
              design, with new <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> promising to make old books obsolete. Today's 
              book-of-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is the <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a>, offering video and sounds and 
              cross-references to enhance ordinary text. Who would ever want to 
              go back to reading a book that just has words?</p>
<p>Just about everyone. The state of the book business can be seen 
              at the Frankfurt book fair, the annual <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> where the publishing 
              world gathers to buy and sell books. It dates all the way back to 
              the fifteenth century, shortly after the development of movable 
              metal type created the need for a new kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> marketplace. 
              Approaching the end of the millennium the fair is flourishing, with 
              hundreds of thousands of books and people on display. The only exception 
              is the short lines and long faces in the hall displaying books on 
              disk. People are voting with their fingers.</p>
<p>You don't need to look beyond the book you're holding to understand 
              why. Think about its specifications. A book:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> boots instantly</li>
<li>has a high-contrast, high-resolution display</li>
<li>is viewable from any angle, in bright or dim <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a></li>
<li>permits fast random <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to any page</li>
<li>provides instant visual and tactile feedback on the location</li>
<li>can be easily annotated</li>
<li>requires no batteries or maintenance</li>
<li>is robustly packaged</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>A laptop meets exactly none of those specifications. If the book 
              had been invented after the laptop it would be hailed as a great 
              breakthrough. It's not technophobic to prefer to read a book; it's 
              entirely sensible. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of computing lies back in a book.</p>
<p>Isn't it curious that a book doesn't need a backlight? A laptop 
              screen requires a power-hungry lamp, and even so isn't legible in 
              bright <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> or from an angle. Under those same circumstances a 
              book continues to look great, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why is surprisingly 
              interesting.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> in a laptop starts its journey in a fluorescent tube 
              behind the display. It's guided by a panel that spreads the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> 
              across the screen, losing some away from the screen. The <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> then 
              passes through a polarizing filter that transmits the part of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> that is oriented in one direction, while absorbing the 
              rest of it. Next come the control electrodes and then the liquid 
              crystal. This is a fluid that can rotate the orientation of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> based on a voltage applied by a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, which absorbs 
              still more <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. Finally the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> passes through color filters 
              and a final polarizer, each taking its cut out. The result is that 
              most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> is wasted inside the display. The fraction that 
              trickles out must then compete with the ambient <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> around the 
              display to be seen. And since the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> that does emerge must make 
              its way through this obstacle course, it continues on in the same 
              direction straight out, leaving very little to be seen at an angle 
              to the display.</p>
<p>A piece of paper takes a much more sensible approach. The fibers 
              that make up a sheet are actually translucent. <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a> striking the 
              paper gets bent as it passes through a fiber, and since there are 
              so many fibers this happens many times in many directions. The result 
              of all this scattering is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> spreads through the paper 
              much like the spread of a drop of ink, eventually leaking back out. 
              And just as the shape of a blob of spreading ink doesn't depend 
              much on the angle at which a pen is held, the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> comes out of 
              the paper in all directions, independent of how it arrived at the 
              paper. This <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>, called <i>optical weak localization</i>, 
              is what makes paper (or a glass of milk) appear to be white. It's 
              a very efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for converting <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of most any color and 
              orientation into uniform background illumination for text on the 
              page. Crucially, like an aikido master redirecting an incoming attacker, 
              this mechanism takes advantage of the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> already in a room rather 
              than trying to overpower it the way a backlight does.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, as I started spending <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> with publishing companies 
              as well as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> companies, I was struck by how strange it is 
              to replace paper with displays that are guaranteed to be bulkier, 
              take more power, and look worse. If paper is such a good <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, 
              why not continue to use it? The one advantage that a liquid crystal 
              panel has over a sheet of paper is that it can change. Joe Jacobson 
              came to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab to fix that.</p>
<p>He found that the key to making smart paper is a process called 
              <i>microencapsulation</i>. This process grows tiny shells of one 
              material around a core of another one. A familiar success of microencapsulation 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>less copy paper. It used to be that to make a copy of a 
              receipt when it was written, one had to slide in a sheet of an invariably 
              messy paper that had an ink on it that could be transferred by writing 
              on it, or touching it, or holding it, or rubbing it on your clothes. 
              Now it's possible to get a copy simply by writing on what looks 
              like an ordinary piece of paper. The <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>less copy paper has been 
              coated with small <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s containing ink. The act of writing on 
              it applies enough force to break open the shells, releasing the 
              ink onto the sheet below. Simply touching the paper doesn't have 
              enough force to break the shells, which leaves the ink encapsulated 
              where it belongs.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a> of microencapsulation is that it's also cheap. There's 
              no need for a tiny assembly line to fill the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s; this is 
              done by a straightforward chemical process. A solution is formed 
              of drops of ink of the appropriate size in another liquid. Then 
              a material is introduced that grows only at the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> between 
              the two liquids. Once it has had <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to form a thick enough shell 
              around the droplets, the newly microencapsulated <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s can be 
              separated out from the liquid.</p>
<p>The toner used in a <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> or copier consists of small <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s 
              that get fused to a piece of paper and absorb <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. Joe's group 
              has developed a way to make microencapsulated <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s about the 
              size of toner (smaller than the thickness of a hair), which contain 
              still smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s. The inner <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s come in two types, 
              one white and the other black. They also have a different electric 
              charge stored on them. This means that in an electric field all 
              of the white <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s will go to one side of the outer shell and 
              the black <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s to the other. If the field is reversed, they 
              will change sides. The result looks just like toner, because it 
              essentially is, but it's a kind of toner that can be <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ed on 
              and off. They call this <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ink.</p>
<p>The first thing that can be done with e-ink is to cover a sheet 
              with it to make reusable paper. Instead of ending up in a recycling 
              bin, the paper can go back into the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> after it's used. A conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> has a complex mechanism to spread toner or ink over a page. 
              Reusable paper starts with the smart toner already on it; the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              just needs a row of electrodes to <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s on and off. 
              And since the process is reversible, the paper can go back through 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> to be reprinted over and over again. Reusable paper 
              is needed because tomorrow's paperless office has turned into today's 
              insatiable consumer of paper, carting in reams of paper to fly through 
              ever-faster <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>s and just as quickly be thrown out. Reusable 
              paper ends this high-tech deforestation by recycling the paper right 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>. Instead of filling your trash with newsprint, a 
              newspaper printed on reusable paper can go back into the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              at the end of the day to reemerge printed with the next day's news.</p>
<p>Even better than reusing a sheet of paper is changing it while 
              you watch. There's enough room to drive a microelectronic truck 
              through the thickness of a sheet of paper. This means that the electrodes 
              needed to <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s can be moved from the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> to 
              the paper itself. Forming a sandwich of paper, <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, and electrodes 
              creates a new kind of display. But unlike any other display this 
              one works just like printing and therefore can be viewed from most 
              any angle in most any <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, and it retains its image when the power 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ed off. And even though the original goal of the project 
              was to make displays that would look beautiful but be changed infrequently, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s can <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> quickly enough to approach the rate needed 
              to show the moving images of a video.</p>
<p>Joe's group began developing a <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> to put the electrodes onto 
              a sheet of paper to make <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ink displays and soon realized 
              that they could bring still more capabilities to a piece of paper. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated circuit</a>s are made by depositing conducting and insulating 
              materials onto a wafer held inside a chamber that has had all the 
              air evacuated so that it doesn't react. The head of his group's 
              remarkable prototype <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> accomplishes the same thing under air 
              on a desktop by creating a tiny plasma column, like a miniature 
              lightning bolt. This delivers to the surface the materials needed 
              to print <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s such as wires and <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. They developed 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> to put down display <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s to address <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> pixels 
              on the paper, but there's plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> compared to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> to add other functions.</p>
<p>The most exciting prospect of all is called radio paper. Since 
              it takes very little <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ink <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s 
              they can be driven by a solar <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, which is essentially a big <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              that can be deposited by the <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>. By printing still 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, a radio receiver could be integrated with the 
              paper. Now your newspaper doesn't even have to go into the <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> 
              at the end of the day. If you leave it out on your coffee table, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> in the room will power its <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, which will receive 
              a radio signal with the news to update the page. The <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry can 
              then flip the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s to reprint the page to have the day's news 
              waiting for you whenever you pick up the paper. Bad news for birdcages 
              and yesterday's fish: this would be a newspaper that is never out-of-date. 
              While there's still a lot of work to do to make radio paper a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, 
              the essential <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s have already been shown in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Actively updating a newspaper points to the ultimate application 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ink: the universal book. Sheets of paper covered with 
              the microencapsulated <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s and electrodes can be assembled 
              into a book, with control <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s embedded in the spine. This 
              would look and feel like any other book, since it's made out of 
              the same ingredients of paper and toner. The only difference is 
              that this book can change. After reading it, you can <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s through the binding and onto the pages. This can even be 
              done while you read. Pages other than the one you're looking at 
              can be changing, so that all of <i>War and Peace</i> could be read 
              in a pamphlet of just a few pages.</p>
<p>The great innovation of Gutenberg and his peers was not the printing 
              press, which was just a converted wine press; it was movable metal 
              type. Before then printing was done from wooden blocks that had 
              to be laboriously engraved. Movable type made it possible for a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a> to produce a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of type that could be used to print all 
              books, arranging the letters as needed for each page. <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> 
              ink takes this idea to its logical conclusion, moving the toner 
              instead of the type. Now a reader can own just one book that can 
              be any book, which can arrange the ink as needed for each page. 
              Instead of going to a library to check out a book, the bits of the 
              book can be <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed onto the pages of an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> book.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> book ends the argument over old-fashioned books 
              versus new-fashioned bits by recognizing that both sides have strong 
              technical cases that can be combined. There are deep <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s why 
              the old technologies in a book work so well, and there are new ways 
              to emulate and adapt them. What jumps out the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that you 
              see a Gutenberg Bible is the glossiness of the ink. It turns out 
              that Gutenberg made his inks by cooking a stew of oil and copper 
              and lead that precipitated out little platelets that act like tiny 
              mirrors, <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>ically reflecting <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> from a black background. 
              The printing industry is still catching up to the formulation of 
              inks of that sophistication. The same applies to the relatively 
              recent discovery of how optical weak localization helps illuminate 
              a printed page. It's fair to ask that any successor to the book 
              be able to do these things as well.</p>
<p>Drawing on all the resources now at our disposal to catch up to 
              what Gutenberg was doing in the fifteenth century is a worthy challenge. 
              But it's not the real goal; it's an essential warm-up along the 
              path to asking what we can now achieve that Gutenberg could not. 
              Gutenberg did exactly the same thing. He started by printing replicas 
              of illuminated manuscripts; after all, that was where the market 
              was. Then, as printing with movable metal type made it possible 
              to assemble more pages than before, it became necessary to invent 
              page <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>ing and tables of <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s to keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible. 
              These innovations departed from the past practice of manuscripts 
              that were copied by hand, which were designed to minimize length 
              at all costs. There was an interesting transitional period during 
              which hand-illuminated manuscripts added page <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s to keep up 
              with the fashion, before the bother of copying by hand became too 
              hard to justify and quietly disappeared. Freed from the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a> 
              of duplicating manuscripts, Aldus Manutius in Venice around 1500 
              then settled on the dimensions of the modern book. It was designed 
              to fit in the saddlebags of traveling scholars, and his Press developed 
              the italics font, to fill pages more efficiently than did fonts 
              that imitated handwriting.</p>
<p>The arrival of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> books now presents an opportunity to 
              rethink how collections of books are organized into libraries. A 
              library is, of course, much more than a book <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>. It's a reading 
              temple, a place for serendipitous browsing, a <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> to be with books, 
              by yourself and with others. My only literary connection with John 
              Updike is that we have the same favorite part of Harvard's great 
              Widener library&amp;#8212a small depression in the stone floor on the 
              way into the stacks. To gain admittance to the stacks you pass through 
              a gauntlet of dour gatekeepers, climb a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of stairs, turn immediately 
              right, and then left. The generations of readers and writers pivoting 
              at this last corner over the years have worn it down, hollowing 
              out a bowl that provides a connection to everyone who has come before. 
              I can't write like Updike, but when it comes to floor abrasion I'm 
              on an equal footing with him.</p>
<p>Once you're past that corner, the bookshelves appear. I have no 
              idea how far they extend, because it's impossible to pass more than 
              a few aisles without stopping to pick up an interesting title, then 
              wondering about a book next to it, then realizing that you simply 
              must spend more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in that section. The same thing happens with 
              the old card catalog. Drawers holding worn cards that appear to 
              date back to the opening of the building, if not the Civil War, 
              speak volumes about what books are popular and what books are not. 
              Flipping through the cards is even more likely than walking down 
              the aisle to turn a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a> into a branching ramble through 
              accumulated <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, which lasts until dinner or darkness forces 
              an end.</p>
<p>In the noisy battle between the <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> digerati and their <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> 
              enemies, there is a common misconception that the pleasure and <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> 
              of this kind of browsing must be sacrificed if a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is used 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Too much is made of the inadequacies of transitional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, while simultaneously too little is expected of it. An 
              on-line card catalog that reduces each entry to a single screenful 
              of flickering green text is incapable of communicating the popularity 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of a book. That's not a failing of <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s or phosphors; 
              it's a poorly designed <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. The wear and tear of a card catalog, 
              or of a library floor, are consequences of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering decisions 
              about the construction of cards, or floors, or shoes. That those 
              technologies succeed through a combination of intended and unplanned 
              interactions provides valuable guidance for <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> development, 
              but it doesn't mean that they are the only possible solutions.</p>
<p>There are many things that a card catalog, even Widener's, can't 
              do. Of all major U.S. libraries, Widener is the only one that doesn't 
              shelve its books according to the Library of Congress indexing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. 
              This is because Harvard's <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> predates that of the Library of 
              Congress; relabeling and reshelving the millions of volumes would 
              be prohibitive. It's much easier to move the bits associated with 
              the books. Once a card catalog becomes <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>, the presentation 
              can be freed from a single ordering defined with great effort by 
              generations of librarians. Books can be shown by date, or location, 
              or author, or discipline. Browsing need not be confined to books 
              that are nearby in any one index; a smarter card catalog can show 
              books that are related in multiple ways. And the card catalog can 
              help provide <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for the book by showing other books that have 
              been checked out with it, or perhaps a map of where in the world 
              the book is being read then.</p>
<p>Doing these things requires a visual sophistication that was beyond 
              the means of not only early <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s but also their <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers. 
              Letting the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers alone design the card catalog <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> 
              results in a faithful presentation of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> represents 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> internally, rather than how people use it externally. 
              Creating books and libraries requires typographers and architects 
              as well as bookbinders and librarians; the same thing is even more 
              true <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally.</p>
<p>My colleague David Small belongs to a new generation of graphic 
              designers who happen to be fluent <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers. Early fonts were 
              designed to hold ink on the letter forms as well as to help guide 
              the eye; David and his peers are using the interactivity of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              to let letters act and react in ways that are appropriate for the 
              text and the reader. One of my favorite of his design studies presents 
              Shakespeare's works through the medium of a graphical <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> 
              connected to a Lego <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>.</p>
<p>Initially the screen shows a hazy blob that in fact contains all 
              of the words of all of Shakespeare's plays. It's a 3D <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> that 
              you can fly through, so that you can grab the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s control 
              knobs and zoom in to find a play, and approach still closer to find 
              the text of a scene beautifully laid out. Rotating the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> to 
              peek behind the words reveals supporting annotations. Moving within 
              a play and among plays is done by traveling in this <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> rather 
              than by pulling books off of a shelf.</p>
<p>Since most of us don't have much <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with flying through 
              words, David adds some familiar guides. In front of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              is a Lego <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>, with toy characters drawn from Shakespeare's characters 
              and themes. Selecting one of these physical icons highlights the 
              corresponding parts of Shakespeare's corpus on the screen in the 
              background, showing first the large-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s and then the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> words if you move in for a closer look. Spending <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              in this environment invites browsing in a way that can't be done 
              if the texts are frozen on pages. A good book uses a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> exposition 
              to convey a nonlinear web of connections between the author and 
              the reader; David's environment comes much closer than a flat book 
              to representing how I think about a Shakespeare play as I read it.</p>
<p>There's still one more benefit of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> books: <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>. There's 
              an implicitly elitist undercurrent in defending printed books over 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> books. The collection of the Widener library is a treasure 
              that by design very few people will ever get to see, much less use 
              routinely. Before printing, when books were copied by hand, they 
              were so precious that owning one was a sign of great <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>, usually 
              limited to religious orders rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> people. A single 
              book is now so inexpensive that anyone can have one, but private 
              libraries are still owned only by institutions and the <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y. 
              The budgets of most public libraries restrict their collections 
              to a small subset of the wonders of Widener. Creating an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              Widener is a heroic task that, even if done imperfectly, will make 
              much more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> available to many more people. Not everyone 
              can own David Small's <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>, but if the job of a local library 
              becomes one of providing the tools to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> rather 
              than holding the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> itself, then it can do more with less.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> books will be able to do everything that printed books 
              can do, but one. They can't replace the primacy of a historical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>. This is a point that technologists like me frequently 
              miss. Part of the pleasure in seeing a Gutenberg Bible is knowing 
              that Gutenberg held the same <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> that you are looking at, drawing 
              a connection across the centuries between you and him and everyone 
              else who has come in between. A completely faithful replica that 
              matches the specifications can never convey that.</p>
<p>Some <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> simply can't be copied <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly. The rarest of 
              the rare books in Harvard's collection is bound in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> skin. It 
              is a modern witness to an old practice of people leaving a legacy 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of themselves for their successors in the binding of a 
              posthumous book. The unsettling attraction of such a book is that 
              it can never be duplicated.</p>
<p>For people who come to a library to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> the texture and 
              smell and even the pedigree of an old book, there's no point in 
              arguing the merits of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ink. On the other hand, there's 
              no point in limiting everyone else by preserving old packages for 
              timeless <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, the debate about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of books is really about 
              the relative performance of competing technologies. Books are designed 
              by people, as are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. There are plenty of examples of apparently 
              irreconcilable disagreements over a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> disappearing 
              once the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> catches up to the specifications of what it's 
              replacing. Many people used to religiously proclaim that they couldn't 
              edit text on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen; once the resolution of a screen 
              began to approach that of the eye at a comfortable reading distance, 
              the discussion began to go away. Now writing a text by hand is the 
              exception rather than the rule. Such passionate debates get settled 
              not by persuasion, but by technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> making them increasingly 
              irrelevant.</p>
<p>Along the way, the presumptions of a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> must usually 
              be tempered by the <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> embodied in an old one. In the early days 
              of the internal combustion <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> it was interesting to race horses 
              and cars. Now we have supersonic cars, but no one is arguing for 
              the abolition of horses. Although horses are no longer the fastest 
              means of <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>, no current car can recognize its owner 
              with a glance, or choose a path through a narrow mountain pass, 
              or be left in a meadow to refuel itself, or make a copy of itself 
              when it begins to wear out. Cars still have a long way to go to 
              catch up to horses.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that are meant to replace books are destined to be 
              transformed even more by the books. Reading is too varied and personal 
              to be bounded by the distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>. I have 
              some beloved books that I'll never want to browse through in any 
              other form, and piles of books threatening to topple over onto my 
              desk that I'd <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally, and some inscrutable 
              texts that I'll never get anywhere with until they're available 
              with active annotations and on-line connections.</p>
<p>Choosing between books and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s makes as much <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> as choosing
