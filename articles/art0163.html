<div class="TeaserText">In this chapter from The Age of Intelligent Machines (published 1990), Sherry Turkle looks at the cultural implications of artificial intelligence, when computers become mirrors for our identities. How does thinking about machines make us rethink what it means to be human?</div>
<br>
<br><p>The cultural fascination with <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> has two faces. There is excitement about the <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s themselves: their power, their ability to act as extensions of our minds much as the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of earlier generations acted as extensions of our bodies. But also and equally important, there is an involvement with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as mirrors that confront us with ourselves. Here the question is not whether we will ever build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that will think like people but whether people have always <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. And if this is the case, if we are in some important <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> kin to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, is this the most important thing about us? Is this what is most essential about being human?</p>
<p>Such questions have long been the province of philosophers. But in recent years something has changed. Intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have entered the public <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> not just as actors in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>-fiction scenarios but as real objects, objects you can own as well as read about. This has put the philosophical debate in a new place. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> has moved out from the world of the professionals into the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of the larger culture. But unlike the way in which a theory like psychoanalysis was able to move out into the wider culture, the new popular considerations of mind and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> arise from people's actual relationships with an object they can touch and use. New ideas are carried by relationships with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as objects to think with.</p>
<p>A simple example makes the point. Twenty years ago the question of how well <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could play <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> was a subject of controversy for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers and their philosophical interlocutors. Some writers felt that there was no limit to what <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could achieve in this domain. Others responded that there would be absolute limits to the powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. "Real" <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, they argued, was the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> only humans could play, since it called upon powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> that were uniquely rooted in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capacities.</p>
<p>That dialog with the strengths and limitations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> continues within <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, but it has been joined by other, more informal conversations: those of master players who sit across from <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in tournament play, those of recreational <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> players who compete with <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s at home. The <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have gotten very good; <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> players respond by trying to determine what is special about their play, even if they cannot always exploit this specialness to actually beat the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. And of course, the players include the first generation of children who have grown up playing <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. A thirteen-year-old, Alex, plays daily with a <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> named Boris. He comments that although he always loses if he "puts the setting high enough" (that is, if he asks the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to play the best game it can), "it doesn't really feel like I'm losing." Why? Because "<a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> with Boris is like <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> with somebody who is cheating. He can have all the most famous, all the best <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> games right there to look at-I mean, they are inside of him. I can read about them, but I can't remember them all, not every move. I don't know if this is how he works, but it's like in between every move he could read all the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> books in the world." Here, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> uniqueness is defined in terms not of strengths but a certain frailty. "Real" <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> for this child is <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> that works within the boundaries of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> limitations.</p>
<p>Thus, the presence of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the culture provokes a new <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> in everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Its questions are not so different than the ones posed by professionals: If the mind is (at least in some ways) a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, who is the actor? Where is intention when there is <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>? Where is responsibility, <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, soul? In my <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on popular attitudes toward <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> I have found that the answers being proposed are not very different either. Faced with smart objects, both professional and lay philosophers are moved to catalog principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> uniqueness. The professionals find it in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intentionality, embodiment, <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. They find it in the fact that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle confronts each of us with the certainty of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. There are clear echoes of these responses within the larger culture. As children tell it, we are distinguished from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> and affection, by <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual urges and sensual ones, and by the warmth and familiarity of domesticity. In the words of twelve-year-old David, "When there are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s who are just as smart as people, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will do a lot of the jobs, but there will still be things for the people to do. They will run the restaurants, taste the food, and they will be the ones who will <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> each other-have families and <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> each other. I guess they'll still be the ones who go to church."</p>
<p>One popular response to the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s is to define what is most <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> as what <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can't do. But this is a fragile principle when it stands alone, because it leaves one trying to run ahead of what clever <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will come up with next. An increasingly widespread attitude, at least among people who have sustained contact with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, is to admit that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds are some kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and then to find ways to think of themselves as something more as well. When they do so, people's <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s usually turn to their feelings. Some find it sufficient to say, as did David, that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, and people are sensuality and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>. But others split the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capacity for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. They speak of those parts of our <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that can be simulated and those parts that are not subject to simulation.</p>
<p>In all of this, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> plays the role of an evocative object, an object that disturbs equanimity and provokes self reflection. That it should do so for adults is not surprising: after all, intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s strike many of us as childhood <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> that has become real. But I have already suggested that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s also play this role for children. You may give a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to a child hoping that it will teach <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming skills or French verbs. But independent of what the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> teaches the child, it does something else as well. For the child, as for the adult, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is evocative. It creates new occasions for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> through the philosophical questions to which childhood must give a response, among them the question of what is alive.</p>
<p>The Swiss psychologist <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a> first <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atized our understanding of the "child as philosopher." Beginning in the 1920s, Piaget studied children's emerging way of coming to terms with such aspects of the world as causality, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. He discovered that children begin by understanding the world in terms of what they know best: themselves. Why does the ball roll down the slope? "To get to the bottom," says the young child, as though the ball, like the child, had its own desires. But childhood animism, this attribution of the properties of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to inanimate objects, is gradually displaced by new ways of understanding the physical world in terms of physical processes. In <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the child learns that the stone falls because of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>; intentions have nothing to do with it. And so a dichotomy is constructed: physical and psychological properties stand opposed to one another in two great <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. The physical properties are used to understand things; the psychological to understand people and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is a new kind of object, a psychological object. It is a thing ("just a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>"), yet it has something of a mind. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is betwixt and between, an object with no clear place in the sharply dichotomized <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, and as such it provokes new reflection on <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and mind.</p>
<p>Piaget argued that children develop the concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> by making finer and finer distinctions about the kinds of activities that are evidence of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. In particular, Piaget described how the notion of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is built on <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ive refinements of children's concept of physical motion. At age six a child might see a rolling stone, a river, and a bicycle as alive for the same <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>: "They go." By age eight the same child might have learned to make a distinction between movement that an object can generate by itself and movement imposed by an outside <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a>. This allows "alive" to be restricted to things that seem to move of their own accord: a dog, of course, but also perhaps a cloud. An object drops out of the "alive" category when the child discovers an outside force that accounts for its motion. So at eight the river may still be alive, because the child cannot yet understand its motion as coming from outside of itself, but the stone and the bicycle are not alive, because the child can. Finally, the idea of motion from within is refined to a mature concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> activity: <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, metabolism, breathing.</p>
<p>There are two key <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s in the story as Piaget told it. First, children build their theories of what is alive and what is not alive as they build all other theories. They use the things around them: toys, people, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the natural environment. Second, in Piaget's world, children's sorting out the concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> presented a window onto the child's "construction of the physical." <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a> about the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> required the child to develop distinctions about the world of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. The motion theory for distinguishing the living from the nonliving corresponds to the world of "traditional" objects that have always surrounded children: animate objects-people and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s who act and interact on their own-and all the other objects, pretty well inert until given a push from the outside. In recent years there has been an important change. The new class of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects in children's worlds has provoked a new <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> for theory building about the concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>Today children are confronted with highly interactive objects that talk, teach, play, and win. Their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> toys do not move but are relentlessly active in their "mental lives." Children are not always sure about whether these objects are alive, but it is clear to even the youngest children that <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about motion won't take one very far toward settling the question. Children perceive the relevant criteria not as physical or mechanical but as psychological: Are the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s smart? Can they talk? Are they aware? Are they conscious? Do they have feelings? Even, do they cheat? The important question here is not whether children see intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s as alive. Some do, some do not, and, of course, in the end all children learn the "right answer." What is important is the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing the child uses to sort out the question. The child knows that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is "just a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>," but it presents itself with lifelike, psychological properties. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s force the child to think about how <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> minds and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds are different. In this way, the new world of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects becomes a support for what Piaget might have called the child's construction not of the physical but of the psychological.</p>
<p>In the adult world, experts argue about whether or not <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will ever become true <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>s, themselves capable of autonomous, humanlike <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. But irrespective of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects are even now affecting how today's children think. The <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> gives way to the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> when children think about <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and the question of what is alive.</p>
<p>This change in discourse, this new use of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the construction of the psychological, is important for many <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. Here, I mention three that are particularly striking. First, children are led to a new way of talking about the relationship between <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. In Piaget's studies, the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> evolved side by side with the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Generally, when children ascribed <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to inanimate objects, they ascribed <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> too; when <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> became identified with the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> became a property unique to <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. But when today's children reflect on <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects, the pattern is very different. Many children allow intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to be conscious long after they emphatically deny them <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. When one child remarks that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not alive, but it cheats "without knowing it is cheating," he is corrected by another who insists that "knowing is part of cheating." Children talk about the nonliving <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as aware, particularly when it presents itself as "smarter" than they are, for example, in math or spelling or French. They talk about the nonliving <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as having malicious intent when it consistently beats them at games. Adults hold onto the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are not aware as a sign of their fundamental difference from people. But today's children take a different view. The idea of an artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> does not upset them. They find it a very natural thing. They may be the first generation to grow up with such a radical split between the concepts of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, the first generation to grow up believing that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are not necessarily alone as aware <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s. The child's splitting of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is a clear case of where it does not make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to think of adult ideas filtering down to children. Rather, we should think of children's resolutions as prefiguring new positions for the next generation of adults whose psychological culture will be marked by the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture.</p>
<p>Second, children are led to make increasingly nuanced distinctions about the psychological. Younger children from around six to eight sometimes say that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are like people in how they think but unlike people in their origins. ("The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> got smart because people taught it.") But this is not a stable position. It is unsatisfying because it leaves the essential difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and people tied to something that happened in the past, almost as though the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s' minds and the children's minds are alike; they differ only in their parents. Older children reach for a more satisfying way to describe what people share and do not share with the <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. When younger children talk about the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>, they throw together such undifferentiated observations as that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> toy is happy, is smart, cheats, and gets angry. Older children make finer distinctions within the domain of the psychological. In particular, they divide it in two. They comfortably manipulate such ideas as "it thinks, but it doesn't feel." They comfortably talk about the line between the affective and the cognitive.</p>
<p>With the splitting of the psychological, it is no longer the issue of whether something has a <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> or does not. By developing a distinct idea of the cognitive, children find a way to grant to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> which they feel compelled to acknowledge by virtue of what the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s do, while they reserve other aspects of the psychological for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. This response to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of splitting <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> is particularly marked in children who use <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s a great deal at school or at home. Katy, eleven, after a year of experience with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming said, "People can make <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s intelligent: you just have to find about how people think and put it in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>," but <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s are a different <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. For Katy, the kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can do are the kinds that "all people do the same. So you can't give <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s feelings, because everybody has different feelings."</p>
<p>The distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and feeling is not the only line that children draw across mental <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the course of coming to terms with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Discussions about whether <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s cheat can lead to conversations about intentions and awareness. Discussions about the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s limitations can lead to distinctions between <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> as opposed to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming and predetermination. This often brings children to another distinction, the one between rote <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, which <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can do, and originality, which is a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> prerogative. Finally, discussion about how <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s think at all can lead to the distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and mind. All of these are <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of how <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s evoke an increasingly nuanced construction of the psychological.</p>
<p>Finally, children's new psychologized appreciation of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s influences how they articulate what is most special, most important about being a person. While younger children may say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is alive "because it has feelings," older children tend to grant that the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> has <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and is thus "sort of alive" but then distinguish it from people because it lacks feelings. The Aristotelian definition of man as a rational <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> (a powerful definition even for children when it defined people in contrast to their nearest neighbors, the <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s) gives way to a different distinction. Today's children came to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s through a process of identification with them as psychological entities. And they come to see them as our new nearest neighbors. From the point of view of the child, this is a neighbor that seems to share, or even excel in, our rationality. People are still defined in contrast to their nearest neighbors. But now people are special because they feel. The notion of a rational <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> gives way to the paradoxical construction of people as <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>This last point brings me full circle to where I began: with the image of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as evocative objects in the lives of adults. My studies show that many adults follow essentially the same path as do children when they talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings in relation to the new intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. The child's version is to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> is to be <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al. The adult's version is to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> is to be unprogrammable. People who say that they are perfectly comfortable with the idea of mind as <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> assent to the idea that simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> but often cannot bring themselves to propose further that simulated feeling is feeling.</p>
<p>There is a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which both of these reactions, the child's and the adult's, contrast with a prevalent fear that involvement with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> leads to a mechanical view of people. Instead, what I find is something of a romantic reaction. There is a tendency to cede to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> but at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, in defense, to construct a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> that is increasingly focused on the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>On a first hearing, many people find these observations reassuring. But it is important to underscore that there is a disturbing note in this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-provoked reconsideration of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> specificity. <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a> and feeling are inseparable. When they are torn from their complex relationship with each other and improperly defined as mutually exclusive, the cognitive can become mere logical process, and the affective is reduced to the visceral. What was most powerful about Freud's psychological vision was its aspiration to look at <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and feeling as always existing together in interaction with each other. In psychoanalytic <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> there is an effort to explore the passion in the mathematician's proof as well as an effort to use <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> in understanding the most primitive fantasy. The unconscious has its own highly structured <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, which can be deciphered and analyzed. <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> has an affective side, and affect has a <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al models of mind may in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> deepen our appreciation of these complexities. But for the moment, the popular impact of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on our psychological culture goes in the other direction. The too easy acceptance of the idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s closely resemble people in their <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and differ only in their lack of feelings supports a dichotomized and oversimplified view of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>. The effort to think against this trend will be one of our greatest challenges in the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">age of intelligent machines</a>.</p>
