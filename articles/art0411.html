<div class="TeaserText">Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> discusses how robots will think on their feet with the help of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> and other technological advances.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Ray, in your opinion, do you think robots will be an integral part of <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? What kinds of tasks will they handle? And what kind of timeline are we talking about? Five years? Ten years?</p>
<p>RAY: We're already using robot planes for both reconnaissance and actual <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a> launching. Fully autonomous land-based robotic weapons are probably ten years away, but we're close to systems that combine robotic systems with human control via secure <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>.</p>
<p>Surgeons are already performing surgeries on humans from afar using <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> systems that combine full immersion visual <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> with tactile haptic control. In this way the surgeon has controllable visual scaling over size so that small features appear much larger (e.g., the eye can be the size of a basketball). The doctor can also feel the tension when pushing on a blood vessel or tendon. While the doctor is in this immersive environment (reflecting the conditions in the actual remote patient), she is controlling a robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to perform the actual surgery. Thus the robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is effectively a remote extension of the doctor.</p>
<p>Although fully autonomous robotic weapons will ultimately be used, the next generation of remote robotic weapons will work similarly to the remote surgical systems. Why put a human in a tank if a remote human over a secure <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> line works just as well? And if you no longer need to put several 180 pound humans in the tank, then you can make the tank the size of a dog, or ultimately, that of an <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>.</p>
<p>Although the high level intelligent decisions are made by the remote human(s), it is still useful for the tank to have lower levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> for such tasks as navigating rough terrain automatically, climbing stairs (without requiring the human to have to navigate the logistics of each step), and so on.</p>
<p>Over time, these remote systems will become more autonomous as they gain greater sophistication in higher level decision making.</p>
<p>The development project known as "smart dust" is developing <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> sized flying robots that can perform surveillance functions and communicate findings back to satellite collection stations.</p>
<p>2. <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> and the R&amp;D labs its been funding for the past five years has produced a pretty sophisticated breed of something they call Tactical Mobile Robots. Have you had a chance to see any of these in <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>? Do you think the TMRs that are out there now could be used in battle or for reconnaissance in an actual conflict somewhere in the world? How would today's TMRs be used? Or do you think the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> still has a ways to go?</p>
<p>RAY: I'm familiar with the TMR <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. I'm quite familiar with robot development at a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> labs including MIT, and CMU. I have not been given a specific tour of TMR robots.</p>
<p>It is helpful to put <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> into perspective. <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> has played a pivotal role in developing a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of key technologies that have ultimately had important <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> applications. However, that does not mean that the actual devices created through <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> funded <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> are used directly in combat.</p>
<p>For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> funded basic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in speech recognition through the 1980s and 1990s. Today, derivatives of that <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> are used for automated word spotting of intercepted phone messages. Of course, <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> created the Arpanet, the forerunner of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>.</p>
<p>I don't expect the specific devices from the <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> TMR <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to necessarily be used in the next round of <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a>, but they are creating some of the basic technologies that will be applied to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations of practical weapons.</p>
<p>There are already systems that can use binocular and triangular vision systems to create reasonably accurate three-dimensional maps of obstacles.</p>
<p>As I stated above, I think the threshold we are on are collaborative systems of robot weapons with enough <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> for basic navigation and mobility, with remote sensing control by humans. We'll see quite a lot of fully autonomous weapons within a decade.</p>
<p>3. What are a couple of the technological hurdles that researchers face in trying to develop a robot that can "think on its feet" (so to speak) in the heat of battle?</p>
<p>RAY: If human commanders are able to make certain decisions, such as "all humans in this particular area are considered enemies that can be destroyed," then the next generation of robotic systems could detect any moving entities (which would include humans, animals, cars, etc.) and destroy them. Ultimately, if we expect autonomous robotic weapons to demonstrate human levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, we'll have to wait until machines pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> around 2029. But there are obvious advantages to robotic systems in that they can be more daring than a human, have the inherent advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in terms of accuracy, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and speed.</p>
<p>4. Is there any advice you would give to TMR researchers? Are they headed down the right path with the current designs of TMRs? Or are there other/additional avenues of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> that you believe tactical robots should be directed toward?</p>
<p>RAY: The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> includes basic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on such areas as <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> vision, three-dimensional mapping, and automated systems for mobility. These will be useful building blocks for <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations of robots for both <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>, industrial, and even home applications.</p>

People would not be in the line of fire, and thus there would be no holes in a bases defense where a sniper could shoot inside a stronghold.
