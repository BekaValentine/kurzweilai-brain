<div class="TeaserText">Wherever he looks, Raymond Kurzweil sees a pattern. Even if it's steamed lobster.</div>

<br><p>Originally published May 15, 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050227104916/http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,15084,00.html" target="_new">The Standard</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 31, 2001.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/crustacean_entry.html">crustacean</a> was served as an hors d'oeuvre when President Clinton awarded the inventor the <a class="thought" href="entries/national_medal_technology_entry.html">National Medal of Technology</a> in late March. The White House gala honored his innovations in the fields of optical character and <a class="thought" href="entries/voice_recognition_entry.html">voice recognition</a> over the last 25 years. While the other guests indulged without a second <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, Kurzweil saw in the lobster a way to meld <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> into a superspecies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old is far, far out there when it comes to envisioning where computing is headed. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells of a spiny lobster, he points out, can be hooked up to artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, as demonstrated in a recent experiment at the San Diego Institute for Nonlinear <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>. "The <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s accepted their <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> peers," he says, smiling with the confidence of a <a class="thought" href="entries/visionary_entry.html">visionary</a> who is sure that one day we will all become one with our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. In fact, if all goes according to Kurzweil's plan, in 2050 a copy of his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> -- or "mindfile" -- will give interviews like this one from a <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> community keeps coming up with tangible results to support his outlandish claims, from respected labs at MIT and Yale to startups like Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a>s in Chicago and the nano-adventures at Texas-based <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a>. News stories about <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-based computing, next-generation chips grown in petri dishes and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>-size nanorobots built from <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms are in the headlines just as the race to decipher the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is drawing to a close. As high-tech angst spreads, Kurzweil welcomes these advances in his 1999 book, The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>.</p>
<p>Is he disappointed that he received the United States' highest <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> honor for <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development dating back to the 1970s and '80s -- plain-old useful stuff running on people's desks, not in secret labs? Sitting in his pink- and cream-colored office on the outskirts of Boston, Kurzweil shakes his head. "First, I see myself as an inventor," he says over the hiss of two oversize air purifiers. "I enjoy seeing the positive impact <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has on people. My <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> work is an extension of that. It gives me the opportunity to think 20, 30 years out and not be limited. What I describe is not <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, but disciplined <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> futurism."</p>
