<div class="TeaserText">Most viewers of The Matrix consider the more fanciful elements--intelligent computers, downloading information into the human brain, virtual reality indistinguishable from real life--to be fun as science fiction, but quite remote from real life. Most viewers would be wrong. As renowned computer scientist and entrepreneur Ray Kurzweil explains, these elements are very feasible and are quite likely to be a reality within our lifetimes.</div>

<p><i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> </i>is <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in a world one hundred years in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, 
              a world offering a seemingly miraculous array of technological marvels&#8212;sentient 
              (if malevolent) <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, the ability to directly <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> capabilities 
              into the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and the creation of virtual realities indistinguishable 
              from the real world. For most viewers these developments may appear 
              to be pure <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>:interesting to consider, but of little 
              relevance to the world outside the movie theatre. But this view 
              is shortsighted. In my view, these developments will become a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> 
              within the next three to four decades.</p>
<p>I've become a student of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends as an outgrowth of my 
              career as an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>. If you work on creating technologies, you 
              need to anticipate where <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be at points in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              so that your project will be feasible and useful when it's completed, 
              not just when you started. Over the course of a few decades of anticipating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, I've become a student of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends and have 
              developed mathematical models of how technologies in different areas 
              are developing.</p>
<p>This has given me the ability to invent things that use the materials 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, not just limiting my ideas to the resources we have 
              today. <a class="thought" href="entries/kay_entry.html">Alan Kay</a> has noted, "To anticipate the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> we need to 
              invent it." So we can invent with <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> capabilities if we have 
              some idea of what they will be.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant insight that I've gained, which people 
              are quick to agree with but very slow to really internalize and 
              appreciate all of its implications, is the accelerating pace of 
              technical change itself.</p>
<p>One Nobel laureate recently said to me: "There's no way we're going 
              to see self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological entities for at least 
              a hundred years." And yes, that's actually a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able estimate 
              of how much work it will take. It'll take a hundred years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, 
              at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, to get self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological 
              entities. But the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is not going to remain at today's 
              rate; according to my models, it's doubling every decade. </p>
<p>We will make a hundred years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in 25 years. The next ten years will be like twenty, and the following 
              ten years will be like 40. The 21st century will therefore be like 
              20,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>&amp;#8212at today's rate. The twentieth century, 
              as revolutionary as it was, did not have a hundred years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              at today's rate; since we accelerated up to today's rate, it really 
              was about 20 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. The 21st century will be about a 
              thousand times greater, in terms of change and <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>, than 
              the 20th century.</p>
<p>A lot of these trends stem from <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the implications 
              of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> refers to <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s and famously 
              states that the computing power available for a given price will 
              double every twelve to twenty-four months. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> has become 
              a synonym for the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing.</p>
<p>I've been <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> and its <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for at least 
              twenty years. What is the real <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of this <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>? 
              Where does it come from? Is it an example of something deeper and 
              more profound? <i>As I will show, </i>the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of 
              computing goes substantially beyond <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. Indeed, exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> goes beyond just <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, and applies to every area of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that will ultimately reshape 
              our world.</p>
<p>Observers have pointed out that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> is going to come to 
              an end. According to Intel and other industry experts, we'll run 
              out of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> within fifteen years, because 
              the key features will only be a few atoms in width. So will that 
              be the end of the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing?</p>
<p>That's a very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant question as we ponder the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the 
              21st century. To address this question, I put 49 famous <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              on an exponential graph. Down at the lower left hand corner is the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry that was used in the 1890 American census 
              (calculating equipment using <a class="thought" href="entries/punch_card_entry.html">punch card</a>s). In 1940, <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> 
              developed a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> based on telephone relays that cracked the 
              German <a class="thought" href="entries/enigma_code_entry.html">enigma code</a> and gave Winston Churchill a transcription of 
              nearly all the Nazi messages. Churchill needed to use these transcriptions 
              with great discretion, because he realized that using them could 
              tip off the Germans prematurely. </p>
<p>If, for example, he had warned Coventry authorities that their 
              city was going to be bombed, the Germans would have seen the preparations 
              and realized that their <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> had been cracked. However, in the Battle 
              of Britain, the English flyers seemed to magically know where the 
              German flyers were at all times.</p>
<p>In 1952, CBS used a more sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> based on <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> 
              tubes to predict the election of a U.S. president, President Eisenhower. 
              In the upper right-hand corner is the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> sitting on your desk 
              right now. </p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613230306/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart03.jpg"><img border="0" height="295" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613230306im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart03.jpg" width="375"></a></p>
<p>One insight we can see on this chart is that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> was not 
              the first but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of 
              computing power. Each vertical line represents the movement into 
              a different <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>: electro-mechanical, relay-based, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> ran out 
              of steam, another <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> came along and picked up where that <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              left off.</p>
<p>People are very quick to criticize <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s, saying that 
              ultimately they'll run out of resources, like rabbits in Australia. 
              But every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> one particular <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> reached its limits, another, 
              completely different <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> would continue the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. 
              They were making <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s smaller and smaller but finally got 
              to a point where they couldn't make them any smaller and maintain 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>. Then <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s came along, which are not just small 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s. They're a completely different <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>.</p>
<p>Every horizontal level on this graph represents a multiplication 
              of computing power by a factor of a hundred. A straight line in 
              an exponential graph means <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. What we see here 
              is that the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is itself growing exponentially. 
              We doubled the computing power every three years at the beginning 
              of the century, every two years in the middle, and we're now doubling 
              it every year. </p>
<p>It's obvious what the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> will be: computing in three 
              dimensions. After all, we live in a three-dimensional world and 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is organized in three dimensions. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> uses a very 
              inefficient type of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry. <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">Neuron</a>s are very large "<a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s," 
              and they're extremely slow. They use electrochemical signaling that 
              provides only about 200 calculations per second, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> gets 
              its prodigious power from parallel computing resulting from being 
              organized in three dimensions. Three-dimensional computing technologies 
              are beginning to emerge. There's an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> at MIT's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab that has 300 layers of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry. In recent years, there 
              have been substantial strides in developing three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s 
              that operate at the molecular level.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">Nanotubes</a>, which are my favorite, are hexagonal arrays of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> 
              atoms that can be organized to form any type of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>. 
              You can create the equivalent of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s and other electrical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. They're physically very strong, with 50 times the strength 
              of steel. The thermal issues appear to be manageable. A one-inch 
              cube of nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry would be a million times more powerful 
              than the computing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, there has been a sea change in the 
              level of confidence in building three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s and achieving 
              at least the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to emulate <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. This 
              has raised a more <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> issue, namely that "<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> may be 
              true for <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> but it's not true for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>." </p>
<p>From my own four decades of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> development, 
              I believe that is not the case. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> is increasing 
              very rapidly. As an example from one of my own companies, in 15 
              years, we went from a $5,000 speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that recognized 
              a thousand words poorly, without continuous speech, to a $50 product 
              with a hundred-thousand-word vocabulary that's far more accurate. 
              That's typical for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> products. With all of the efforts in 
              new <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> development tools, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> has also been 
              growing exponentially, albeit with a smaller exponent than we see 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Many other technologies are improving exponentially. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              project was started about 15 years ago, skeptics pointed out that 
              at the rate at which we can scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, it will take 10,000 
              years to finish the project. The mainstream view was that there 
              would be improvements, but there was no way that the project could 
              be completed in 15 years. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> and throughput 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> sequencing doubled every year, and the project was completed 
              in less than 15 years. In twelve years, we went from a cost of $10 
              to sequence a <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> base pair to a tenth of a cent.</p>
<p>Even longevity has been improving exponentially. In the 18th century, 
              every year we added a few days to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy. In the 
              19th century, every year, we added a few weeks. We're now adding 
              about 120 days every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy. And with the 
              revolutions now in an early stage in <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a>, therapeutic cloning, 
              rational drug design, and the other <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> transformations, 
              many observers including myself anticipate that within ten years 
              we'll be adding more than a year, every year. So, if you can hang 
              in there for another ten years, we'll get ahead of the power curve 
              and be able to live long enough to see the remarkable century ahead.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">Miniaturization</a> is another very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>. We're 
              making things smaller at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per

<p>Above is a chart of computing's <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, projected into 
              the 21st century. Right now, your typical $1000 <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> is somewhere 
              between an <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> and a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> has about 100 
              billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, with about 1,000 connections from one <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to 
              another. These connections operate very slowly, on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 
              200 calculations per second, but 100 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s times 1,000 
              connections creates 100 trillion-fold parallelism. Multiplying that 
              by 200 calculations per second yields 20 million billion calculations 
              per second, or, in computing terminology, 20 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>. We'll 
              have 20 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> for $1000 by the year 2020.</p>
<p>Now that won't automatically give us <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              because the organization, the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and the embedded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> are equally <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant. Below I will address the scenario 
              in which I envision achieving the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              but I believe it is clear that we will have the requisite computing 
              power. By 2050, $1000 of computing will equal one billion <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              brains. That might be off by a year or two, but the 21st century 
              won't be wanting for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> framework envisioned by 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>&amp;#8212a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> which is indistinguishable from 
              true <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. This will be feasible, but I do quibble with one point. 
              The thick cable entering Neo's brainstem made for a powerful visual, 
              but it's unnecessary; all of these connections can be <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>. 
              Let's go out to 2029 and put together some of the trends that I've 
              discussed. By that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we'll be able to build <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, microscopic-sized 
              robots that can go inside your capillaries and travel through your 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from inside. We can almost build these 
              kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s today. We can't make them quite small enough, 
              but we can make them fairly small. </p>
<p>The Department of Defense is developing tiny robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s called 
              "Smart Dust." The current generation is one millimeter&#8212;that's 
              too big for this scenario&amp;#8212but these tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s can be dropped 
              from a plane, and find positions with great precision. You can have 
              many thousands of these on a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>. They can 
              then take visual images, communicate with each other, coordinate, 
              send messages back, act as nearly invisible spies, and accomplish 
              a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ives.</p>
<p>We are already building blood-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that go inside 
              the blood stream, and there are four major conferences on the topic 
              of "bioMEMS" (<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> Micro <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s). The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s I am envisioning for 2029 will not necessarily require 
              their own navigation. They could move involuntarily through the 
              bloodstream and, as they travel by different neural features, communicate 
              with them the same way that we now communicate with different cells 
              within a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a>-scanning resolution, speeds, and costs are all exploding 
              exponentially. With every new generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning we can 
              see with finer and finer resolution. There's a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> today 
              that allows us to view many of the <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> details of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Of course, there's still no full agreement on what those 
              details are, but we can see <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> features with very high resolution, 
              provided the scanning tip is right next to the features. We can 
              scan a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> today and see the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s activity with very fine detail; 
              you just have to move the scanning tip all throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              so that it's in close proximity to every neural feature.</p>
<p>Now how are we going to do that without making a mess of things? 
              The answer is to send the scanners inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. By design, 
              our capillaries travel by every interneuronal connection, every 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> and every neural feature. We can send billions of these scanning 
              robots, all on a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>, and they would all 
              scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from inside and create a very high-resolution map 
              of everything that's going on.</p>
<p>What are we going to do with the massive <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of neural <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              that develops? One thing we will do is reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              that is, understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> principles of how it works. This is 
              an endeavor we have already started. We already have high resolution 
              scans of certain areas of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not one organ; 
              it's comprised of several hundred specialized regions, each organized 
              differently. We have scanned certain areas of the auditory and visual 
              cortex, and have used this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to design more intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a> at Caltech, for example, has developed powerful, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> chips that are based on these <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly 
              inspired models from the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of portions of the 
              visual and auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. His visual sensing chips are used in 
              high-end <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> cameras.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that we are able to understand these <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, 
              but they're different from the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s that we typically run 
              on our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. They're not sequential and they're not logical; 
              they're chaotic, highly parallel, and self-organizing. They have 
              a holographic <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> in that there's no chief-executive-officer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. You can eliminate any of the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, cut any of the wires, 
              and it makes little difference&#8212;the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and the processes 
              are distributed throughout a complex region.</p>
<p>Based on these insights, we have developed a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly 
              inspired models today. This is the field I work in, using techniques 
              such as <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary "<a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s" and "neural nets," which 
              use <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired models. Today's neural nets are mathematically 
              simplified, but as we get a more powerful understanding of the principles 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of different <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions, we will be in a position 
              to develop much more powerful, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired models. Ultimately 
              we can create and recreate these processes, retaining their inherently 
              massively parallel, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>, chaotic, and self-organizing 
              properties. We will be able to recreate the types of processes that 
              occur in the hundreds of different <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions, and create entities&#8212;they 
              actually won't be in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, they'll probably be using something 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>&#8212;that have the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, richness, and depth 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s today are still a million times simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which is one key <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that they still don't have the endearing 
              qualities of people. They don't yet have our ability to get the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/joke_entry.html">joke</a>, to be funny, to understand people, to respond appropriately 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>, or to have <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s. These are not side 
              effects of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, or distractions; they are the cutting 
              edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. It will require a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to create entities that have those 
              kinds of attractive and convincing features.</p>
<p>Getting back to <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, let's consider a scenario involving 
              a direct connection between the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based 
              implants. There are a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of different technologies that have 
              already been demonstrated for communicating in both directions between 
              the wet, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> world of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. 
              One such <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, called a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, provides this two-way 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. If a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> fires, this <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> detects 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> pulse, so that's <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> from the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. It can also cause the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to fire or prevent 
              it from firing.</p>
<p>For full-immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, we will send billions of these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s to take up positions by every <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> fiber coming from all 
              of our senses. If you want to be in real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, they sit there 
              and do nothing. If you want to be in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they suppress 
              the signals coming from our real senses and replace them with the 
              signals that you would have been receiving if you were in the virtual 
              environment.</p>
<p>In this scenario, we will have <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> from within and 
              it will be able to recreate all of our senses. These will be shared 
              environments, so you can go there with one person or many people. 
              Going to a Web site will mean entering a virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> environment 
              encompassing all of our senses, and not just the five senses, but 
              also <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, sexual pleasure, <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>. There are actually neurological 
              correlates of all of these sensations and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, which I discuss 
              in my book <i>The Age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</i>.</p>
<p>For example, surgeons conducting open-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> surgery on a young 
              woman (while awake) found that stimulating a particular spot in 
              the girl's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> would cause her to laugh. The surgeons <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              that they were just stimulating an involuntary laugh reflex. But 
              they discovered that they were stimulating the <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> of humor: 
              whenever they stimulated this spot, she found everything hilarious. 
              "You guys are just so funny standing there" was a typical remark.</p>
<p>Using these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based implants, you will be able to enhance 
              or modify your <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al responses to different <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s. That 
              can be part of the overlay of these virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> environments. 
              You will also be able to have different bodies for different <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s. 
              Just as people today project their images from Web cams in their 
              apartment, people will beam their whole flow of sensory and even 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s out on the Web, so you can, ' la the plot 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the movie <i>Being John Malkovich</i>, <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> the 
              lives of other people.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will expand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and our 
              abilities and facilities in many different ways. Because they're 
              communicating with each other <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly, they can create new neural 
              connections. These can expand our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, cognitive faculties, and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-recognition abilities. We will expand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              by expanding its current <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of massive interneuronal connections 
              as well as through intimate connection to non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> forms of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>We will also be able to <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, something that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              can do today that we are unable to do. For example, we spent several 
              years training one <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> speech 
              using the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inspired models&#8212;neural nets, Markov 
              models, <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s, self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s&#8212;that are 
              based on our crude current understanding of self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> world. A major part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering project 
              was collecting thousands of hours of speech from different speakers 
              in different dialects and then exposing this to the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and having 
              it try to recognize the speech. It made mistakes, and then we had 
              it adjust automatically, and self-organize to better reflect what 
              it had learned.</p>
<p>Over many months of this kind of training, it made substantial 
              improvements in its ability to recognize speech. Today, if you want 
              your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> to recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> speech, you don't have 
              to spend years training it the same painstaking way, as we need 
              to do with every <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> child. You can just load the evolved models, 
              it's called "loading the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>." So <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can share their 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. We don't have quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports on our brains. 
              But as we build <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>s of our <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, interconnections, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> levels where our skills and memories are stored, 
              we won't leave out the equivalent of <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports. We'll be 
              able to <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> capabilities as easily as Trinity <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>s the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that allows her to fly the B-212 helicopter.</p>
<p>When you talk to somebody in the year 2040, you will be talking 
              to someone who may happen to be of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> origin but whose mental 
              processes are a hybrid of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> processes, 
              working intimately together. Instead of being restricted, as we 
              are today, to a mere hundred trillion connections in our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              we'll be able to expand substantially beyond this level. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is flat; the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race has an estimated 10<sup>26</sup> 
              calculations per second, and that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly determined figure 
              is not going to grow. But <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is growing 
              exponentially. The crossover point, according to my calculations, 
              is in the 2030s; some people call this the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>.</p>
<p>As we get to 2050, the bulk of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>'which in my opinion 
              is still an <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>'will be <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>. 
              I don't believe that the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> scenario of malevolent artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s in mortal conflict with humans is inevitable. At that 
              point, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> portion of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> will still be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, because it's going to be derived from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. 
              Its <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming will be created by humans, or created by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              that are created by humans, or created by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that are based 
              on reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, or one of many other intimate connections between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that we can't even contemplate today.</p>
<p>A common reaction to this is that this is a <a class="thought" href="entries/dystopian_entry.html">dystopian</a> vision, because 
              I am "placing humanity with the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s." But that's because most 
              people have a prejudice against <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Most observers don't truly 
              understand what <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are ultimately capable of, because all 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that they've ever "met" are very limited, compared 
              to people. But that won't be true of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s circa 2030 and 2040. 
              When <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are derived from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and are a million 
              times more capable, we'll have a different respect for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              and there won't be a clear distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We will effectively <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>We are already well down this road. If all the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the 
              world stopped today, our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> would grind to a halt. That 
              wasn't true as recently as thirty years ago. In 2040, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will be deeply and intimately melded. We will 
              become capable of far more profound <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s of many diverse 
              kinds. We'll be able to "recreate the world" according to our <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>s 
              and enter environments as amazing as that of <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a></i>, 
              but, hopefully, a world more open to creative <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> and

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>There is a strong parallel between the concept behind the Matrix and dreaming, particularly lucid dreaming - where the dreamer is aware he or she is dreaming while dreaming. The parallel of course is the experience of a separate reality. I expect the experience of full-immersion in a virtual reality to be very similar to the experience of lucid dreaming. But what will be the consequence of being able to move between all these different realities?
<br>
<br>
It will make people - or intelligent machines - wonder how real our so-called reality actually is. In the end it will become clear that the only thing that persists in all of these realities is consciousness itself, not the world, not even you as a person, but undefined consciousness itself.
<br>
<br>
We will find our home is consciousness, not any one of the realities we'll experience. Of course, this can be realized even now, but experiencing a multitude of seperate realities will put all realites in a new, more dream-like perspective. Consciousness will naturally emerge as the "really real" because it's the only common ground in all realities.
<br>
<br>
So, by all means, take the red pill!

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>1. What's the difference between Morpheus and Agent Smith? 
<br>
<br>
Suppose you are Neo and you have heard both Morpheus and Agent Smith make eloquent speeches about how they see the world, about their reasons, about their feelings. Based on that you have to answer a fundamental question, that is: Who is real? Who is conscious? 
<br>
Morpheus? Agent Smith? Both? None? 
<br>
All you can say is that you know that you are conscious and that's all. You cannot say the same about other people. You see them, you smell them, you touch them, and you talk to them. They talk back to you and it seems they react as conscious beings would do. But how can you be sure? How can another person prove to you that he/she really exists as a being having emotions and volitions? 
<br>
If in a hardware or software simulation of a human being, words and gestures are produced by lines of programmed software, a similar process occur when you dream. In your dreams there are other people with whom you interact and they appear as conscious as the persons in real life but it's only your brain simulating them. So where is the difference? If you cannot tell a machine simulating conscience from a real conscious machine, if you cannot tell a dreamed person from the real one, then how can you judge what conscience is in the first place? 
<br>
<br>
2. What's the difference between Zion and The Matrix? 
<br>
<br>
Suppose that you are Neo again. You are sound asleep and you are dreaming. While you dream the dreamscape is what is real, maybe the sun is shining and you feel the summer breeze. It seems real. The images of persons that populate the dreamscape are like real persons. They interact with you as expected, they get angry if you annoy them, they even laugh at your jokes. Well everything seems coherent. Maybe deep inside you feel that this reality is not solid enough, that there must be something else, but then you reject the whole idea as nonsense' 
<br>
Suddenly you awake and perceive with sadness or relief that what you tough was reality was just another dream. 
<br>
So now you are in the real world and must do the things real people do: brush your teeth, eat your cereal and crawl to your boring workplace, right? Not today. Today events will occur that will end with you taking a red pill and... 
<br>
Suddenly you awake and perceive in excruciating agony that what you tough was reality was nothing more than a massive computer simulation. 
<br>
Hey, but now is for real! Now you know what The Matrix is: It's the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Exactly, so how can you tell when the blindfold has been removed? 
<br>
You where fooled by your brain dreaming reality, then you where fooled by an electronic brain simulating reality. Now, how can you be sure that you are not been fooled by this cool dressed man named Morpheus. Where it all ends? 
<br>
If you accept that a particular reality is a dream or a simulation, what stops you from accepting that the world in which this reality is being simulated is not another simulation. 
<br>
It cannot be that The Matrix is not but an insignificant part of realities inside realities? 
<br>
'you dream that a computer simulates that you dream a dream'

Your question is how one can judge what conscience - being conscious - is in the first place. The article by David Chalmers on this website, "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness", takes the first steps in laying down a framework for judging whether something or someone is a conscious entity. Mr. Chalmers basically says that we may not be able to prove consciousness, but that there is a possibility that we might understand the requirements for "subjective experience". I can see his point and I think his approach to this problem is very promising.
<br>
<br>
When you say "All you can say is that you know that you are conscious and that's all.", I think this is not correct. All I can say is that there is consciousness. In this consciousness different realities appear, exist, and dissapear. In this consciousness different "me's" appear, exist, and dissapear. It seems to me that this unmovable consciousness is much, much more fundamental than any human being or intelligent machine could ever be.
<br>
<br>
I do not think that consciousness emerges from within the human being, rather, the human being and all of these realities that we are talking about emerge from consciousness! But David Chalmers is right in that there are requirements for "subjective experience". For example, if I stop eating and drinking, pretty soon the subjective experience of "Timothy" will disappear. Consciousness however, does not disappear as should be clear from the fact that many people have died in your lifetime, yet you are still conscious!
<br>
<br>
In response to 2:
<br>
<br>
As I said in the post you replied to, none of the realities we will ever experience is ultimately real. This was what I was trying to convey. Neither Zion nor The Matrix is ultimately real. Consciousness will be understood as the "really real", as the ultimate reality. For no reality can exist without consciousness. If there was no awareness whatsoever, then in what way would reality exist? Consciousness is the background, the in-ground of any so-called reality.

When dreaming, experiences are not arising from physical stimulus. If all sensorial input to a conscious being ceases, subjective experience would just fade away? Or will this conscious being create a virtual reality of it's own and continue experiencing? Will it create an entire universe of it's own complete with physical laws and logic and internal coherence? If this can be, then it could be said that a reality exists only because there is a consciousness willing to experience it.
<br>
In this way, the world has not been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. You created the world. Indeed there is not even You, not in the normal sense. The notion of You as an entity separated from the 'others' does not make sense in this context. There is, as you say it, only this unmovable consciousness. There are no separate realities and consciousness. 
<br>
There is only You.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The question of how and when subjective experience arises from the physical is beginning to be answered by science, the question of why may or may not be of a different order. It's possible that we discover that experience simply has to arise from the physical in order for the physical to exist. Subjective experience could be a Quantum Mechanical imperative: without subjective experience no physical universe.
<br>
<br>
When you say "a conscious being" you continue and seem to mean consciousness itself. Consciousness itself however is not "a being", is not divided into seperate "consciousnesses". Spiritual traditions may have called it "The Supreme Being", or "the Creator". But consciousness is impersonal, has no will of its own and therefor the universe is a natural and spontanuous thing, rather than the result of a willfull act of creating.
<br>
<br>
If you did not mean consciousness itself but an entity that has a level of complexity and sophistication that results in subjective experience then it's just a question of whether the conditions for subjective experience are fulfilled or not, and not a question of "a consciousness willing to experience" something.
<br>
<br>
You say: "When dreaming, experiences are not arising from physical stimulus." This may be true but dreams do arise from some physical process in the brain. In other words, the subjective experience still has a physiological basis.
<br>
<br>
Your last comment: "But like in a dream you just don't remember.", is not necessarily true: in a dream there is the possibility of being aware that you are dreaming - as I pointed out in my first post in this thread. And it is just as possible to realize that you are really this undefined, unmovable, boundless and placeless consciousness: that's when you discover the reality beyond "the Matrix", beyond experience. In Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta this is called Realization, Self-Realization or Enlightenment. This may not be a very common phenomenon but has nevertheless occured many times throughout human history.

I am initiated in himalayan yoga by a teacher who has passed on at 95 and I have taken peyote with the Native American Church in Sante Fe, New Mexico in 1966. So the linkage between consciousness and the ego is an interesting one and as far as spirituality an important nexus. Jung, the man who invented the term archetypal played with the concept of mass consciousness and man's symbols. So as in the Matrix where there is a battle of ego, some defining super-ego and the ego-less hive mentality [in this case represented by the adversary] the journey of the individual 'soul' to join the ocean of the 'supreme consciousness or being' is a question I have asked also. One perplexing and difficult situation for the individual in my mind is: When am I not myself and the feeling of loss of self. Sleep is 'the little death' and we enter into it not only to dream but repair the physical body and perhaps more balancing of functions I am not defining. The old vedic expression 'this is not the real body' may be more on target than we can even know. </p></td>

Just as nearly all Hollywood aliens are ugly (they are, after all the villains and we have to hate them to enjoy killing them) and most heros are good looking (by Hollywood standards) we have to take into account the purpose of the depiction -- to scare and thus give a thrill to the filmgoer.  It's a mild substitute for a drug addiction.  We love the chemicals of emotion that rush through our veins when we see certain things that look dangerous.  And it's why we pay big bucks to visit Disneyland and Magic Mountain.  We need our emotional fix and we're willing to pay for it.

Although I am very closely following the improvements and breathroughs in technologies of our time, and for one would love to see the future described in the article, I am also terrified of the possibilities that humans as a whole could do wrong with it.  A world where tiny robots have the ability to control our 5 senses have the ability to, in a both practical and ironical sense, shut us down.  I am not going to discuss the possibilities that certain groups of extremists might do with these technologies, as we hear these scenarios from our government on a daily basis in the United States. (As of 9-11)  This technology might also have the power to effectively destroy the social structure that we live by today.  Here is one scenario;  Suppose a company needs highly intelligent scientists to work on the anti-gravity airplane that it has started working on.  The company, instead of hiring a graduate from MIT and paying him/her 200 thousand dollars annually might instead hire a bum off the streets, implement nanobots into the individual's brain, and upload the information necessary for him to begin his work.  This would effectively lead to the collapse of Universities, as students will no longer need to go to college to recieve the education necessary to become a scientists, or a professional in any field for that matter.  In a sense, everybody would be capable of getting the job done, but not enough jobs to go around.  This would also give a ton of power to the Government, corporate businesses, and so on.  I hope that this scenario will never become reality, but we can never stop ourselves from wondering what the possibilities of such technologies could lead us to in the future.  </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"Fear" in itself is a very ancient animalistic reaction to chemicals which govern our current bodies and brains. The potential of a world where nanobots invade and eventually replace our bloodstreams gives us the potential to alter our bodies from the inside out. So much more will be possible if we aren't haunted by these old and outdated emotions which no longer have any purpose. Our bodies could be rebuilt to live without water or food or even oxygen, and perhaps to be able to withstand being in space or even travel at great speeds. 
<br>
<br>
What you fail to realize in your prediction of the collapse of our current way of life is that a completely new way of life will be born. Universities are a band-aid, a bridge trying to gap our animal instincts with our evolving human brains. They already do not have a purpose, as most people which attend school are only seeking to recieve a piece of paper which will give them a job in a cubicle and have their life fade into oblivion. The true essence of LEARNING has long been forgotten, save for a few places on earth like MIT. 
<br>
<br>
A world where we no longer have to wait a decade to learn something so simple as medical science gives us the possibility, nay, the opportunity to leave behind this rotting flesh and bone and advance to true quantum way of life. Bums and cops and governments and corporations will become extinct and completely irrelevant. To me, this is an inspiring notion. Not a frightening one.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have decided there are 2 possible explanations of what "reality" is right now.
<br>
<br>
1. This is reality... the first and only timeline for humans. The human race will never make it passed a few decades from now before we make time travel and other major acomplishments, because, you see, if we "had" made it we would be getting time travelers back to here in this time right now. That would mean that this splits #1 in half... well accually like 1,000,000,000 (prolly infinite) peices because of the never ending timeline. Therefor humans must have traveled back this this time many many times because all of the timelines inhead of us.
<br>
Going back to the point of #1 we wont make it to the timeline point. I dont know how the entire human race can be destroyed though... unless the machines totaly wipe us out or our entire planet gets destroyed... so my guess would be the AI that form.
<br>
<br>
2. We are in the matrix as of now because since there has noone been time traveld back to us right now. In the matrix the machines will reset the matrix or change it, without us ever knowing it because of our consiousness only  operates at a certain speed. I have a website that describes in everyway that the matrix can and quite possible that even relate to our physics. Our wold is made up of a super computer and everything is programed and binary code is what is under the electron size. It writes everything that is to be done telling everything its job and place. Out side of the matrix could be our one and only timeline, waitting to be destroyed or already destroyed from the AI that we created. Or that could also be a matrix... never ending. Its not hard to relize that that is probably what will happen when we create AI... it will be like creating an unstable supersmart advancing enemy just waiting to destroy us. so outside of our matrix the world IS accually scorched by storms and there is no sunlight... Undoubtedly what we would do if we knew they ran on solar power right? Anyway, what would be there power? why not use your enemy to take advantage of? There arnt many other sources of power that are reproducing that the machines could use without any natural resources left. So they  grow humans and use their brain impulses and all of the other things that produce energy in our body... so we have to live to make this energy. Therefore the machines put us in a matrix. For us to live our lives "living". Our brains are hooked up to their supercomputer that they wrote and have most power over it.Then the last humans get ahold of the technology and understand how to move in and out of the matrix, maybey trying to sabotage the machines from inside out. Also since the matrix is a program and computer, couldnt they very well make the past and future? Just implant memories and stuff. I think in the matrix everything is fate unless you know about it and you can make choices... just like the movie. They probably wouldnt have all of those nueral impants and such, because by that time the AI will probably allready have started their attack. So there still probably is even a rod in your head?
<br>
<br>
 In all i think the possiblity of us in the matrix is about an 80 percent chance. Most of you would probably dissagree strongly and prolly think im crazy but go ahead. Your not the one doing everything in they're power to find a way out, and get unplugged. Therefor as of now, i am dedicating my life to getting out, and understanding all of this. But who knows? i could give up and admit im a moron in a few days or months. Im searching.... and in my opinion the matrix is mad-possible so beleive waht you want. The idea from the movie might have been sparked from somthing, or maybey the humans interfereing with the machines and telling us to create it... for us to relize what is happening. Or i could be wrong and our planet is going to blow up in a few decades? Post replies please.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hmm....I have a different question. I don't mean to be too doubting, but when I first read the predictions on this site, I become very excited and relieved. I'm 18 years old: so if what's here claimed is true, as long as I live a safe and healthy life, barring some unforeseeable and unlikely accident within the next 30 or 40 years, I need not fear death, basically ever. Well, once again, I would dearly love to believe that, but I have to ask of Ray Kurzweil himself, or anyone else who might know the answer: exactly what is he basing all this on? Where are studies or concrete, scientifically-proven citations to back these predictions up? I really don't mean to be hostile or overly-zealous, but If I'm seriously going to believe these things (not that everything about this site doesn't indicate to me that he is a very well-respected and reputable theorist), I would like to see actual studies or concrete data that shows yes, these things really will be possible by or close to the projected timeframes.</p></td>

As he indicates in the article, inorder to be a sucsessful inventor, one must look into the future. If not, your invention will be outdated before it's completed. 
<br>
<br>
The Average Life span has doubled in the last 150 years. With the impending biotech boom, we might be able to double the average life span within the next 75 years, and that's a conservative estimate. Reasearchers have doubled the lifespans of fruit flies, by minipulating the genes, which reduces the amount of calories that can be absorbed by the fruit flies cells. The same holds true for humans, those with a low caloric intake, outlive those with a higher caloric intake. So it's only a matter of time until these gene therapies are available for humans.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ray Kurzweil's prediction of computing power growing double exponentially does not seem far fetched, but what does is his lax prognostication of the Matrix style virtual-reality.  The availability of this magnitude of computing power does not directly imply that software can also be created to have the capability of simulating such a complex virtual reality.  A virtual experience of this complexity would require software that is capable of consistently triggering millions of simulated brain signals to the user's brain.  This in itself is an extremely difficult task.  Albeit that high resolution maps of the biochemical signaling system of the human brain will be available but the extent of how various mechanisms of the brain work in parallel is hardly known.  It may take many more decades after we achieve this caliber of computing power before the true nature of the brain is fully understood.  
<br>
<br>
Even after there is a sufficient understanding of the brain, this knowledge will need to be modeled into a computer simulation of the brain.  As of present, all current models attempt to approximate the total complexity of brain.  The design of software that is capable of mimicking and not approximating the complexity of the brain will require an extraordinarily advanced software model.  It is not to say that this type of model will be out of reach in the future, but developing software of this complexity will take quite a bit of time.  When software becomes this complex, imagine how difficult it would be to locate a simple software bug.
<br>
<br>
A Matrix style virtual-reality also raises questions about whether or not this type of technology will still be legal in the future.  Let's take human cloning for example.  Human cloning is a technology with the potential to clone humans but it has been made illegal in most of the world because it has not proven to be medically safe or scientifically sound.  During the development of this brain stimulating technology, what if the software works incorrectly due to a bug or miscalculation and causes the user permanent brain damage?  There is also the possibility that virtual realities could be created which are so horrific or disturbing that they psychologically damage an individual.  These issues can easily lead to legislation against the further growth of this technology.
<br>
<br>
Cheers.
