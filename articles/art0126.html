<br><h1>Foreward by <i><a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a></i></h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/drexler_entry.html">K. Eric Drexler</a>'s <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i> is an enormously original book about the consequences of new technologies. It is ambitious and imaginative and, best of all, the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is technically sound.</p>
<p>&#160;But how can anyone predict where <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will take us? Although many scientists and technologists have tried to do this, isn't it curious that the most successful attempts were those of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> writers like Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, Frederik Pohl, Robert Heinlein, <a class="thought" href="entries/asimov_entry.html">Isaac Asimov</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/clarke_entry.html">Arthur C. Clarke</a>? Granted, some of those writers knew a great deal about the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of their times. But perhaps the strongest source of their success was that they were equally concerned with the pressures and choices they imagined emerging from their societies. For, as Clarke himself has emphasized, it is virtually impossible to predict the details of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies for more than perhaps half a century ahead. For one thing, it is virtually impossible to predict in detail which alternatives will become technically feasible over any longer interval of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Why? Simply because if one could see ahead <i>that clearly</i>, one could probably accomplish those things in much less <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> - given the will to do so. A second problem is that it is equally hard to guess the character of the social changes likely to intervene. Given such uncertainty, looking ahead is like building a very tall and slender tower of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. And we all know that such constructions are untrustworthy.</p>
<p>&#160;How could one build a sounder case? First, the foundations must be very firm - and Drexler has built on the soundest areas of present-day technical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Next, one must support each important conclusion step in several different ways, before one starts the next. This is because no single <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> can be robust enough to stand before so many unknowns. Accordingly, Drexler gives us multiple supports for each important argument. Finally, it is never entirely safe to trust one's own judgments in such <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s, since all of us have wishes and fears which bias how we think - without our knowing it. But, unlike most iconoclasts, Drexler has for many years courageously and openly exposed these ideas to both the most conservative skeptics and the most wishful-<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> dreamers among serious scientific communities like the one around MIT. He has always listened carefully to what the others said, and sometimes changed his views accordingly.</p>
<p>&#160;<i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i> begins with the insight that what we can do depends on what we can build. This leads to a careful analysis of possible ways to stack atoms. Then Drexler asks, "What could we build with those <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-stacking mechanisms?" For one thing, we could manufacture assembly <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s much smaller even than living cells, and make materials stronger and lighter than any available today. Hence, better spacecraft. Hence, tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can travel along capillaries to enter and repair living cells. Hence, the ability to heal disease, reverse the ravages of age, or make our bodies speedier or stronger than before. And we could make <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s down to the size of viruses, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that would work at speeds which none of us can yet appreciate. And then, once we learned how to do it, we would have the option of assembling these myriads of tiny parts into intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, perhaps based on the use of trillions of nanoscopic parallel-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s which make descriptions, compare them to recorded patterns, and then exploit the memories of all their previous experiments. Thus those new technologies could change not merely the materials and means we use to shape our physical environment, but also the activities we would then be able to pursue inside whichever kind of world we make.</p>
<p>&#160;Now, if we return to <a class="thought" href="entries/clarke_entry.html">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s problem of predicting more than fifty years ahead, we see that the topics Drexler treats make this seem almost moot. For once that <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-stacking process starts, then "only fifty years" could bring more change than all that had come about since near-medieval times. For, it seems to me, in spite of all we hear about modern technological revolutions, they really haven t made such large differences in our lives over the past half century. Did television really change our world? Surely less than radio did, and even less than the telephone did. What about airplanes? They merely reduced travel times from days to hours - whereas the railroad and automobile had already made a larger change by shortening those travel times from weeks to days! But <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i> sets us on the threshold of genuinely significant changes; <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> could have more effect on our material existence than those last two great <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s in that domain - the replacement of sticks and stones by metals and cements and the harnessing of electricity. Similarly, we can compare the possible effects of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> on how we think - and on how we might come to think about ourselves - with only two earlier <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s: those of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and of writing.</p>
<p>&#160;We'll soon have to face some of these prospects and options. How should we proceed to deal with them? <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i> explains how these new alternatives could be directed toward many of our most vital <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> concerns: toward wealth or poverty, health or sickness, peace or war. And Drexler offers no mere neutral catalog of possibilities, but a multitude of ideas and proposals for how one might start to evaluate them. <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i> is the best attempt so far to prepare us to think of what we might become, should we persist in making new technologies.</p>

<p>COAL AND DIAMONDS, sand and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and healthy tissue: throughout <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, variations in the arrangement of atoms have distinguished the cheap from the cherished, the diseased from the healthy. Arranged one way, atoms make up soil, air, and water; arranged another, they make up ripe strawberries. Arranged one way, they make up homes and fresh air; arranged another, they make up ash and smoke.</p>
<p>&#160;Our ability to arrange atoms lies at the foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. We have come far in our <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> arranging, from chipping flint for arrowheads to machining aluminum for spaceships. We take pride in our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, with our lifesaving drugs and desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Yet our spacecraft are still crude, our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are still stupid, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in our tissues still slide into disorder, first destroying health, then <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> itself. For all our advances in arranging atoms, we still use primitive methods. With our present <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we are still forced to handle atoms in unruly herds.</p>
<p>&#160;But the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> leave plenty of room for <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, and the pressures of world competition are even now pushing us forward. For better or for worse, the greatest technological breakthrough in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is still to come.</p><h1>Two Styles Of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a></h1><p>Our modern <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> builds on an ancient tradition. Thirty thousand years ago, chipping flint was the high <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the day. Our ancestors grasped stones containing trillions of trillions of atoms and removed chips containing billions of trillions of atoms to make their axheads; they made fine work with skills difficult to imitate today. They also made patterns on <a class="thought" href="entries/cave_entry.html">cave</a> walls in France with sprayed paint, using their hands as stencils. Later they made pots by baking clay, then bronze by cooking rocks. They shaped bronze by pounding it. They made iron, then steel, and shaped it by heating, pounding, and removing chips.</p>
<p>&#160;We now cook up pure ceramics and stronger steels, but we still shape them by pounding, chipping, and so forth. We cook up pure <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, saw it into slices, and make patterns on its surface using tiny stencils and sprays of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. We call the products "chips" and we consider them exquisitely small, at least in comparison to axheads.</p>
<p>&#160;Our microelectronic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has managed to stuff <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s as powerful as the room-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s of the early 1950s onto a few <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chips in a pocket-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers are now making ever smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, slinging herds of atoms at a crystal surface to build up wires and <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s one tenth the width of a fine hair.</p>
<p>&#160;These microcircuits may be small by the standards of flint chippers, but each <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> still holds trillions of atoms, and so-called "<a class="thought" href="entries/microcomputer_entry.html">microcomputer</a>s" are still visible to the naked eye. By the standards of a newer, more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> they will seem gargantuan.</p>
<p>&#160;The ancient style of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that led from flint chips to <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chips handles atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in bulk; call it <i>bulk</i> <i><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></i>. The new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will handle individual atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s with control and precision; call it <i>molecular</i> <i><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></i>. It will change our world in more ways than we can imagine.</p>
<p>&#160;<i>Micro</i><a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s have parts measured in <i>micro</i>meters - that is, in millionths of a meter - but <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are measured in <i>nano</i>meters (a thousand times smaller). We can use the terms "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>" and "molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>" interchangeably to describe the new style of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will build both nanocircuits and nanomachines.</p><h1>Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Today</h1><p>One dictionary definition of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is "any <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, usually of rigid bodies, formed and connected to alter, transmit, and direct applied forces in a predetermined manner to accomplish a specific objective, such as the performance of useful work." Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s fit this definition quite well.</p>
<p>&#160;To imagine these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, one must first picture <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. We can picture atoms as beads and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s as clumps of beads, like a child's beads linked by snaps. In fact, chemists do sometimes visualize <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s by building models from plastic beads (some of which link in several directions, like the hubs in a Tinkertoy <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>). Atoms are rounded like beads, and although molecular bonds are not snaps, our picture at least captures the essential notion that bonds can be broken and reformed.</p>
<p>&#160;If an <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> were the size of a small marble, a fairly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> would be the size of your fist. This makes a useful mental image, but atoms are really about 1/10,000 the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> are about 1/10,000 the size of mosquitoes. (An atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, however, is about 1/100,000 the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> itself; the difference between an <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> and its <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> is the difference between a fire and a nuclear reaction.)</p>
<p>&#160;The things around us act as they do because of the way their <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s behave. Air holds neither its shape nor its volume because its <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s move freely, bumping and ricocheting through open <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s stick together as they move about, so water holds a constant volume as it changes shape. Copper holds its shape because its atoms stick together in regular patterns; we can bend it and hammer it because its atoms can slip over one another while remaining bound together. Glass shatters when we hammer it because its atoms separate before they slip. Rubber consists of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of kinked <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, like a tangle of springs. When stretched and released, its <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s straighten and then coil again. These simple molecular patterns make up passive substances. More complex patterns make up the active nanomachines of living cells.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists already work with these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, which are chiefly made of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, the main <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering material of living cells. These molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have relatively few atoms, and so they have lumpy surfaces, like objects made by gluing together a handful of small marbles. Also, many pairs of atoms are linked by bonds that can bend or rotate, and so <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are unusually flexible. But like all <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, they have parts of different shapes and sizes that do useful work. All <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s use clumps of atoms as parts. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s simply use very small clumps.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of designing and building such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, but there are difficulties to be overcome. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers use beams of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> to project patterns onto <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chips, but chemists must build much more indirectly than that. When they combine <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in various sequences, they have only limited control over how the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s join. When biochemists need complex molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, they still have to borrow them from cells. Nevertheless, advanced molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will eventually let them build nanocircuits and nanomachines as easily and directly as <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers now build microcircuits or washing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Then <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> will become swift and dramatic.</p>
<p>&#160;Genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers are already showing the way. Ordinarily, when chemists make molecular chains - called "polymers" - they dump <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s into a vessel where they bump and snap together haphazardly in a liquid. The resulting chains have varying lengths, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are strung together in no particular <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;But in modern gene <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers build more orderly polymers - specific <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s - by combining <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. These <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> (the letters of the genetic alphabet) and genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers don't dump them all in together. Instead, they direct the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to add different <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s in a particular sequence to spell out a particular message. They first bond one kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> to the chain ends, then wash away the leftover material and add chemicals to prepare the chain ends to bond the next <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>. They grow chains as they bond on <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s, one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, in a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med sequence. They anchor the very first <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a> in each chain to a solid surface to keep the chain from washing away with its chemical bathwater. In this way, they have a big clumsy <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in a cabinet assemble specific molecular structures from parts a hundred million times smaller than itself.</p>
<p>&#160;But this blind assembly process accidentally omits <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s from some chains. The likelihood of mistakes grows as chains grow longer. Like workers discarding bad parts before assembling a car, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers reduce errors by discarding bad chains. Then, to join these short chains into working genes (typically thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s long), they turn to molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s found in <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;These <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, called restriction enzymes, "read" certain <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> sequences as "cut here." They read these genetic patterns by touch, by sticking to them, and they cut the chain by rearranging a few atoms. Other enzymes splice pieces together, reading matching parts as "glue here" - likewise "reading" chains by selective stickiness and splicing chains by rearranging a few atoms. By using gene <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to write, and restriction enzymes to cut and paste, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers can write and edit whatever <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> messages they choose.</p>
<p>&#160;But by itself, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> is a fairly worthless <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. It is neither strong like Kevlar, nor colorful like a dye, nor active like an enzyme, yet it has something that industry is prepared to spend millions of dollars to use: the ability to direct molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s called ribosomes. In cells, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s first transcribe <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, copying its <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to make <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> "tapes." Then, much as old numerically controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s shape metal based on instructions stored on tape, ribosomes build <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s based on instructions stored on <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> strands. And <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s are useful.</p>
<p>&#160;Proteins, like <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, resemble strings of lumpy beads. But unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s fold up to form small objects able to do things. Some are enzymes, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that build up and tear down <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s (and copy <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, transcribe it, and build other <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s in the cycle of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>). Other <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s are hormones, binding to yet other <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s to signal cells to change their behavior. Genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers can produce these objects cheaply by directing the cheap and efficient molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry inside living organisms to do the work. Whereas <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers running a chemical plant must work with vats of reacting chemicals (which often misarrange atoms and make noxious byproducts), <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers working with <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> can make them absorb chemicals, carefully rearrange the atoms, and store a product or release it into the fluid around them.</p>
<p>&#160;Genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have now <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> to make <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s ranging from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> hormone to rennin, an enzyme used in making cheese. The <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> company Eli Lilly (Indianapolis) is now marketing Humulin, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> insulin <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s made by <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>.</p><h1>Existing <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</h1><p>These <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> hormones and enzymes selectively stick to other <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. An enzyme changes its target's structure, then moves on; a hormone affects its target's behavior only so long as both remain stuck together. Enzymes and hormones can be described in mechanical terms, but their behavior is more often described in chemical terms.</p>
<p>&#160;But other <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s serve <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> mechanical functions. Some push and pull, some act as cords or struts, and parts of some <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s make excellent bearings. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of muscle, for instance, has gangs of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s that reach, grab a "rope" (also made of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>), pull it, then reach out again for a fresh grip; whenever you move, you use these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/amoeba_entry.html">Amoeba</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells move and change shape by using fibers and rods that act as molecular muscles and bones. A reversible, variable-speed motor drives <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> through water by turning a corkscrew-shaped propeller. If a hobbyist could build tiny cars around such motors, several billions of billions would fit in a pocket, and 150-lane freeways could be built through your finest capillaries.</p>
<p>&#160;Simple molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s combine to form <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s resembling industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. In the 1950s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers developed <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools that cut metal under the control of a punched paper tape. A century and a half earlier, Joseph-Marie Jacquard had built a loom that wove complex patterns under the control of a chain of punched cards. Yet over three billion years before Jacquard, cells had developed the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of the ribosome. Ribosomes are proof that nanomachines built of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> can be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to build complex <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Then consider viruses. One kind, the T4 phage, acts like a spring-loaded syringe and looks like something out of an industrial parts catalog. It can stick to a bacterium, punch a hole, and inject viral <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> (yes, even <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> suffer infections). Like a conqueror seizing factories to build more tanks, this <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> then directs the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to build more viral <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and syringes. Like all organisms, these viruses exist because they are fairly stable and are good at getting copies of themselves made.</p>
<p>&#160;Whether in cells or not, nanomachines obey the universal laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Ordinary chemical bonds hold their atoms together, and ordinary chemical reactions (guided by other nanomachines) assemble them. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s can even join to form <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s without special help, driven only by thermal agitation and chemical forces. By mixing viral <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s (and the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> they serve) in a test tube, molecular biologists have assembled working T4 viruses. This ability is surprising: imagine putting automotive parts in a large box, shaking it, and finding an assembled car when you look inside! Yet the T4 <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> is but one of many self-assembling structures. Molecular biologists have taken the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of the ribosome apart into over fifty separate <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, and then combined them in test tubes to form working ribosomes again.</p>
<p>&#160;To see how this happens, imagine different T4 <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> chains floating around in water. Each kind folds up to form a lump with distinctive bumps and hollows, covered by distinctive patterns of oiliness, wetness, and electric charge. Picture them wandering and tumbling, jostled by the thermal vibrations of the surrounding water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. From <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> two bounce together, then bounce apart. Sometimes, though, two bounce together and fit, bumps in hollows, with sticky patches matching; they then pull together and stick. In this way <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> adds to <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> to make sections of the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, and sections assemble to form the whole.</p>
<p>&#160;Protein <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will not need nanoarms and nanohands to assemble complex nanomachines. Still, tiny manipulators will be useful and they will be built. Just as today's <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry as complex as player pianos and <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> arms from ordinary motors, bearings, and moving parts, so tomorrow's biochemists will be able to use <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s as motors, bearings, and moving parts to build <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> arms which will themselves be able to handle individual <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p><h1>Designing With <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a></h1><p>How far off is such an ability? Steps have been taken, but much work remains to be done. Biochemists have already mapped the structures of many <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. With gene <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to help write <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> tapes, they can direct cells to build any <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> they can design. But they still don't know how to design chains that will fold up to make <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s of the right shape and function. The forces that fold <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s are weak, and the number of plausible ways a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> might fold is astronomical, so designing a large <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> from scratch isn't easy.</p>
<p>&#160;The forces that stick <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s together to form complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are the same ones that fold the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> chains in the first place. The differing shapes and kinds of stickiness of amino acids - the lumpy molecular "beads" forming <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> chains - make each <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> chain fold up in a specific way to form an object of a particular shape. Biochemists have learned rules that suggest how an amino acid chain might fold, but the rules aren't very firm. Trying to predict how a chain will fold is like trying to work a jigsaw puzzle, but a puzzle with no pattern printed on its pieces to show when the fit is correct, and with pieces that seem to fit together about as well (or as badly) in many different ways, all but one of them wrong. False starts could consume many lifetimes, and a correct answer might not even be recognized. Biochemists using the best <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s now available still cannot predict how a long, natural <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> chain will actually fold, and some of them have despaired of designing <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s soon.</p>
<p>&#160;Yet most biochemists work as scientists, not as <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers. They work at predicting how natural <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s will fold, not at <i>designing</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s that will fold predictably. These tasks may sound similar, but they differ greatly: the first is a scientific challenge, the second is an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering challenge. Why should natural <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s fold in a way that scientists will find easy to predict? All that <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> requires is that they in fact fold correctly, not that they fold in a way obvious to people.</p>
<p>&#160;Proteins <i>could</i> be designed from the start with the goal of making their folding more predictable. Carl Pabo, writing in the journal <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a>, has suggested a design strategy based on this insight, and some biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have designed and built short chains of a few dozen pieces that fold and nestle onto the surfaces of other <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s as planned. They have designed from scratch a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> with properties like those of melittin, a toxin in bee venom. They have modified existing enzymes, changing their behaviors in predictable ways. Our understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s is growing daily.</p>
<p>&#160;In 1959, according to biologist Garrett Hardin, some geneticists called genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering impossible; today, it is an industry. Biochemistry and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-aided design are now exploding fields, and as Frederick Blattner wrote in the journal <i><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i>, "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s have already reached the level below the grand master. Perhaps the solution to the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-folding problem is nearer than we think." William Rastetter of Genentech, writing in <i>Applied Biochemistry and</i> <i><a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a></i> asks, "How far off is <i>de novo</i> enzyme design and <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>? Ten, fifteen years?" He answers, "Perhaps not that long."</p>
<p>&#160;Forrest Carter of the U.S. Naval <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Laboratory, Ari Aviram and Philip Seiden of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, Kevin Ulmer of Genex Corporation, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers in university and industrial laboratories around the globe have already begun theoretical work and experiments aimed at developing molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, and other structures that could be incorporated into a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. The U.S. Naval <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Laboratory has held two international workshops on molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, and a meeting sponsored by the U.S. National <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Foundation has recommended support for <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> aimed at developing <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s. Japan has reportedly begun a multimillion-dollar <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> aimed at developing self-assembling molecular motors and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/vlsi_entry.html">VLSI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Inc., of San Jose, reports that "It looks like the race to bio-chips [another term for molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s] has already started. NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, Matsushita, Fujitsu, Sanyo-Denki and Sharp have commenced full-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> efforts on bio-chips for bio-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s."</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists have other <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s to want to learn the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> design. New enzymes promise to perform dirty, expensive chemical processes more cheaply and cleanly, and <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s will offer a whole new spectrum of tools to biotechnologists. We are already on the road to <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and as Kevin Ulmer notes in the quote from <i><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> that heads this chapter, this road leads "toward a more general capability for molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering which would allow us to structure <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>."</p><h1>Second-Generation <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a></h1><p>Despite its versatility, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> has shortcomings as an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering material. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s quit when dried, freeze when chilled, and cook when heated. We do not build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of flesh, hair, and gelatin; over the centuries, we have learned to use our hands of flesh and bone to build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of wood, ceramic, steel, and plastic. We will do likewise in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. We will use <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to build nanomachines of tougher stuff than <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;As <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> moves beyond reliance on <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, it will grow more ordinary from an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er's point of view. <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">Molecule</a>s will be assembled like the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of an erector <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>, and well-bonded parts will stay put. Just as ordinary tools can build ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s from parts, so molecular tools will bond <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s together to make tiny gears, motors, levers, and casings, and assemble them to make complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Parts containing only a few atoms will be lumpy, but <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers can work with lumpy parts if they have smooth bearings to support them. Conveniently enough, some bonds between atoms make fine bearings; a part can be mounted by means of a single chemical bond that will let it turn freely and smoothly. Since a bearing can be made using only two atoms (and since moving parts need have only a few atoms), nanomachines can indeed have mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of molecular size.</p>
<p>&#160;How will these better <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s be built? Over the years, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have used <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to improve <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. They have used metal tools to shape metal into better tools, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to design and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> better <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. They will likewise use <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> nanomachines to build better nanomachines. Enzymes show the way: they assemble large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s by "grabbing" small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from the water around them, then holding them together so that a bond forms. Enzymes assemble <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, fats, hormones, and chlorophyll in this way - indeed, virtually the whole range of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s found in living things.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, then, will construct new enzymes to assemble new patterns of atoms. For example, they might make an enzyme-like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> which will add <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms to a small spot, layer on layer. If bonded correctly, the atoms will build up to form a fine, flexible diamond fiber having over fifty times as much strength as the same weight of aluminum. Aerospace companies will line up to buy such fibers by the ton to make advanced composites. (This shows one small <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> competition will drive molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forward, as it has driven so many fields in the past.)</p>
<p>&#160;But the great advance will come when <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are able to make structures more complex than mere fibers. These <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will resemble ribosomes <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med by <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, or the older generation of automated <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med by punched tapes. They will open a new world of possibilities, letting <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers escape the limitations of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s to build rugged, compact <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with straightforward designs.</p>
<p>&#160;Engineered <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s will split and join <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s as enzymes do. Existing <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s bind a variety of smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, using them as chemical tools; newly <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s will use all these tools and more.</p>
<p>&#160;Further, organic chemists have shown that chemical reactions can produce remarkable results even without nanomachines to guide the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. Chemists have no direct control over the tumbling motions of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in a liquid, and so the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are free to react in any way they can, depending on how they bump together. Yet chemists nonetheless coax reacting <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to form regular structures such as cubic and dodecahedral <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, and to form unlikely-seeming structures such as molecular rings with highly strained bonds. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will have still greater versatility in bondmaking, because they can use similar molecular motions to make bonds, but can guide these motions in ways that chemists cannot.</p>
<p>&#160;Indeed, because chemists cannot yet direct molecular motions, they can seldom assemble complex <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s according to specific plans. The largest <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s they can make with specific, complex patterns are all linear chains. Chemists form these patterns (as in gene <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s) by adding <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in sequence, one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, to a growing chain. With only one possible bonding site per chain, they can be sure to add the next piece in the right place.</p>
<p>&#160;But if a rounded, lumpy <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> has (say) a hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> atoms on its surface, how can chemists split off just one <i>particular</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> (the one five up and three across from the bump on the front) to add something in its place? Stirring simple chemicals together will seldom do the job, because small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s can seldom select specific places to react with a large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. But <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be more choosy.</p>
<p>&#160;A flexible, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will grasp a large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> (the workpiece) while bringing a small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> up against it in just the right place. Like an enzyme, it will then bond the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s together. By bonding <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> after <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> to the workpiece, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will assemble a larger and larger structure while keeping complete control of how its atoms are arranged. This is the key ability that chemists have lacked.</p>
<p>&#160;Like ribosomes, such nanomachines can work under the direction of molecular tapes. Unlike ribosomes, they will handle a wide variety of small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s (not just amino acids) and will join them to the workpiece anywhere desired, not just to the end of a chain. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will thus combine the splitting and joining abilities of enzymes with the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mability of ribosomes. But whereas ribosomes can build only the loose folds of a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, these <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will build small, solid objects of metal, ceramic, or diamond - invisibly small, but rugged.</p>
<p>&#160;Where our fingers of flesh are likely to bruise or burn, we turn to steel tongs. Where <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are likely to crush or disintegrate, we will turn to nanomachines made of tougher stuff.</p><h1>Universal <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>s</h1><p>These second-generation nanomachines - built of more than just <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s - will do all that <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s can do, and more. In particular, some will serve as improved <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s for assembling molecular structures. Able to tolerate acid or <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, freezing or baking, depending on design, enzyme-like second-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to use as "tools" almost any of the reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s used by chemists - but they will wield them with the precision of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. They will be able to bond atoms together in virtually any stable pattern, adding a few at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to the surface of a workpiece until a complex structure is complete. Think of such nanomachines as <i><a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s</i>.</p>
<p>&#160;Because <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will let us place atoms in almost any <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able arrangement (as discussed in the Notes), they will let us build almost anything that the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> allow to exist. In particular, they will let us build almost anything we can design - including more <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s. The consequences of this will be profound, because our crude tools have let us explore only a small part of the range of possibilities that natural law permits. <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>s will open a world of new technologies.</p>
<p>&#160;Advances in the technologies of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, and production - and <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a> - all depend on our ability to arrange atoms. With <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, we will be able to remake our world or destroy it. So at this point it seems wise to step back and look at the prospect as clearly as we can, so we can be sure that <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> are not a mere futurological mirage.</p><h1>Nailing Down Conclusions</h1><p>In everything I have been describing, I have stuck closely to the demonstrated facts of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. Still, people regularly raise certain questions rooted in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. These deserve more direct answers.</p>
<p>&#160;<i>Will the <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a> of quantum</i> <i><a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a></i> <i>make molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s unworkable?</i>
</p>
<p>&#160;This principle states (among other things) that <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s can't be pinned down in an exact location for any length of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. It limits what molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can do, just as it limits what anything else can do. Nonetheless, calculations show that the <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a> places few important limits on how well atoms can be held in place, at least for the purposes outlined here. The <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a> makes <i><a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a></i> positions quite fuzzy, and in fact this fuzziness determines the very size and structure of atoms. An <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> as a whole, however, has a comparatively definite position <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> by its comparatively massive <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>. If atoms didn't stay put fairly well, <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s would not exist. One needn't study <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> to trust these conclusions, because molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> demonstrate that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s work.</p>
<p>&#160;Will the molecular vibrations of heat make molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s unworkable or too unreliable for use?</p>
<p>&#160;Thermal vibrations will cause greater problems than will the <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a>, yet here again existing molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s directly demonstrate that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can work at ordinary temperatures. Despite thermal vibrations, the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry in some cells makes less than one error in 100,000,000,000 operations. To achieve this accuracy, however, cells use <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (such as the enzyme <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> polymerase I) that proofread the copy and correct errors. <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>s may well need similar error-checking and error-correcting abilities, if they are to produce reliable results.</p>
<p>&#160;Will radiation disrupt molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and render them unusable?</p>
<p>&#160;High-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> radiation can break chemical bonds and disrupt molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Living cells once again show that solutions exist: they operate for years by repairing and replacing radiation-damaged parts. Because individual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are so tiny, however, they present small targets for radiation and are seldom hit. Still, if a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of nanomachines must be reliable, then it will have to tolerate a certain amount of damage, and damaged parts must regularly be repaired or replaced. This approach to reliability is well known to designers of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>
<p>&#160; <i>Since</i> <i><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a></i> <i>has failed to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, does this show that they are either impossible or useless?</i>
</p>
<p>&#160;The earlier questions were answered in part by pointing to the working molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of cells. This makes a simple and powerful case that natural law permits small clusters of atoms to behave as controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, able to build other nanomachines. Yet despite their <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> resemblance to ribosomes, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will differ from anything found in cells; the things they do - while consisting of ordinary molecular motions and reactions - will have <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> results. No <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, for example, makes diamond fiber.</p>
<p>&#160;The idea that new kinds of nanomachinery will bring new, useful abilities may seem startling: in all its billions of years of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has never abandoned its <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> reliance on <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Does this suggest that improvements are impossible, though? <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>es through small changes, and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> <i>of</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> cannot easily <i>replace</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>/ribosome <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is specialized to make <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has had no real opportunity to evolve an alternative. Any production manager can well appreciate the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s; even more than a factory, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cannot afford to shut down to replace its old <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Improved molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry should no more surprise us than alloy steel being ten times stronger than bone, or copper wires transmitting signals a million times faster than nerves. Cars outspeed cheetahs, jets outfly falcons, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s already outcalculate head-scratching humans. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will bring further examples of improvements on <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, of which second-generation nanomachines will be but one.</p>
<p>&#160;In physical terms, it is clear enough why advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will be able to do more than existing <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. They will be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable like ribosomes, but they will be able to use a wider range of tools than all the enzymes in a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> put together. Because they will be made of materials far more strong, stiff, and stable than <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, they will be able to exert greater forces, move with greater precision, and endure harsher conditions. Like an industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> arm - but unlike anything in a living <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> - they will be able to rotate and move <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in three dimensions under <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med control, making possible the precise assembly of complex objects. These advantages will enable them to assemble a far wider range of molecular structures than living cells have done.</p>
<p>&#160;Is there some special magic about <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, essential to making molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry work?</p>
<p>&#160;One might doubt that artificial nanomachines could even equal the abilities of nanomachines in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, if there were <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to think that cells contained some special magic that makes them work. This idea is called "vitalism." Biologists have abandoned it because they have found chemical and physical explanations for every aspect of living cells yet studied, including their motion, <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, and reproduction. Indeed, this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is the very foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Nanomachines floating in sterile test tubes, free of cells, have been made to perform all the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> sorts of activities that they perform inside living cells. Starting with chemicals that can be made from smoggy air, biochemists have built working <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s without help from cells. R. B. Merrifield, for example, used chemical techniques to assemble simple amino acids to make bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, an enzymatic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that disassembles <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is special in structure, in behavior, and in what it feels like from the inside to be alive, yet the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that govern the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> also govern the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>&#160; The case for the feasibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and other nanomachines may sound firm, but why not just wait and see whether they can be developed?</p>
<p>&#160;Sheer curiosity seems <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> enough to examine the possibilities opened by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, but there are stronger <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. These developments will sweep the world within ten to fifty years - that is, within the expected lifetimes of ourselves or our families. What is more, the conclusions of the following chapters suggest that a wait-and-see policy would be very expensive - that it would cost many millions of lives, and perhaps end <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Is the case for the feasibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s firm enough that they should be taken seriously? It seems so, because the heart of the case rests on two well-established facts of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. These are (1) that existing molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s serve a range of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> functions, and (2) that parts serving these <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> functions can be combined to build complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Since chemical reactions can bond atoms together in diverse ways, and since molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can direct chemical reactions according to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med instructions, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s definitely are feasible.</p><h1>Nanocomputers</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>s will bring one breakthrough of obvious and <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> importance: <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will use them to shrink the size and cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s and speed their operation by enormous factors.</p>
<p>&#160;With today's bulk <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers make patterns on <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chips by throwing atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s at them, but the patterns remain flat and molecular-scale flaws are unavoidable. With <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, however, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will build <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s in three dimensions, and build to atomic precision. The exact limits of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> today remain uncertain because the quantum behavior of <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s in complex <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of tiny structures presents complex problems, some of them resulting directly from the <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a>. Whatever the limits are, though, they will be reached with the help of <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;The fastest <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will use <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> effects, but the smallest may not. This may seem odd, yet the essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> has nothing to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. A <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is a collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es able to turn one another on and off. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es start in one pattern (perhaps representing 2 + 2), then <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> one another into a new pattern (representing 4), and so on. Such patterns can represent almost anything. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers build <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s from tiny electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es connected by wires simply because mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es connected by rods or strings would be big, slow, unreliable, and expensive, today.</p>
<p>&#160;The idea of a purely mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is scarcely new. In England during the mid-1800s, <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a> invented a mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> built of brass gears; his co-worker Augusta Ada, the Countess of Lovelace, invented <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming. Babbage's endless redesigning of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, problems with accurate manufacturing, and opposition from budget-watching critics (some doubting the usefulness of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s!), combined to prevent its completion.</p>
<p>&#160;In this tradition, Danny Hillis and Brian Silverman of the MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory built a special-purpose mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> able to play tic-tac-toe. Yards on a side, full of rotating shafts and movable frames that represent the state of the board and the strategy of the game, it now stands in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Museum in Boston. It looks much like a large ball-and-stick molecular model, for it is built of Tinkertoys.</p>
<p>&#160;Brass gears and Tinkertoys make for big, slow <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. With <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s a few atoms wide, though, a simple mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would fit within 1/100 of a cubic micron, many billions of times more compact than today's so-called <a class="thought" href="entries/microelectronics_entry.html">microelectronics</a>. Even with a billion bytes of storage, a nanomechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could fit in a box a micron wide, about the size of a bacterium. And it would be fast. Although mechanical signals move about 100,000 times slower than the electrical signals in today's <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, they will need to travel only 1/1,000,000 as far, and thus will face less delay. So a mere mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will work faster than the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> whirl-winds of today.</p>
<p>&#160;<i><a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a></i> nanocomputers will likely be thousands of times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/microcomputer_entry.html">microcomputer</a>s - perhaps hundreds of thousands of times faster, if a scheme proposed by Nobel Prize-winning physicist <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> works out. Increased speed through decreased size is an old story in <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s.</p><h1>Disassemblers</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">Molecular computer</a>s will control molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, providing the swift flow of instructions needed to direct the placement of vast numbers of atoms. Nanocomputers with molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will also store <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> generated by a process that is the opposite of assembly.</p>
<p>&#160;Assemblers will help <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers synthesize things; their relatives, disassemblers, will help scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers analyze things. The case for <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s rests on the ability of enzymes and chemical reactions to form bonds, and of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to control the process. The case for disassemblers rests on the ability of enzymes and chemical reactions to break bonds, and of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to control the process. Enzymes, acids, oxidizers, alkali metals, ions, and reactive groups of atoms called free radicals - all can break bonds and remove groups of atoms. Because nothing is absolutely immune to corrosion, it seems that molecular tools will be able to take anything apart, a few atoms at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. What is more, a nanomachine could (at need or convenience) apply mechanical force as well, in effect prying groups of atoms free.</p>
<p>&#160;A nanomachine able to do this, while recording what it removes layer by layer, is a <i>disassembler</i>. <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>s, disassemblers, and nanocomputers will work together. For example, a nanocomputer <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will be able to direct the disassembly of an object, record its structure, and then direct the assembly of perfect copies, And this gives some hint of the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p><h1>The World Made New</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>s will take years to emerge, but their emergence seems almost inevitable: Though the path to <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s has many steps, each step will bring the next in reach, and each will bring immediate rewards. The first steps have already been taken, under the names of "genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>." Other paths to <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s seem possible. Barring worldwide destruction or worldwide controls, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race will continue whether we wish it or not. And as advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-aided design speed the development of molecular tools, the advance toward <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will quicken.</p>
<p>&#160;To have any hope of understanding our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, we must understand the consequences of <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, disassemblers, and nanocomputers. They promise to bring changes as profound as the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s, and nuclear weapons all rolled up in one massive breakthrough. To understand a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of such profound change, it makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to seek principles of change that have survived the greatest upheavals of the past. They will prove a useful guide.</p>
