<p>Updates in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, biomolecular and physiological modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> cloning and <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> technologies, and developments in synthetic tissue and organs, <a class="thought" href="entries/bioinformatics_entry.html">bioinformatics</a> and related computing, IT resources, and an ever more diverse range of interrelated technologies are forging the progenitors of an ultimate example of convergence as a process, as a business and economic model, and as a socioeconomic <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of a transglobal, unparalleled, and absolutely irreversible transformative <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>At stake, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and bio-economy <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.</p>
<p>As defined in <i>Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary</i>, convergence is "1) the act, fact, or condition of converging, 2) in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, the formation of similarities in unrelated organisms living in the same environment."</p>
<p>Convergence, a word which has become ubiquitous throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">internet</a>, and IT (<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>) industries, is perhaps one of the most frequently used, but perhaps, misdirected terms of the modern era.</p><h1>Near-term Major Outcome "Marker Points"</h1><p>Global economic indices of valuation, by which the major sovereign nation states and trading cartel entities--which have been correlated with primary commodity assets such as <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>, IT (<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>) resources and infrastructure--are in a stage of transition, toward the next global standard of valuation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, entirely new classes of synthetically contrived organisms, which would not evolve under "natural" circumstances, can be conjured up as <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-sequence codes, mapped onto a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, and cloned out on demand.</p>
<p>Enter the era of artificially enhanced <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, synthetic organisms, genetically derived and targeted pharmacopia, cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">cybernetics</a>, intracellular "corrective <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>" <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> on demand, as a commodity resource.</p><h1>Seminal Marker Points--An <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary Eventstream</h1><p>Now, at the edge of the next millennium, quasi-viral <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s do indeed exist, in the form of modified viral hybrid "entities" designed to precisely target <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> types based on their external <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> signature. This is an extraordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, not the least of the applications being the potential ability to genetically target cells, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells, in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to arrest their <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>. Another application is to deliver proteomic compounds to cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s within the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> of a living <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> (such as ribosomes or <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a>) as a method for treating, or rather, "correcting" the <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>ic affects of disease and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> exposure events or to kill the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>.</p>
<p>This <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> exists today, as a patented process developed by Onyx <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> (Richmond, CA), and has been engaged in a development <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> with Lawrence Livermore Lab.</p>
<p>Onyx is not alone in such pursuits, however. Just over a year ago, at the Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> - <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> Applications and <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">Novel</a> Approaches (San Diego) conference, I met with Dr. Stephen Lee, the director of the nanobiological molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s group from Monsanto, who was chairing the conference. The Monsanto approach, to specifically target <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> types via their external <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> signature, is to utilize spherical "assemblies" of a type of pseudo-<a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> like molecular material, referred to as dendrimers, to facilitate this process.</p>
<p>Unlike the quasi-viral <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> approach, in which these "molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s" are self replicating, the Monsanto-developed dendrimer molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s are static, inert. Both approaches have their advantages and shortcomings, but the core concept is the same: target a specific <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> type, and only that <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> type, enter the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> via enzymic <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, enter the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, and instigate some form of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> activity.</p><h1>The Emergent <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> Age--Fundamental Considerations</h1><p>Previous, recent "ages" of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and economic development, with substantial and irreversible social and cultural influences, such as the "Computing Age" (subsequently evolving into the "<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Age," driven by the combination of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">internet</a>, and ubiquitously <a class="thought" href="entries/distributed_computing_entry.html">distributed computing</a> capacity), are only the minimal progenitors of what is about to emerge, "the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> Age," the first stage progenitor of which is the phenomenon of <a class="thought" href="entries/bioconvergence_entry.html">bioconvergence</a>.</p>
<p>What is about to transpire is the rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> into an era where health care, the very definition of "<a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>," or for that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, even <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> itself as it is currently understood to be, is in a state of transition. This phenomenon is directly in parallel with extraordinary changes in agricultural processes, bio-resource management, and ultimately, the de facto equivalent of <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> entire ecosystems.</p>
<p>The stakes are enormous. The actual scale of economic implications rivals any "<a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a>" of previous eras and the outcome is likely to affect virtually every sovereign nation state, geographical region, and their associated population bases, whether or not they are direct participants in this transitional process.</p>
<p>The closest <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, in terms of geopolitical and economic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s influence, might be appropriately compared to the conceptual model of "petrodollars," as in the global petroleum resource base functioning as an implied currency reference.</p>
<p>It may become the case, at some point in the not too distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, that "biotech-dollars," as a metaphorical reference of valuation, will begin to drive the major economies of the world, and influence geopolitical and social policy imperatives.</p>
<p>Randy Scott, founder of Incyte Inc., proclaimed at the recent "Seizing Opportunities in Emerging BioChips Technologies" conference (March 19 - 20, 1998, San Francisco) that "<a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>." This was no idle statement, though the significance of what was implied may have only been apparent to the select audience in attendance at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>Barely a year later, by every standard of measure that may be effectively used to analyze such phenomena, an inescapable truth is indeed emerging: an extraordinary revolution is at hand, driven by the urge of necessity, and spectacular economic opportunity potential.</p>
<p>The "<a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>" is already unfolding and the primary <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary eventstream<b> </b>that are poised to reshape the economies of the world, and perhaps even the very definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> itself, are currently at hand.</p><h1>Five Primary Vectors of <a class="thought" href="entries/bioconvergence_entry.html">Bioconvergence</a></h1><p>1) <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">Genome</a> Mapping: Genopharmacopia, Recombinant Proteomics</p>

<p>Particularly in the arenas of immunoassay, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> diagnostics and genetic sequencing applications, the ability to automate high throughput laboratory procedures, which previously were extremely <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> consuming, labor intensive, and less accurate, has immediate, extraordinarily lucrative implications in a host of <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> and biomedical applications.</p>
<p>Healthcare is shifting toward an arena of applied "<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic mapping," providing preventive medical strategies, patient-specific therapies, the genetic targeting of disease and pathologies.</p>
<p>Agriculture is shifting ever more toward an arena of bioengineered plants, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, and entire multi-functional "contained ecologies." These key phenomena are already taking place, and the world's major economic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s practitioners, industry analysts, and political policy makers are beginning to orient themselves to the emergent "<a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> epicenter" driven global economy.</p><h1>The Emergent Convergence Syndrome</h1><p>My primary focus has been (and continues to be) on providing <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to realms of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> development and emergent economic phenomena, which are evolving into an "operational <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>" from which are being spawned a series of societal and cultural transformations, incomparable in scale, <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>, to any previous eras of known <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> itself is even being compressed into shorter useful lifetime cycle <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, and scale are surpassing <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> decision rendering capacity, particularly under duress in ever diminishing timescales. We are entering into a realm where mission-critical decision rendering exceeds <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> decision-rendering capacity in this operational <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>.</p><h1>Virtual Commodity Assets</h1><p>There is currently an emergent "virtual commodity asset" based economic <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>, in which the primary indices of valuation are transitioning toward the brokering of processes, and the inception of <a class="thought" href="entries/ubiquitous_computing_entry.html">ubiquitous computing</a> and telecommunication infrastructures, as an emergent "operational <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>," populated with <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, genetic and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a>s, hierarchical autonomous <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> "colonies" and societal <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> and non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and its myriad variant applications already in advanced stages of development in many cases, are the material <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s of this operational <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> is not a singular niche <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> or arena of potential commercial interest. It is a concept, a transformative threshold that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> is about to encounter on a truly <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary scale. Incremental marker points of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> development have been recorded throughout the span of recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, as reference coordinates by which the scale, <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of such <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary development can be measured.</p>
<p>Compression is now occurring, however, in both temporal and functional domains. The incremental partitioning of major transitional thresholds which may have at one point been measured in terms of millennia, then centuries, and more recently, in decades, is now compressing down <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> spans of a few years, and perhaps in the near term, increments of months and weeks.</p>
<p>Proportional with an acceleration of temporal compression is an acceleration of functional <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, or what I refer to here as the "convergence syndrome." As a process, events, technologies, belief <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, cultural and societal <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s, even the very definitions of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> itself, are becoming ever more interconnected and interdependent on a global scale. In this newly emerging domain, nothing is isolated or autonomous.</p>
<p>As vector coordinates on an enormous existence <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>, in which all forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> "here" (as it is currently interpreted to be), and in parallel domains, any perturbations within this <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> cause a <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> front to be propagated throughout this <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>, eventually affecting all of the other nodes embedded within.</p>
<p>All activities and process dynamics have effects and counter effects, just as can be witnessed in the most fundamental rules of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> in the observable <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, but these now being translated upon the populations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, and indeed, the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> itself.</p>
<p>The interstitial graticule spacing of this existence <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>, or what might be referred to here as mesh granularity, is compressing as well, in direct proportion with the temporal compression and functional <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> factors. Indeed, this proportional increase in mesh granularity of the existence <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> can be visualized as an topological index of trend status and plotted as such, as an <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a> of this process.</p>
<p>The acceleration vectors indicated by this composite of interacting dynamic factors in this existence <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> may be in a state of flux as to the precise rate of increase inherent in these indicators, but the trend topologies to be recognized in this <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>, and their associated rates of acceleration, do tend to suggest a culmination into a vertical vector, a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> "convergence point" threshold boundary.</p>
<p>At this point, the critical mass of existence as it is currently understood will be extruded through a series of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary "test" increments, each one of which representing an increase of amplitude in functional <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, and a compression in temporal partitioning, greater than the increment preceding it.</p>
<p>The outcome of this rapid succession of test increments, threshold boundaries to be encountered and negotiated, will determine whether we continue to the next great increment of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process, as an experiment on this particular world at this particular moment in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, or simply go into failure mode, perhaps to re-evolve to some new <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> form <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> countless millennia from now.</p>
<p>In terms of galactic, and indeed universal scale, this is not unusual at all, or even particularly significant. We are but a speck of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, very much like a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of plankton adrift in the sea of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Other worlds and their respective <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms and ecosystems have evolved to levels of incremental development far beyond what can be currently witnessed here, and many others have no doubt lapsed into complete failure mode in far more relatively primitive stages of development.</p>
<p>What is significant, however, is that from the perspective of being here on this world, at this moment, is that never before in the known <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of this world and its current inhabitants have the threshold of transition by which the very <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of this current world are about to be determined and measured within the reach of its current inhabitants.</p>
<p>Current processes by which the current <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> support capacity of the biosphere may be suppressed into eventual <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> level failure mode:</p>
<p>1) Predatory manufacturing and industrial processes</p>
<p>2) Acceleration in consumption of non-renewable resources</p>
<p>2) Irreversible alterations to ecosystems, soil, oceans, atmosphere</p>
<p>3) Increased dispensation of hazardous materials, <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s, mutagens</p>
<p>4) Situational dysfunction of societies, socio-economic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s</p>
<p>5) Hard asset-based commodity <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s decaying into irrecoverable debt vorticesResources and processes currently existing, or in various stages of development: 1) "Manufactured" synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms, pseudomorphs, quasi-organic entities. 2) Materialization of "virtual assets" via applied <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. 3) Cybernetic and genetic modification of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body. 4) Synthetic sentience as a strategic resource. 5) Infinitely scalable <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resource</p>

I am glad that Charles wrote this article as he brings ideas from many different fields together. Unfortunately, I think many futurists have backgrounds in areas like computing, materials science or mathematics. This leads them to look at the world through their glasses which often are not colored with biology. At the same time, many biologists don't seem to make very big predications of the future. Most just make very conservative predictions like we will have whole genome testing in the doctoors office. 
<br>
<br>
So it is refreshing to hear Charles speak of a Bioconvergence which I feel is under represented in much of the literature. Convergence is of course very relevant, as the internet formed from convergence of computers &amp; telecommunications. In nature, often the richest areas are at the interface of 2 ecosystems, like the seashore or the edge of a forest. 
<br>
<br>
In reality, even if the internet gains conscience it wont matter much until the rubber hits the road in terms of physically interacting with the world. This interaction may happen with machines, but more likely will happen with some human or biological interface.
<br>
<br>
I was at a nanotech conference a few years ago &amp; noted that much of the nano stuff that they were trying to build from the ground up already existed in nature (think mitochondria, flagellar motors, Hydrogen ion pumps etc) The reality is that when biotech meets robotics, computers and other technologies, then amazing things may happen. 
<br>
<br>
One thing I don't agree with is Randy Scotts quote that "protein is software". I think DNA is software, and Protein is hardware. 
<br>
<br>
A style comment: Charles should win some award for long winded sentences.
