<div class="TeaserText">An illustration of the <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a> written for "The Futurecast," a monthly column in the Library Journal</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published September 1991. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 6, 2001.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a> of the last two centuries--the <i>first</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>--was characterized by machines that extended, multiplied, and leveraged our physical capabilities. With these new machines, humans could manipulate objects for which our muscles alone were inadequate and carry out physical tasks at previously unachievable speeds. As a result, the world during this period was hungry for natural resources and labor. Mao's postulate that "power comes from the barrel of a gun" was true when he said it. Through physical coercion, one could control natural resources and compel people to labor. While not providing the happiest or most productive of workers, it worked well enough.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a>, the one that is now in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, is based on machines that extend, multiply, and leverage our mental abilities. A remarkable aspect of this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is that it uses almost no natural resources. <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> chips use infinitesimal amounts of sand and other readily available materials. They use insignificant amounts of electricity. As electronics, computers, and other forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>, for example) grow smaller and smaller, the material resources used are becoming an inconsequential portion of their value. Indeed, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> uses virtually no resources at all. The value of such <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> lies primarily in the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> governing the design of the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, and databases that constitute our intelligent machines, and in the ability to continue advancing these designs.</p>
<p>Today, even manufacturing is dominated by its <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, not by natural resources or labor. One has only to tour modern factories with their delicately programmed robotic assemblers and material handlers to recognize the increasing dominance of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as a cornerstone of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>. This decreasing importance of material resources has allowed Japan, a country very poor in natural resources but rich in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and expertise, to prosper. While the first <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a> increased the demand for and the value of natural resources the <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a> is doing the opposite.</p>
<p>In the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, it is apparent that one is paying for the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> inherent in the design and not for the raw materials represented by the <a class="thought" href="entries/floppy_disk_entry.html">floppy disk</a> and user's manual. What is sometimes less apparent is that the same economic model holds for most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> as well. An advanced chip generally costs no more to produce than a <a class="thought" href="entries/floppy_disk_entry.html">floppy disk</a>. As with a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, the bulk of the cost of a chip is neither raw materials nor manufacturing labor, but rather what accountants call amortization of development, and what philosophers call <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>It is estimated that raw materials comprise less than two percent of the value of chips (which is about the same estimate as for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>) and less than five percent of the value of computers. As our computers become more powerful, the percentage of their value accounted for by raw materials continues to diminish, approaching zero.</p><h1>Raw materials approaching zero</h1><p>It is interesting to note that the same (inverse exponential) trend holds for most other categories of products. Raw materials comprise about 20 percent of the value of musical instruments (down from about 60 percent ten years ago) with this figure continuing to rapidly decline as acoustic musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is being replaced with <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Just last year we reached the halfway point in the transformation of musical instruments from the 19th-century acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> electronics of the late 20th century: more than half of musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> industry revenues are now from <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> products. If we look at the typical <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> (a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> home keyboard, for example), it is basically a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with at least 90 percent of its value based on its <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>. By the end of this decade, more than 90 percent of all musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> industry revenues are expected to be based on this type of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/gilder_entry.html">George Gilder</a> (author of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">Wealth</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">Poverty</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/microcosm_entry.html">Microcosm</a>) estimates that the cost of raw materials for automobiles is now down to 40 percent of total costs. Again, this figure will continue to decline with the increasing use of computers and electronics as well as the replacement of expensive and relatively simple body materials such as steel with inexpensive yet relatively complex alternative materials such as new high-tech plastics.</p>
<p>Such routine products as tables and chairs have a rapidly increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> through the use of new materials and automated manufacturing methods that use little or no labor. Increasingly, the value of a manufactured product is its design and the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> controlling its automated manufacturing process, both forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of life</h1><p>This inexorable trend toward <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as the principal <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> affects even commodities. We are now beginning to master the ability to grow produce without soil. This will offer the opportunity to build factories that can create in large volume anything that grows. Since it will be possible to easily control pests in such an environment, insecticides and other chemicals will not be needed. <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">Bioengineering</a> will create the gene-altered vegetable, fruit, and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that can obtain their sustenance from a nutrient-enriched water. The same techniques will create varieties that provide optimal nutrition, taste, and other desirable properties. The process of cultivation and harvesting will be, of course, fully automated. Thus the value of such produce will consist of the genetic blueprints for these crops, the programming that controls this automated process and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. The first two are clearly dominated by <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The latter we will discuss in a moment .</p>
<p>Key to this landless revolution in agriculture is <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>. We are only now beginning to feel the impact of <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of momentous potential--both promising and perilous. By tinkering with the fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of life, we have the ability to create new materials and new life forms that can cure (or cause) <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, enhance (or spoil) our environment, and otherwise transform our lives. This <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is clearly <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> based: we are making programming changes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of life.</p>
<p>In mastering <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>, the first order of business is to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has already written. While a master programmer, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> forgot to document her code. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human genome project</a>, a multibillion-dollar federally supported effort, will write it all down (at least the human version). The result--six billion bits needed for the genetic definition of a human being--will fit on a couple of compact discs. Understanding it is another <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> for it is written in a dense <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_language_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> with few Rosetta stones available.</p>
<p>It may seem odd to extol the declining importance and value of natural resources when the attention of the world was recently riveted on a crisis centering on the availability and price of a quintessential material resource, oil. In response, I would point out that the <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a> is a gradual process and, while some industries have been almost totally revolutionized in the relative balance of material and intellectual resources, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is somewhat earlier in this process. For some <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> industry has been firmly stuck in the first <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>But it is not hard to see how we can ultimately replace oil with intellect. For example, with suitable innovations, we could eventually power our cars with electricity rather than gasoline. And we could go on to produce the electricity through new methods that do not involve the irreversible consumption of material resources. Ideas for achieving this range from the controversial breeder reactor to more benign solar and geothermal power. One has to wonder why the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> industry has been so resistant to entering the <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a>.</p><h1>The fortunate truth</h1><p>The most significant political development of the post-World War 11 era--the collapse of Communism--is a byproduct of the exigencies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a>. It is a fortunate truth of human <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and innovation cannot be forced. To create <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, people need the free exchange of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and ideas. They need free <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the world's accumulated <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> bases. A <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> that restricts <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to copiers and typewriters for fear of the dissemination of uncontrolled <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> will certainly fear the much more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies of PCs, FAX machines, <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">Email</a>, local area networks, telecommunication databases, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> bulletin boards, and all of the multifarious methods of instantaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>.</p>
<p>Controlled societies have been faced with a fundamental dilemma. If they provide their engineers and professionals in all disciplines with advanced workstation <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, they are opening the floodgates to free <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> by methods far more powerful than the copiers they have traditionally banned. On the other hand, if they fail to do so, they become increasingly ineffectual. The Soviet Union is already on a par with the more backward Third World countries economically. It has been a superpower only in the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> sphere, and with the increasing reliance of <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> strategy on intelligent weapons, this type of power has dissipated as well.</p>
<p>Innovation requires more than just <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> workstations and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies. It also requires an atmosphere of tolerance for new and unorthodox ideas, the encouragement of risk taking, and the ability to share ideas and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> run entirely by <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> bureaucracies is not in a position to provide the incentives and environment needed for entrepreneurship and the rapid development of new skills and technologies.</p><h1>The navigators of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a></h1><p>With <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> gradually asymptoting to 100 percent, we need to put the proper priority on the question of how to promote innovation, which is the creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that has economic value. Clearly, libraries have a crucial role to play here. A library is a repository of a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. For the past several hundred years, the primary medium for storing our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> has been books. In recent decades, we have supplemented books with other media: recordings, movies, and most recently <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> databases. Libraries have adjusted to each of these innovations and many offer <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in diverse forms.</p>
<p>Early in the next century, computerized <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> navigators will help us to explore the increasingly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that our libraries contain. Professor <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> of MIT contemplates a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> between two readers of LJ: "Can you imagine that they used to have libraries where the books didn't talk to each other?" We'll talk more about the library of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> in an upcoming column.</p>
<p>The age of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is the culmination of a process of <a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a> that began with the <a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a> of the English textile industry more than two and a half centuries ago. John Kay's flying shuttle and the myriad machines that followed have gradually transformed the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of work, by successively automating jobs at the lower rungs of the skill ladder while at the same time opening up new opportunities at the top of the ladder. With <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> firmly implanted as the foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and power in the late 20th and early 21st century, nurturing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>--its creation and dissemination--will be the cornerstone of our security.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most beneficial <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> of the age of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is the decentralization of power. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> does not simply foster <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and power, in the age of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> it is <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and power. By increasing our ability to master <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, we can each shape our <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> destiny.</p>
