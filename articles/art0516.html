<div class="TeaserText">In a recent Red Herring magazine article, writer Geoffrey James said "pundits can't stop hyping the business opportunities of artificial intelligence" and described AI as a "technological backwater." Ray Kurzweil challenges this view, citing "hundreds of examples of narrow AI deeply integrated into our information-based economy" and "many applications beginning to combine multiple methodologies," a step towards the eventual achievement of "strong AI" (human-level intelligence in a machine).
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Geoffrey James' myopic perspective on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> ("<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614003119/http://www.herring.com/insider/2002/08/ai082302.html">Out 
              of Their Minds</a>," August 2002) harkens back to the 1980s, 
              when many observers equated <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> with the single technique of "expert 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s." It has always been my view that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> properly refers 
              to a broad panoply of disciplines that emulate intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              and behaviors. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that technologists don't typically describe 
              their projects as "using AI" is the same <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> they don't 
              describe them as "using <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>." </p>
<p>Either of these descriptions are too broad to be useful. Far more 
              informative are the many subfields of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> such as <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, natural 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> processing, character recognition, "quant" investing, 
              etc. </p>
<p>There are today hundreds of examples of narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> deeply integrated 
              into our <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based economy. Routing emails and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone 
              calls, automatically diagnosing electrocardiograms and blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              images, directing cruise missiles and <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, automatically 
              landing airplanes, conducting <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-recognition based financial 
              transactions, detecting credit card fraud, and a myriad of other 
              automated tasks are all successful examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> in use today. 
              Many major industries (e.g., medical drug discovery, product design 
              of almost any product, including <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s themselves) are increasingly 
              reliant on these intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s. </p>
<p>To call this a "backwater" is hardly a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able perspective. 
              These <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>-based technologies simply did not exist or were in formative 
              stages only a decade ago. James is like those visitors to the rain 
              forest who plaintively ask "where are all these <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> I've 
              heard so much about?" when there are fifty <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of ant alone 
              within fifty yards. <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> predicted this, saying that intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s would become so deeply integrated in our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> as to be 
              all but invisible.</p>
<p>As an aside, I found it interesting that James' primary example 
              of a successful <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> company is ScanSoft, which used to be called 
              Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Products, which I founded in 1974.</p>
<p>With virtually every industry extensively using intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, 
              the trend now is that the "narrowness" of the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is gradually becoming less narrow, with many applications 
              beginning to combine multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies. "Strong AI" 
              is not a separate endeavor; rather it represents the culmination 
              of these ongoing and accelerating trends. </p>
<p>It will always be easy to scoff at <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> as long as there are tasks 
              at which humans are better, but the many derivatives of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              are becoming increasingly vital to our economy and <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You need the basic rules of the game Go and an astonishing computer to play by them. It will surely win.
<br>
<br>
Now, you can have some shortcuts. To avoid a lot of calculations. Some additional rules. Computer can now win with a less computing power.
<br>
<br>
Those rules, may be implemented via human programmer or generated by some genetic algorithms.
<br>
<br>
Both approaches take some time - but with more CPU - the second way is a faster one. Even yielding some rules, humans never invented.
<br>
<br>
It was the case for chess already. With a lot of computing power used, an algorithm was invented, how to always win with two bishops and the king against a king with two knights. In 222 moves in the worst case. Something like that.
<br>
<br>
It's a narrow breakthrough. But not before long, we will have plenty of them.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I agree whole heartedly with Mr. Kurzweil - ten (10) years ago I built a "fuzzy" expert system for GTE at their facility in Temple Terrace, FL.
<br>
The goal of the system was to mine data from multiple legacy sources - organize the information in such a manner as to load it into their exisitng "Central Office to the Curb" planning tool so that they had a true representation of their telephone service network topology for the a designated section.
<br>
The effort usually took a senior planner anywhere from two (2) weeks to a month on concerted effort - my "expert" gathered the data organized the information - identified trouble spots in the "circuit" and presented the planner with the network in forty - five (45) minutes, worst case.
<br>
The system also combined the expertise of three (3) different senior planners - who each conceded that it exceed their individual expertise. The product proved so useful that the employees involved were presented with GTE's Highest Technical Award - being a consultant I was not eligible even though they all conceded that I was the reason it happened.
<br>
<br>
I am now consult heavily in the Business Intelligence sector, primarily in Data Migration. The most predominate issue in this area is Data Cleansing - expert in the field conservatgely estimate that 90 percent of all data, (whether in databases or data warehouses/marts), is to some degree "dirty". By applying the significant research in "fuzzy logic" from fraud protection we have been able to build extremely sophisticated data cleansing procedures. These procedures are alos being adapted to enforce the "business rules" necessary to insure the future quality of the data.
<br>
<br>
Ten (10) years ago, today and multiple engagments between - I have been deploying advanced Artificial Intelligence processes to improve data quality and infomation efficiency.
<br>
<br>
I believe that AI is not only alive and well - but thanks to a low profile constantly growing!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>     Here are two sets of big questions--one fundamental, the other practical, just to spark some debate:
<br>
     Fundamental questions:  How likely is strong AI within the next 50 years?  Assuming, as I do, that consciousness is an epiphenomenon of the brain, how close are we to being able to develop software as complex as that which operates the human mind?  A top-down approach to writing such code doesn't appear too likely to succeed, but do we know enough to develop code that develops, like an organism?  Final fundamental question:  How close are we to being able to reverse-engineer the brain?  Most neuroscientists I've spoken too doubt that it will be possible within this century...obviously there are folks here, and throughout the computer science community who believe it will be possible within 30 years.
<br>
    Practical questions:  If investor and venture capitalist sentiment is accurately reflected by the Red Herring article, and with the government becoming more and more stingy with research funds, where is the development money for this technology to come from?  Consumer demand for computer technology in the developed world is slowing...as is demand for mobile communications technology.  Growth in both industries (at least in the West) is beginning to look like that in the auto industry--no longer exponential but asymptotic.  Are there enough short to mid term bells and whistles in the pipeline to stoke demand..enough to fund this research?  Are there enough consumers with enough wealth in the Third World to take up the slack?  Semiconductor production costs are through the roof...and I've read a few articles proclaiming the death of Moore's Law.  If so, is there is reasonable and inexpensive substitute for silicon chips available short-term?

The question of "strong-AI" itself need refinement.  I think that "consciousness" is possibly a distraction here.  It is certainly an "epiphenomenon of the brain", but perhaps not merely of "any logical operations that mimic brain-like behavior".  The issue of "artificial consciousness" is only one of ethics - it would be nice to know if you were "killing a sentient being" by unplugging a sufficiently able AI.  Beyond this, all that matters is really performance.
<br>
<br>
Some might argue that an "unconscious" (as we experience the feeling) AI could never compose beautiful or "moving" music.  I am not sure.  Perhaps the "appreciative, esthetic right-brain" can be emulated by something that is never "conscious" except by some formal definition.  But again, the import is one of ethics, not performance.
<br>
<br>
So the question becomes, "how would we decide that we have achieved strong-AI"?  What must it demonstrate to us that says "we have it now"?  If we had super-intelligent (trans-human-level) AI, what would we expect it to do for us?  What problems do we desire that it "solve" for us.  What jobs do we desire that it "manage" for us?
<br>
<br>
I think people need to realize that there are distinctly different kinds of problems.  Some are computationally intractible (saleman's tour) and for large sets, you either settle for a good approximation via heuristics, or must exhaust the entire problem space to arrive at the "optimum" solution.  You don't need "super-AI" for such problems, only "BIG-AI", lots of processing and memory.  You cannot "smart" your way to a shorter solution.
<br>
<br>
Other kinds of problems simply have no "objective best" solution, like the trade-off of X pounds of pollutants for Y pounds of product.  People will approach the issue with different fundamental values, and no "super-AI" is going to decide the "correct value point".
<br>
<br>
I see AI doing a great job (eventually) acting as my "trusted agent".  It can know who is knocking at my door, and let them in (or sound the alarm).  It can "surf the web" looking for only the things it knows would be of interest to me.  It can take my value system into account and decide when to buy and sell for me.  The list goes on and on.
<br>
<br>
Demonstrate a few applications such as these, and the demand for "AI" will grow.

Its a fact that technology becomes more advanced each year. Its a fact that our lives will change because of technology. AI is technology, nothing more nothing less. Thus, AI will change our lives, as it already is doing, but in ever so subtle ways. Deep AI as they have mentioned will become broader and deeper year by year. Its a fact. So get over it and move on!

<br>
Interesting concept.  Religion and politics are forms of weaponised art, in a sense.
<br>
<br>
&gt; "it will be able to create such beautiful constructions that a human would be forever captured by them. he (the human) could think of nothing else for the rest of his life."
<br>
<br>
Are you suggesting this would be an intentional seduction, a deliberate humanity-pacifier?  Or is this a metaphor for how humanity will naturally react to the inventive creations of a superior intelligence.
<br>
<br>
In either case, you see this as the end to "human striving to accomplish".  Yes?
<br>
<br>
&gt; "he would spend all of his time trying to imitate this great art, and would never have an original, inventive idea again."
<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever really had an "original, inventive idea", one that emerged on its own, independent of the influence of countless other ideas?  Even the most creative individuals evolved their personalities in the exchange of "ideas" with the environment.  Where is the boundary between "learned" and "created"?
<br>
<br>
&gt; "have you noticed all of the lousy frank lloyd wright immitations that you see all over the place? that's a mild example."
<br>
<br>
There are always more followers than leaders.

But I take it, you pose the question: "What becomes of human talent (and sense of worth) when artificial systems out-do us in all respects."

<br>
A very good question, I think.

As it turns humanity pacifying Art need be neither original, inspired, nor beautiful.  It exists today and ensares over 40% of the waking hours of some parts of the population in technologically advanced countries.  It is called television.

<br>
Cars (and many animals) are faster than humans, yet humans still run.  Cameras take much better pictures that humans can create, yet humans still paint (which is itself a technological product).  Just because AI can answer some questions faster, more completely, or more accurately, does not (necessarily) mean the end of human thinking.</p></td>

<br>
Why does some people, who acknowledge the outstanding power of human intelligence (HI) to solve difficult problems, simultaneoulsy deny to this HI the power to solve this particular problem of constructing other intelligences.
<br>
<br>
If those people doubt about the capabiblity of HI to solve the "intelligence problem" they are doubting (limiting) about the capability of the very thing they say to believe!.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I agree with the article too.
<br>
But I can't help seeing a difference between technology and AI integrating with our society, our lives, and the same integrating with our minds.
<br>
<br>
Lets say technology gets faster and more advanced, but what is it doing collectively? It is automating a lot of society if anything. We are evolving tools, like a stone and club to hit with, a bucket to carry water with, etc and on and on and now we have home automation, read the weather to predict where to buy crops maybe, etc.
<br>
<br>
I think we are trying to exert control over our environment with AI more than anything else. Interfacing with our minds is another matter.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think coupling data mining with new ways of visualising data that more closely match that which we are good at - ie our cognitive functions Instead of two-dimensional text, language and thinking like Top-Down, Bottom-Up etc we could try conceptualising things using Outside-In, Inside-Out (shake it all about), no seriously, a system isn't neccesarily a two dimensional thing, I had these thoughts about scanning through data graphically displayed like a broken volume/quantity chart, made up of custom slices of time instead of a whole section of time, and use the cursor keys to step forward and back in time, and have our eyes look for repetition. So much quicker than writing data mining algorithms, although having never written any I can;t clain that with authority.
<br>
Its four dimensional data, not two, or three. Its Intelligence Amplification (sorry no link) and I think it is a good direction to go in too. It isn't necesarily in opposition to AI as I have read once or twice. Its all part of the same technological progress Imo.</p></td>
