<div class="TeaserText">An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense "intuitive linear" view.  So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century -- it will be approximately 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The "returns," such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. This exponential growth is not restricted to hardware, but with accelerating gains in brain reverse engineering, also applies to software.  Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, allowing nonbiological intelligence to combine the subtleties of human intelligence with the speed and knowledge sharing ability of machines.  The results will include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, downloading the brain and immortal software-based humans -- the next step in evolution.</div>

<h2><br>
              An Overview of the Next Several Decades </h2>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8212;nonbiological entities&#8212;will 
              exceed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> early in this century. By <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              I include all the diverse and subtle ways in which humans are intelligent&#8212;including 
              musical and artistic aptitude, <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, physically moving through 
              the world, and even responding to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>. By 2019, a $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              will match the processing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brain&#8212;about 20 
              million billion calculations per second. This level of processing 
              power is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Organizing these resources&#8212;the 
              &#8220;software&#8221; of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8212;will take us to 2029, 
              by which <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> your average <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> will be equivalent 
              to a thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains. </p>
<p>Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> achieves a level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> comparable to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, it will necessarily soar past it. A key advantage 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can easily share 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. If I learn French, or read War and Peace, I can&#8217;t 
              readily <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to you. You have to acquire that 
              scholarship the same painstaking way that I did. My <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, embedded 
              in a vast <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations and interneuronal 
              connections, cannot be quickly <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed or transmitted. But we won&#8217;t 
              leave out quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports in our <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> equivalents 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters. When one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> learns a skill or gains 
              an insight, it can immediately share that <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> with billions of 
              other <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>As a contemporary example, we spent years teaching one <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> how to recognize continuous <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> speech. We exposed it 
              to thousands of hours of recorded speech, corrected its errors, 
              and patiently improved its performance. Finally, it became quite 
              adept at recognizing speech (I dictated most of my recent book to 
              it). Now if you want your own <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> to recognize speech, 
              it doesn&#8217;t have to go through the same process; you can just 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> the fully trained <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> in seconds. Ultimately, billions 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities can be the master of all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              acquired <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s are also potentially millions of times 
              faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> neural <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and have far more reliable memories. 
            </p>
<p>One approach to designing intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will be to copy 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, so these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will seem very <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. And through 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, which is the ability to create physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, they will have humanlike&#8212;albeit greatly enhanced&#8212;bodies 
              as well. Having <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> origins, they will claim to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, and 
              to have <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> feelings. And being immensely intelligent, they&#8217;ll 
              be very convincing when they tell us these things. But are these 
              feelings &#8220;real,&#8221; or just apparently real? I will discuss 
              this subtle but vital distinction below. First it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to 
              understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and how it 
              will emerge. </p>
<p>Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that this is not an alien invasion of intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. It is emerging from within our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. 
              There will not be a clear distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              as we go through the twenty-first century. First of all, we will 
              be putting <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s&#8212;neural implants&#8212;directly into our 
              brains. We&#8217;ve already started down this path. We have ventral 
              posterior <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, subthalmic <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, and ventral lateral thalamus 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s to counteract Parkinson&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a> and tremors 
              from other neurological disorders. I have a deaf friend who now 
              can hear what I am saying because of his <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>. Under 
              development is a <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> implant that will perform a similar function 
              for blind <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, basically replacing certain visual processing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> and nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Recently scientists from 
              Emory University placed a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of a paralyzed stroke 
              victim who can now begin to communicate and control his environment 
              directly from his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2020s, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s will not be just for disabled people, 
              and introducing these implants into the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will not require surgery, 
              but more about that later. There will be ubiquitous use of neural 
              implants to improve our sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, 
              and logical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. </p>
<p>These &#8220;noninvasive&#8221; implants will also plug us in directly 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a>. By 2030, &#8220;going to a web site&#8221; 
              will mean entering a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment. The implant will 
              generate the streams of sensory input that would otherwise come 
              from our real senses, thus creating an all-encompassing virtual 
              environment that responds to the behavior of our own <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_body_entry.html">virtual body</a> 
              (and those of others) in the virtual environment. This <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              will enable us to have <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s with other people&#8212;or 
              simulated people&#8212;without requiring any equipment not already 
              in our heads. And <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will not be the crude <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              that one can <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in today&#8217;s arcade games. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> 
              will be as realistic, detailed, and subtle as real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. So instead 
              of just phoning a friend, you can meet in a virtual French caf&#233; 
              in Paris, or take a walk on a virtual Mediterranean beach, and it 
              will seem very real. People will be able to have any type of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              with anyone&#8212;business, social, romantic, sexual&#8212;regardless 
              of physical proximity. </p>
<h2> The <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">Growth</a> of Computing</h2>
<p></p>
<p>To see into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, we need insight into the past. We need 
              to discern the relevant trends and their interactions. Many projections 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> suffer from three common failures. The first is that 
              people often consider only one or two iterations of advancement 
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, as if <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> would then come to a halt. </p>
<p>A second is focusing on only one aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, without 
              considering the interactions and synergies from developments in 
              multiple fields (e.g. <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, amongst others).</p>
<p>By far the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant failure is to fail to adequately take 
              into consideration the accelerating pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Many predictions 
              do not factor this in with any consistent <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology, if at all. 
              Ten thousand years ago, there was little <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> technological change 
              in even a thousand years. A thousand years ago, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> was much 
              faster and a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> required only a century or two. In the 
              nineteenth century, we saw more technological change than in the 
              nine centuries preceding it. Then in the first twenty years of the 
              twentieth century, we saw more advancement than in all of the nineteenth 
              century. Now, <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s (and new business models) take place 
              in only a few years <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (lately it appears to be even less than 
              that). Just a decade ago, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> was in a formative stage 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> had yet to emerge</p>
<p>The fact that the successful application of certain innovations 
              (e.g., the <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a>) may have taken several decades in the past half 
              century does not mean that, going forward, comparable changes will 
              take nearly as long. The type of transformation that required thirty 
              years during the last half century will take only five to seven 
              years going forward. And the pace will continue to accelerate. It 
              is vital to consider the implications of this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>; <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              is not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>, but exponential.</p>
<p>This &#8220;law of accelerating returns,&#8221; as I call it, is 
              true of any <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. It was true of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms, which required billions of years for the first steps 
              (e.g. primitive cells); later on <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> accelerated. During the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion, major <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s took only tens of millions 
              of years. Later on, <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a>s developed over a period of only millions 
              of years, and <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> over a period of hundreds of thousands 
              of years. </p>
<p>With the advent of a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, the exponential 
              pace became too fast for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-guided <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> 
              and moved on to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-created <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The first technological 
              steps &#8212; sharp edges, fire, the wheel&#8212;took tens of thousands 
              of years, and have accelerated ever since.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by other means. It is the cutting edge 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> today, moving far faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. 
              However, unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is not a &#8220;blind 
              watchmaker.&#8221; (Actually, I would prefer the phrase &#8220;mindless 
              watchmaker&#8221; as more descriptive and less insensitive to the 
              visually impaired.) The process of humans creating <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, then, 
              is a &#8220;mindful watchmaker.&#8221; An implication is that we do 
              have the ability (and the responsibility) to guide this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process in a constructive direction. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> goes beyond mere toolmaking; it is a process of creating 
              ever more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> using the tools from the previous 
              round of innovation. In this way, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is distinguished 
              from the toolmaking of other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. There is a record of each 
              stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and each new stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> builds on 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of the previous stage. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>, therefore, is a continuation 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process that gave rise to the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> creating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in the first place.</p>
<p>It is critical when considering the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to use a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology that considers these three issues: (i) iterations of 
              technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> do not just stop at an arbitrary point, (ii) 
              diverse developments interact, and, most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, (iii) the 
              pace of technological innovation accelerates. This third item can 
              be quantified, which I discuss in the sidebar below. Although these 
              formulas are not perfect models, they do provide a framework for 
              considering <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments. I&#8217;ve used this <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology 
              for the past twenty years, and the predictions derived from this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> in the 1980s have held up rather well. </p>
<p>One very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant trend is referred to as &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Law.&#8221; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, one of the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, and then 
              chairman of Intel, noted in the mid-1970s that we could squeeze 
              twice as many <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> every twenty-four 
              months. The implication is that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, which are built from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, are doubling in power every two years. Lately, 
              the rate has been even faster. </p>

<p>After sixty years of devoted service, Moore&#8217;s Law will die 
              a dignified <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> no later than the year 2019. By that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              features will be just a few atoms in width, and the strategy of 
              ever finer photolithography will have run its course. So, will that 
              be the end of the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bet on it. </p>
<p>If we plot the speed (in instructions per second) per $1000 (in 
              constant dollars) of 49 famous <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s spanning 
              the entire twentieth century, we note some interesting observations. 
            </p>
<p>It is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to note that Moore&#8217;s Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated Circuit</a>s 
              was not the first, but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide accelerating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a>. Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s have been consistently multiplying 
              in power (per unit of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) from the mechanical calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s 
              used in the 1890 U.S. census, to Turing&#8217;s relay-based &#8220;Robinson&#8221; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that cracked the Nazi <a class="thought" href="entries/enigma_code_entry.html">enigma code</a>, to the CBS <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that predicted the election of Eisenhower, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>-based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s used in the first <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> launches, to the integrated-<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>-based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> which I used to dictate (and automatically transcribe) 
              this chapter. </p>
<p>But I noticed something else surprising. When I plotted the 49 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on a logarithmic graph (where a straight line means exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>), I didn&#8217;t get a straight line. What I got was another 
              exponential curve. In other words, there&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
              in the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> speed (per unit cost) 
              doubled every three years between 1910 and 1950, doubled every two 
              years between 1950 and 1966, and is now doubling every year. </p>
<p>Wherefrom Moore&#8217;s Law: </p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Where does Moore&#8217;s Law come from? What is behind this remarkably 
              predictable <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>? I have seen relatively little written about 
              the ultimate source of this trend. Is it just &#8220;a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of industry 
              expectations and goals,&#8221; as Randy Isaac, head of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, contends?</p>
<p>In my view, it is one manifestation (among many) of the exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process that is <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Just as the 
              pace of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process accelerates, the &#8220;returns&#8221; 
              (i.e., the output, the products) of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process grow 
              exponentially. The <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing is a marvelous 
              quantitative example of the exponentially growing returns from an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. We can also express the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
              of computing in terms of an accelerating pace: It took 90 years 
              to achieve the first Multiple in Power (MIP) per thousand dollars; 
              now we add a MIP per thousand dollars every day. </p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s Law narrowly refers to the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> of fixed size, and sometimes has been expressed 
              even more narrowly in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> feature size. But rather 
              than feature size (which is only one contributing factor), or even 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, I think the most <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> measure to track 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al speed per unit cost. This takes into account many 
              levels of &#8220;cleverness&#8221; (i.e., innovation, which is to 
              say technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>). In addition to all of the innovation 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, there are multiple layers of innovation 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> design, e.g., pipelining, <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a>, instruction 
              look-ahead, instruction and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> caching, etc. </p>
<p>From the above chart, we see that the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing 
              didn&#8217;t start with <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s (around 1958), or even 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s (around 1947), but goes back to the electromechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s used in the 1890 and 1900 U.S. census. This chart spans 
              at least five distinct <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s of computing (electromechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, relay-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and finally <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>s), 
              of which Moore&#8217;s Law pertains to only the latest one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious what the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> will be after Moore&#8217;s 
              Law runs out of steam before 2019 (because before then <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              feature sizes will be just a few atoms in width). Chips today are 
              flat (although it does require up to 20 layers of material to produce 
              one layer of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry). Our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, in contrast, is organized in 
              three dimensions. We live in a three-dimensional world; why not 
              use the third dimension? There are many technologies in the wings 
              that build <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry in three dimensions. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">Nanotubes</a>, for example, 
              which are already working in laboratories, build <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s from pentagonal 
              arrays of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms. One cubic inch of nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry would 
              be a million times more powerful than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>Thus the (double) <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing is broader than 
              Moore&#8217;s Law. And this accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of computing is, 
              in turn, part of a yet broader <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> discussed above, the accelerating 
              pace of any <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. In my book, I discuss the link 
              between the pace of a process and the degree of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> versus <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              in the process. For example, in cosmological <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> 
              started with little <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, so the first three major <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s 
              (the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, and the emergence 
              of the four fundamental forces) all occurred in the first billionth 
              of a second; now with vast <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, cosmological <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s take 
              billions of years. </p>
<p>Observers are quick to criticize extrapolations of an exponential 
              trend on the basis that the trend is bound to run out of &#8220;resources.&#8221; 
              The classical example is when a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> happens upon a new habitat 
              (e.g., rabbits in Australia), the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>&#8217; <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s will grow 
              exponentially for a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but then hit a limit when resources such 
              as food and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> run out. But the resources underlying the exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process are relatively unbounded: (i) 
              the (ever growing) <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process itself, and 
              (ii) the <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> of the environment in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process 
              takes place and which provides the options for further <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>. 
            </p>
<p>We also need to distinguish between the S curve (very slow virtually 
              unnoticeable <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> followed by very rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> followed by the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> leveling off and reaching an asymptote) that is characteristic 
              of any specific technological <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> and the continuing exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> that is characteristic of the ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s, such as Moore&#8217;s Law (i.e., 
              achieving faster and denser <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> through shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              sizes on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>), do ultimately reach levels at which 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is no longer feasible. Thus Moore&#8217;s Law 
              is an S curve. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is an ongoing exponential. 
              What turns the S curve (of any specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>) into a continuing 
              exponential is <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> (also called innovation), in which 
              a new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> (e.g., three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s) takes over when 
              the old <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> approaches its natural limit. This has already 
              happened at least four times in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. This 
              difference also distinguishes the toolmaking of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, 
              in which the mastery of a toolmaking (or using) skill by each <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> 
              is characterized by an S-shaped <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> curve, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-created 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which has been following an exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              and acceleration since its inception. </p>
<p>I discuss all of this in more detail in the first couple of chapters 
              of my book.</p>
<p>In the sidebar below, I include a mathematical model of the law 
              of accelerating returns as it pertains to the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
              of computing. The formulas below result in the following graph of 
              the continued <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. This graph matches the available 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> for the twentieth century and provides projections for the 
              twenty-first century. Note how the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">Growth</a> Rate is growing slowly, 
              but nonetheless exponentially. </p>
<p>Another <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trend that will have <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant implications 
              for the twenty-first century is <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>. A related analysis 
              can be made of this trend which shows that the <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation 
              sizes of a broad range of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are shrinking, also at a double 
              exponential rate. At present, we are shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> by a factor 
              of approximately 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per decade.</p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a> Applied to the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">Growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a></h2>
<p>The following provides a brief overview of the law of accelerating 
              returns as it applies to the double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. 
              This model considers the impact of the growing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              to foster its own next generation. For example, with more powerful 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and related <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we have the tools and the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              to design yet more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and to do so more quickly. 
            </p>
<p>Note that the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> for the year 2000 and beyond assume neural net 
              connection calculations as it is expected that this type of calculation 
              will dominate, particularly in emulating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functions. 
              This type of calculation is less expensive than conventional (e.g., 
              Pentium III) calculations by a factor of 10 (particularly if <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed 
              using <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, which would correspond 
              well to the brain&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> electrochemical 
              processes). A factor of 10 translates into approximately 3 years 
              (today) and less than 3 years later in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>My estimate of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> is 100 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s times an average 
              1,000 connections per <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> (with the calculations taking place 
              primarily in the connections) times 200 calculations per second. 
              Although these estimates are conservatively high, one can find higher 
              and lower estimates. However, even much higher (or lower) estimates 
              by orders of magnitude only shift the prediction by a relatively 
              small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of years.</p>
<p>Some <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> dates from this analysis include the following:</p>
<p>We achieve one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> capability (2 * 10^16 cps) for $1,000 
              around the year 2023.</p>
<p>We achieve one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> capability (2 * 10^16 cps) for one cent 
              around the year 2037.</p>
<p>We achieve one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Race capability (2 * 10^26 cps) for $1,000 
              around the year 2049.</p>
<p>We achieve one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Race capability (2 * 10^26 cps) for one cent 
              around the year 2059. </p>
<p>The Model considers the following variables:</p>
<p>V: <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">Velocity</a> (i.e., power) of computing (measured in CPS/unit cost)</p>
<p>W: World <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> as it pertains to designing and building <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s</p>
<p>t: <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a></p>
<p>The assumptions of the model are: </p>
<p>(1) V = C1 * W </p>
<p>In other words, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power is a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              of how to build <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. This is actually a conservative assumption. 
              In general, innovations improve V (<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power) by a multiple, 
              not in an additive way. Independent innovations multiply each other&#8217;s 
              effect. For example, a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> advance such as CMOS, a more efficient 
              IC wiring <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology, and a processor innovation such as pipelining 
              all increase V by independent multiples. </p>
<p>(2) W = C2 * Integral (0 to t) V </p>
<p>In other words, W (<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>) is cumulative, and the instantaneous 
              increment to <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is proportional to V. </p>
<p>This gives us:</p>
<p>W = C1 * C2 * Integral (0 to t) W</p>
<p>W = C1 * C2 * C3 ^ (C4 * t)</p>
<p>V = C1 ^ 2 * C2 * C3 ^ (C4 * t)</p>
<p>(Note on notation: a^b means a raised to the b power.)</p>
<p>Simplifying the constants, we get:</p>
<p>V = Ca * Cb ^ (Cc * t)</p>
<p>So this is a formula for &#8220;accelerating&#8221; (i.e., exponentially 
              growing) returns, a &#8220;regular Moore&#8217;s Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> shows <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in the 
              rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. (We doubled <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power every three 
              years early in the twentieth century, every two years in the middle 
              of the century, and close to every one year during the 1990s.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s factor in another exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>, which is the 
              growing resources for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Not only is each (constant cost) 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> getting more powerful as a function of W, but the resources 
              deployed for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> are also growing exponentially.</p>
<p>We now have: </p>
<p>N: Expenditures for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a></p>
<p>V = C1 * W (as before)</p>
<p>N = C4 ^ (C5 * t) (Expenditure for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is growing at its 
              own exponential rate)</p>
<p>W = C2 * Integral (0 to t) (N * V) </p>
<p>As before, world <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is accumulating, and the instantaneous 
              increment is proportional to the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, which equals 
              the resources deployed for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> (N) * the power of each (constant 
              cost) <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. </p>
<p>This gives us:</p>
<p>W = C1 * C2 * Integral(0 to t) (C4 ^ (C5 * t) * W)</p>
<p>W = C1 * C2 * (C3 ^ (C6 * t)) ^ (C7 * t)</p>
<p>V = C1 ^ 2 * C2 * (C3 ^ (C6 * t)) ^ (C7 * t)</p>
<p>Simplifying the constants, we get:</p>
<p>V = Ca * (Cb ^ (Cc * t)) ^ (Cd * t)</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a double exponential&#8212;an exponential curve in which 
              the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is growing at a different exponential 
              rate.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s consider real-world <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. Considering the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> for 
              actual calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s during the twentieth century: 
            </p>
<p>CPS/$1K: Calculations Per Second for $1,000</p>
<p>Twentieth century computing <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> matches: </p>
<p>CPS/$1K = 10^(6.00*((20.40/6.00)^((A13-1900)/100))-11.00)</p>
<p>We can determine the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate over a period of time:</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">Growth</a> Rate =10^((LOG(CPS/$1K for Current Year)&#8212;LOG(CPS/$1K 
              for Previous Year))/(Current Year&#8212;Previous Year))</p>

<p>In a process, the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> interval between <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> events expands 
              or contracts along with the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. This relationship is 
              one key to understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
              of computing will survive the demise of Moore&#8217;s Law. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> 
              started with vast <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> and little effective <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, so early <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              was slow. But <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> creates ever-increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. That is, 
              after all, the essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a> is the opposite of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, 
              so when <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in a process increases&#8212;as is the case for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>&#8212;time 
              speeds up. I call this <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant sub-law the &#8220;law of accelerating 
              returns,&#8221; to contrast it with a better known law in which returns 
              diminish. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a> represents the essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Being

              exponentially. There are many examples of the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> 
              in technological speeds and capacities. For example, when the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>

              in under fifteen years. Other examples include the accelerating

<p>A sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> will take over from Moore&#8217;s Law, just as 
              Moore&#8217;s Law took over from discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> 
              tubes before that. There are many emerging technologies for new

              periods dramatically underestimate the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              because they are based on what I call the &#8220;intuitive <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>&#8221; 
              view of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> rather than the &#8220;historical 
              exponential view.&#8221; To express this another way, it is not the 
              case that we will <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> a hundred years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the 
              twenty-first century; rather we will witness on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of twenty 
              thousand years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> (from the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> perspective, that is). 
            </p>
<p>When people think of a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> period, they intuitively assume that 
              the current rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> will continue for the period being 
              considered. However, careful consideration of the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              shows that the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is not constant, but it is <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> to adapt to the changing pace, so the intuitive view is that 
              the pace will continue at the current rate. Even for those of us 
              who have lived through a sufficiently long period of technological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> how the pace increases over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, our unexamined 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> nonetheless provides the impression that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> changes 
              at the rate that we have <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d recently. A <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> 
              for this is that an exponential curve approximates a straight line 
              when viewed for a brief duration. So even though the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in the very recent past (e.g., this past year) is far greater than 
              it was ten years ago (let alone a hundred or a thousand years ago), 
              our memories are nonetheless dominated by our very recent <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              Since the rate has not changed significantly in the very recent 
              past (because a very small piece of an exponential curve is approximately 
              straight), it is an understandable misperception to view the pace 
              of change as a constant. It is typical, therefore, that even sophisticated 
              commentators, when considering the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, extrapolate the current 
              pace of change over the next ten years or hundred years to determine 
              their expectations. This is why I call this way of looking at the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> the &#8220;intuitive <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>&#8221; view. </p>
<p>But any serious consideration of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> shows 
              that technological change is at least exponential, not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>. There 
              are a great many examples of this which I have discussed above. 
              One can examine this <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in many different ways, and on many different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scales, and for a wide variety of different phenomena, and 
              the (at least) double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> implied by the law of accelerating 
              returns applies. The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> does not rely on 
              an assumption of the continuation of Moore&#8217;s law, but is based 
              on a rich model of diverse technological processes. What it clearly 
              shows is that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, particularly the pace of technological 
              change, advances (at least) exponentially, not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly, and has 
              been doing so since the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, indeed since the advent 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. </p>
<p>Most <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forecasts ignore altogether this &#8220;historical 
              exponential view&#8221; of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and assume instead 
              the &#8220;intuitive <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> view.&#8221; Although the evidence is 
              compelling, it still requires study and modeling of many diverse 
              events to see this exponential aspect. That is why people tend to 
              overestimate what can be achieved in the short term (because we 
              tend to leave out necessary details), but underestimate what can 
              be achieved in the long term (because the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is 
              ignored). </p>
<p>This observation also applies to <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rates, which are 
              currently doubling (approximately) every decade; that is <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              shift times are halving every decade (and this rate is also changing 
              slowly, but nonetheless exponentially). So, the technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in the twenty-first century will be equivalent to what would require 
              (in the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> view) on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of twenty thousand years. In terms 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of computing, the comparison is even more dramatic.

<p>The most compelling scenario for mastering the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is to tap into the blueprint of the best example we can get our

              It took its original designer several billion years to develop. 
              And it&#8217;s not even <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a>ed. </p>
<p>The most immediately <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible way to accomplish this is through 
              destructive scanning: we take a frozen <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, preferably one frozen 
              just slightly before rather than slightly after it was going to 
              die anyway, and examine one <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> layer&#8212;one very thin slice&#8212;at 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. We can readily see every <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> and every connection and

              layer. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning has already started. A condemned killer allowed 
              his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body to be scanned and you can <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> all 10 billion 
              bytes of him on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. He has a 25 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/byte_entry.html">byte</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> companion

              enough resolution for our purposes, but then we probably don&#8217;t 
              want to base our templates of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              of a convicted killer, anyway. </p>
<p>But scanning a frozen <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is feasible today, albeit not yet at 
              a sufficient speed or <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, but again, the law of accelerating 
              returns will provide the requisite speed of scanning, just as it 
              did for the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> scan. </p>
<p>We also have noninvasive scanning techniques today, including high-resolution 
              magnetic resonance imaging (<a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>) scans, <a class="thought" href="entries/optical_imaging_entry.html">optical imaging</a>, near-infrared

              with each new generation, just what we would expect from the law 
              of accelerating returns. <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> generations will enable us to resolve 
              the connections between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, and to peer inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s 
              and record the <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations. </p>
<p>We can peer inside someone&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> today with noninvasive 
              scanners, which are increasing their resolution with each new generation 
              of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. There are a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of technical challenges in 
              accomplishing this, including achieving suitable resolution, <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, 
              lack of vibration, and safety. For a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s it is easier 
              to scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of someone recently deceased than of someone still 
              living. It is easier to get someone deceased to sit still, for one 
              thing. But noninvasively scanning a living <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will ultimately 
              become feasible as <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>, optical, and other scanning technologies 
              continue to improve in resolution and speed.</p>
<p>In fact, the driving force behind the rapidly improving capability 
              of noninvasive scanning technologies is again the law of accelerating 
              returns, because it requires massive <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al ability to build 
              the high-resolution three-dimensional images. The exponentially 
              increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al ability provided by the law of accelerating 
              returns (and for another 10 to 20 years, Moore&#8217;s Law) will 
              enable us to continue to rapidly improve the resolution and speed

              scan every <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> neural detail from up close. Using high-speed

<p>This scenario involves only capabilities we can touch and feel 
              today. We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> capable of producing very high-resolution 
              scans provided that the scanner is physically proximate to the neural 
              features.

              also essentially feasible today. The primary features that are not 
              yet practical are <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> size and cost. As I discussed above, we 
              can project the exponentially declining cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">Miniaturization</a> 
              is another readily predictable aspect of the law of accelerating

              at Berkeley are tiny flying robots called &#8220;smart dust,&#8221; 
              which are approximately one millimeter wide (about the size of a 
              grain of sand), and capable of flying, sensing, computing, and communicating 
              using tiny lasers and hinged micro-flaps and micro-mirrors. The 
              size of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> will continue to shrink at an exponential 
              rate, currently by a factor of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per decade. 
              We can conservatively expect, therefore, the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              by around 2030. Because of its ability to place each scanner in

              scanning will be more practical than scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from outside.

<h2>How to Use Your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">Brain Scan</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>How will we apply the thousands of trillions of bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              derived from each <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>? One approach is to use the results 
              to design more intelligent parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s for our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              particularly those based on one of the neural net <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s. With 
              this approach, we don&#8217;t have to copy every single connection. 
              There is a great deal of repetition and redundancy within any particular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> region. Although the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> contained in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>

              the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 100 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s times an average of 1,000 connections 
              per <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, each with multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations and 
              connection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>), the design of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is characterized by a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> of only about a billion bytes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is redundant, so the initial design 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is characterized by approximately one hundred million 
              bytes, about the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word. Of course, the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
              of our brains greatly increases as we interact with the world (by 
              a factor of more than ten million). It is not necessary, however, 
              to capture each detail in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a>

              simulated nets that operate similarly. There are already multiple 
              efforts under way to scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and apply the insights 
              derived to the design of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. The ATR (Advanced 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">Telecommunications</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>) Lab in Kyoto, Japan, for example, is

              at much faster speeds. </p>
<p>After the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s of a region are understood, they can be refined 
              and extended before being <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed in synthetic neural equivalents.

              And we can also throw in the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s for building intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s

<p>A recent <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> at San Diego&#8217;s Institute for Nonlinear 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> demonstrates the potential for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s to precisely

              prime example of what is often called &#8220;chaotic computing.&#8221; 
              Each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> acts in an essentially unpredictable fashion. When an 
              entire <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s receives input (from the outside world 
              or from other <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s), the signaling amongst them appears 
              at first to be frenzied and random. Over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, typically a fraction 
              of a second or so, the chaotic interplay of the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s dies down, 
              and a stable <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> emerges. This <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> represents the &#8220;decision&#8221; 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>. If the <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> is performing a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              recognition task (which, incidentally, comprises more than 95% of 
              the activity in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>), then the emergent <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> represents 
              the appropriate recognition. </p>
<p>So the question addressed by the San Diego <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers was whether 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s could engage in this chaotic dance alongside 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> ones. They hooked up their artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s with those 
              from spiney lobsters in a single <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, and their hybrid <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> performed in the same way (i.e., chaotic interplay followed 
              by a stable emergent <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>) and with the same type of results 
              as an all <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> net of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Essentially, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s accepted their <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> peers. It indicates that their

<p>There are many projects around the world, which are creating <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and which recreate in great detail the functionality of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters, and the accuracy and scale of these <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> 
              clusters replications are rapidly increasing. We started with functionally 
              equivalent recreations of single <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, then clusters of tens, 
              then hundreds, and now thousands. Scaling up technical processes

<p></p>
<p>The answer depends on what we mean by the word &#8220;computer.&#8221; 
              Certainly the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> uses very different <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s from conventional 
              contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s today are all <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and 
              perform one (or perhaps a few) <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>(s) at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at extremely 
              high speed. In contrast, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> combines <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s with most <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s performed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>. The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is massively parallel, performing on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a hundred 
              trillion <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but at extremely slow speeds. 
            </p>
<p>With regard to <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> versus <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing, we know that <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              computing can be functionally equivalent to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing (although 
              the reverse is not true), so we can perform all of the capabilities 
              of a hybrid <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>&#8212;analog <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> with an all <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              On the other hand, there is an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering advantage to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s 
              in that <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing is potentially thousands of times more 
              efficient. An <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> can be performed by a few <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, 
              or, in the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, specific electrochemical processes. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> in contrast requires thousands or tens of 
              thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. So there is a significant efficiency advantage 
              to emulating the brain&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. </p>
<p>The massive parallelism of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is the key to its <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              recognition abilities, which reflects the strength of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. 
              As I discussed above, <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s engage in a chaotic dance, 
              and if the <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> has learned its lessons well, then a stable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> will emerge reflecting the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>&#8217;s decision. There 
              is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why our <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> functionally-equivalent recreations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s cannot be built using these same principles, 
              and indeed there are dozens of projects around the world that have 
              succeeded in doing this. My own technical field is <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, 
              and the projects that I have been involved in for over thirty years 
              use this form of chaotic computing. Particularly successful examples 
              are <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a>&#8217;s neural chips, which are highly parallel, 
              use <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing, and are intended as functionally 
              similar recreations of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. </p>
<p>As we create <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> but functionally equivalent recreations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s ranging from clusters of dozens of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s up to entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains and beyond, we can combine the 
              qualities of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> with certain advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              My <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and skills exist in my <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> as vast <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s 
              of interneuronal connections, <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations, and 
              other neural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, 
              there are no quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports for these <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s in our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s, but as we build <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> equivalents, we will 
              not leave out the ability to quickly load <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s representing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and skills. </p>
<p>Although it is remarkable that as complex and capable an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> evolved through natural selection, aspects of 
              its design are nonetheless extremely inefficient. <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">Neuron</a>s are very 
              bulky <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and at least ten million times slower in their <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              processing than <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s. As we combine the brain&#8217;s

              and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> accuracy advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the 
              combination will be formidable.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">Object</a>ive and Subjective</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Although I anticipate that the most common application of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              gained from <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will be creating 
              more intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that are not necessarily modeled on specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, the scenario of scanning and reinstantiating all of 
              the neural details of a particular person raises the most immediate 
              questions of <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>. Let&#8217;s consider the question of what 
              we will find when we do this. </p>
<p>We have to consider this question on both the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive and subjective 
              levels. &#8220;Objective&#8221; means everyone except me, so let&#8217;s 
              start with that. <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">Object</a>ively, when we scan someone&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              and reinstantiate their personal <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a> into a suitable computing 
              medium, the newly emergent &#8220;person&#8221; will appear to other 
              observers to have very much the same personality, <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> 
              as the person originally scanned. That is, once the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has 
              been refined and perfected. Like any new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it won&#8217;t 
              be perfect at first. But ultimately, the scans and recreations will 
              be very accurate and realistic. </p>
<p>Interacting with the newly instantiated person will feel like interacting 
              with the original person. The new person will claim to be that same 
              old person and will have a <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of having been that person. The 
              new person will have all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, skill, and 
              personality of the original. We are already creating functionally 
              equivalent recreations of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> clusters with sufficient 
              accuracy that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s accept their <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> equivalents 
              and work with them as if they were <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>. There are no natural 
              limits that prevent us from doing the same with the hundred billion 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> cluster we call the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>Subjectively, the issue is more subtle and profound, but first 
              we need to reflect on one additional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive issue: our physical 
              self. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">Import</a>ance of Having a Body</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Consider how many of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is directed towards 
              our body and its survival, security, nutrition, image, not to mention 
              affection, sexuality, and reproduction. Many, if not most, of the 
              goals we attempt to advance using our brains have to do with our 
              bodies: protecting them, providing them with fuel, making them attractive, 
              making them feel good, providing for their myriad needs and desires. 
              Some philosophers maintain that achieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is impossible without a body. If we&#8217;re going to <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a> a human&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> to a new <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al medium, we&#8217;d better provide a body. 
              A disembodied <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> will quickly get depressed. </p>
<p>There are a variety of bodies that we will provide for our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              and that they will provide for themselves: bodies built through 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> (an emerging field devoted to building highly complex 
              physical entities <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>), virtual bodies (that exist only 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>), bodies comprised of swarms of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s. </p>
<p>A common scenario will be to enhance a person&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with intimate connection to <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. In 
              this case, the body remains the good old <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body that we&#8217;re 
              familiar with, although this too will become greatly enhanced through 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> (gene enhancement and replacement) and, later on, 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. A detailed examination of twenty-first century 
              bodies is beyond the scope of this chapter, but is examined in chapter 
              seven of my recent book The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>. </p>

<h2>So Just Who are These People?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>To return to the issue of subjectivity, consider: Is the reinstantiated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> the same <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as the person we just scanned? Are these 
              &#8220;people&#8221; conscious at all? Is this a <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> or just a brain? 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> in our twenty-first century <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be a critically 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issue. But it is not easily resolved, or even readily 
              understood. People tend to have strong views on the subject, and 
              often just can&#8217;t understand how anyone else could possibly 
              see the issue from a different perspective. <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> observed 
              that &#8220;there&#8217;s something queer about describing <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. 
              Whatever people mean to say, they just can&#8217;t seem to make it 
              clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t worry, at least not yet, about causing pain and suffering 
              to our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. But at what point do we consider an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, 
              a process, to be conscious, to feel pain and discomfort, to have 
              its own intentionality, its own <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>? How do we determine if 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is conscious; if it has <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>? How do 
              we distinguish a process that is conscious from one that just acts 
              as if it is conscious?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t simply ask it. If it says, &#8220;Hey I&#8217;m conscious,&#8221; 
              does that settle the issue? No, we have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> games today that 
              effectively do that, and they&#8217;re not terribly convincing. </p>
<p>How about if the <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is very convincing and compelling when 
              it says, &#8220;I&#8217;m lonely, please keep me company&#8221;? Does 
              that settle the issue? </p>
<p>If we look inside its <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and see essentially the identical 
              kinds of feedback loops and other mechanisms in its <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that we 
              see in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (albeit <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed using <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> equivalents), 
              does that settle the issue?</p>
<p>And just who are these people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, anyway? The answer 
              will depend on who you ask. If you ask the people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, 
              they will strenuously claim to be the original persons. For example, 
              if we scan&#8212;let&#8217;s say myself&#8212;and record the exact 
              state, level, and position of every <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>, neural 
              connection, and every other relevant detail, and then reinstantiate 
              this massive <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> base of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (which I estimate at thousands 
              of trillions of bytes) into a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural computer</a> of sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, 
              the person that then emerges in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will think that he is 
              (and had been) me. He will say &#8220;I grew up in Queens, New York, 
              went to college at MIT, stayed in the Boston area, sold a few artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> companies, walked into a scanner there, and woke up 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> here. Hey, this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> really works.&#8221;</p>
<p>But wait. Is this really me? For one thing, old <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> Ray 
              (that&#8217;s me) still exists. I&#8217;ll still be here in my <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Alas, I will have to sit back and watch the new Ray succeed 
              in endeavors that I could only <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of. </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>A <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the issue of just who I am, and who the new 
              Ray is a little more carefully. First of all, am I the stuff in 
              my <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body? </p>
<p>Consider that the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s making up my body and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are constantly 
              changing. We are not at all permanent collections of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s. 
              The cells in our bodies turn over at different rates, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s 
              (e.g., atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s) that comprise our cells are exchanged 
              at a very rapid rate. I am just not the same collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s 
              that I was even a month ago. It is the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              that are semipermanent (that is, changing only gradually), but our 
              actual material <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> is changing constantly, and very quickly. 
              We are rather like the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s that water makes in a stream. The 
              rushing water around a formation of rocks makes a particular, unique 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>. This <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> may remain relatively unchanged for hours, 
              even years. Of course, the actual material constituting the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>&#8212;the 
              water&#8212;is replaced in milliseconds. The same is true for Ray 
              Kurzweil. Like the water in a stream, my <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s are constantly 
              changing, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that people recognize as Ray has a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able 
              level of continuity. This argues that we should not associate our 
              fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> with a specific <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, but rather 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that we represent. Many contemporary 
              philosophers seem partial to this &#8220;identify from <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>&#8221; 
              argument. </p>
<p>But wait. If you were to scan my <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and reinstantiate new Ray 
              while I was sleeping, I would not necessarily even know about it 
              (with the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, this will be a feasible scenario). If you then 
              come to me, and say, &#8220;Good news, Ray, we&#8217;ve successfully 
              reinstantiated your <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>, so we won&#8217;t be needing your 
              old <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> anymore,&#8221; I may suddenly realize the flaw in the 
              &#8220;identity from <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>&#8221; argument. I may wish new Ray well, 
              and realize that he shares my &#8220;pattern,&#8221; but I would nonetheless 
              conclude that he&#8217;s not me, because I&#8217;m still here. How 
              could he be me? After all, I would not necessarily know that he 
              even existed. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider another perplexing scenario. Suppose I replace 
              a small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s with functionally equivalent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> ones (they may provide certain benefits such as greater 
              reliability and longevity, but that&#8217;s not relevant to this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>). After I have this procedure performed, am I 
              still the same person? My friends certainly think so. I still have 
              the same self-deprecating <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>, the same silly grin&#8212;yes, I&#8217;m 
              still the same guy. </p>
<p>It should be clear where I&#8217;m going with this. <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">Bit</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>, 
              region by region, I ultimately replace my entire <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with essentially 
              identical (perhaps improved) <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> equivalents (preserving 
              all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations and other details that 
              represent my <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, skills, and memories). At each point, I feel 
              the procedures were successful. At each point, I feel that I am 
              same guy. After each procedure, I claim to be the same guy. My friends 
              concur. There is no old Ray and new Ray, just one Ray, one that 
              never appears to fundamentally change. </p>
<p>But consider this. This gradual replacement of my <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> equivalent is essentially identical to the following 
              sequence: (i) scan Ray and reinstantiate Ray&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a> into 
              new (<a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>) Ray, and, then (ii) terminate old Ray. But we 
              concluded above that in such a scenario new Ray is not the same 
              as old Ray. And if old Ray is terminated, well then that&#8217;s 
              the end of Ray. So the gradual replacement scenario essentially 
              results in the same result: New Ray has been created, and old Ray 
              has been terminated, even if we never saw him missing. So what appears 
              to be the continuing <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of just one Ray is really the creation 
              of new Ray and the end of old Ray. </p>
<p>On yet another hand (we&#8217;re running out of philosophical hands 
              here), the gradual replacement scenario is not altogether different 
              from what happens normally to our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> selves, in that our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s are always rapidly being replaced. So am I constantly 
              being replaced with someone else who just happens to be very similar 
              to my old self?</p>
<p>I am trying to illustrate why <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is not an easy issue. 
              If we talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as just a certain type of intelligent 
              skill: the ability to reflect on one&#8217;s own self and situation, 
              for example, then the issue is not difficult at all because any 
              skill or capability or form of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that one cares to define 
              will be replicated in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s) within 
              a few decades. With this type of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive view of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, 
              the conundrums do go away. But a fully <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive view does not penetrate 
              to the core of the issue, because the essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>, not <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive correlates of that <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Will these <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s be capable of having <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s?</p>
<p>They certainly will claim to. They will claim to be people, and 
              to have the full range of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s that 
              people claim to have. And these will not be idle claims; they will 
              evidence the sort of rich, complex, and subtle behavior one associates 
              with these feelings. How do the claims and behaviors&#8212;compelling 
              as they will be&#8212;relate to the <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of these 
              reinstantiated people? We keep coming back to the very real but 
              ultimately unmeasurable issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. </p>
<p>People often talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as if it were a clear property 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that can readily be identified, detected, and gauged. 
              If there is one crucial insight that we can make regarding why the 
              issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is so <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious, it is the following: </p>
<p>There exists no <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive test that can absolutely determine its 
              presence. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> is about <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive measurement and logical implications 
              therefrom, but the very <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ivity is that you cannot 
              measure <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>&#8212;you can only measure correlates 
              of it, such as behavior (and by behavior, I include the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s). This limitation has 
              to do with the very <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s &#8220;objective&#8221; 
              and &#8220;subjective.&#8221; Fundamentally, we cannot penetrate the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of another <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> with direct <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive measurement. 
              We can certainly make arguments about it: i.e., &#8220;look inside 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of this nonhuman <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, see how its <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s are just 
              like a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#8221; Or, &#8220;see how its behavior is just 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior.&#8221; But in the end, these remain just arguments. 
              No <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how convincing the behavior of a reinstantiated person, 
              some observers will refuse to accept the <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> 
              unless it squirts <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s, or is based on <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-guided <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, or has some other specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>. 
            </p>
<p>We assume that other humans are conscious, but that is still an 
              assumption, and there is no consensus amongst humans about the <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              of nonhuman entities, such as other higher non-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. The 
              issue will be even more <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious with regard to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> 
              entities with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like behavior and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. </p>
<p>From a practical perspective, we&#8217;ll accept their claims. Keep 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities in the twenty-first century 
              will be extremely intelligent, so they&#8217;ll be able to convince 
              us that they are conscious. They&#8217;ll have all the subtle cues 
              that convince us today that humans are conscious. They will be able 
              to make us laugh and cry. And they&#8217;ll get mad if we don&#8217;t 
              accept their claims. But this is a political prediction, not a philosophical 
              argument.</p>

<h2>On Tubules and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">Quantum Computing</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past several years, <a class="thought" href="entries/penrose_entry.html">Roger Penrose</a>, a noted physicist and 
              philosopher, has suggested that fine <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s called 
              tubules perform an exotic form of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> called &#8220;quantum 
              computing.&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">Quantum computing</a> is computing using what are known 
              as &#8220;qu bits,&#8221; which take on all possible combinations 
              of solutions simultaneously. It can be considered to be an extreme 
              form of <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a> (because every combination of values 
              of the qu bits is tested simultaneously). Penrose suggests that 
              the tubules and their <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> capabilities complicate 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of recreating <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and reinstantiating <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>s. 
            </p>
<p>However, there is little to suggest that the tubules contribute 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process. Even generous models of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              and capability are more than accounted for by current estimates 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> size, based on contemporary models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> functioning 
              that do not include tubules. In fact, even with these tubule-less 
              models, it appears that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is conservatively designed with 
              many more connections (by several orders of magnitude) than it needs 
              for its capabilities and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. Recent <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s (e.g., the 
              San Diego Institute for Nonlinear <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s) showing that 
              hybrid <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s perform similarly to all 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, while not definitive, are strongly suggestive 
              that our tubule-less models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> functioning are adequate. 
            </p>
<p>However, even if the tubules are <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant, it doesn&#8217;t change 
              the projections I have discussed above to any significant degree. 
              According to my model of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, if the tubules multiplied 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> by a factor of a thousand (and keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that 
              our current tubule-less <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> models are already complex, including 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a thousand connections per <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, multiple nonlinearities 
              and other details), this would delay our reaching <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              by only about nine years. If we&#8217;re off by a factor of a million, 
              that&#8217;s still only a delay of 17 years. A factor of a billion 
              is around 24 years (keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is growing by a double 
              exponential). </p>
<p>With regard to <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, once again there is nothing to 
              suggest that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. Just because quantum 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> may be feasible does not suggest that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is capable 
              of it. We don&#8217;t have lasers or even radios in our brains either. 
              No one has suggested <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capabilities that would require a <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>.</p>
<p>However, even if the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does do <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, this does 
              not significantly change the outlook for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level computing (and 
              beyond) nor does it suggest that <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing is infeasible. 
              First of all, if the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does do <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> this would 
              only verify that <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> is feasible. There would be nothing 
              in such a finding to suggest that <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> is restricted 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mechanisms. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> mechanisms, 
              if they exist, could be replicated. Indeed, recent <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s with 
              small-scale quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s appear to be successful. </p>
<p>Penrose suggests that it is impossible to perfectly replicate a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of quantum states, so therefore, perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing is impossible. 
              Well, how perfect does a <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> have to be? I am at this moment 
              in a very different quantum state (and different in non-quantum 
              ways as well) than I was a minute ago (certainly in a different 
              state than I was before I wrote this paragraph). If we develop <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to the point where the &#8220;copies&#8221; are as close 
              to the original as the original person changes anyway in the course 
              of one minute, that would be good enough for any conceivable purpose, 
              yet does not require copying quantum states. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> improves, 
              the accuracy of the copy could become as close as the original changes 
              within ever-briefer periods of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (e.g., one second, one millisecond). 
            </p>
<p>When it was pointed out to Penrose that <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (and even neural 
              connections) were too big for <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, he came up with 
              the tubule theory as a possible mechanism for neural <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. 
              So the concerns with <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> and tubules have been introduced 
              together. If one is <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for barriers to replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              function, it is an ingenious theory, but it fails to introduce any 
              genuine barriers. There is no evidence for it, and even if true, 
              it only delays <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s by a decade or two. There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to

<p>How will we apply <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that is more intelligent than its 
              creators? One might be tempted to respond &#8220;Carefully!&#8221; 
              But let&#8217;s take a look at some examples.</p>
<p>Consider several examples of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which, based 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> and cost <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> trends, will be feasible within 
              30 years. In addition to scanning your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will 
              also be able to expand your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will provide fully immersive, totally convincing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> in the following way. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s take up positions 
              in close physical proximity to every interneuronal connection coming 
              from all of our senses (e.g., eyes, ears, skin). We already have 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to communicate with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s 
              in both directions that requires no direct physical contact with 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. For example, scientists at the <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> Institute 
              have developed &#8220;neuron <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s&#8221; that can detect the 
              firing of a nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, or alternatively, can cause a nearby 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to fire, or suppress it from firing. This amounts to two-way 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. 
              The Institute scientists demonstrated their <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> by controlling 
              the movement of a living leech from their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Again, the primary 
              aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> that is not yet feasible 
              is size and cost. </p>
<p>When we want to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> real <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s just stay 
              in position (in the capillaries) and do nothing. If we want to enter 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they suppress all of the inputs coming from the 
              real senses, and replace them with the signals that would be appropriate 
              for the virtual environment. You (i.e., your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>) could decide 
              to cause your muscles and limbs to move as you normally would, but 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s again intercept these interneuronal signals, suppress 
              your real limbs from moving, and instead cause your virtual limbs 
              to move and provide the appropriate movement and reorientation in 
              the virtual environment. </p>
<p>The web will provide a panoply of virtual environments to explore. 
              Some will be recreations of real places; others will be fanciful 
              environments that have no &#8220;real&#8221; counterpart. Some indeed 
              would be impossible in the physical world (perhaps, because they 
              violate the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>). We will be able to &#8220;go&#8221; 
              to these virtual environments by ourselves, or we will meet other 
              people there, both real people and simulated people. Of course, 
              ultimately there won&#8217;t be a clear distinction between the two. 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be able to expand our minds in virtually 
              any imaginable way. Our brains today are relatively fixed in design. 
              Although we do add <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of interneuronal connections and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> 
              concentrations as a normal part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process, the current 
              overall <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is highly constrained, restricted 
              to a mere hundred trillion connections. <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> implants based on 
              massively distributed intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will ultimately expand 
              our memories a trillion fold, and otherwise vastly improve all of 
              our sensory, <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> and cognitive abilities. Since 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s are communicating with each other over a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> local 
              area <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, they can create any <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of new neural connections, 
              can break existing connections (by suppressing neural firing), can 
              create new hybrid <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s as well as adding 
              vast new <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. </p>
<p>Using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s as <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> extenders is a significant improvement 
              over the idea of surgically installed <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s, which are 
              beginning to be used today. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a>s will be introduced without 
              surgery, essentially just by injecting or even swallowing them. 
              They can all be directed to leave, so the process is easily reversible. 
              They are <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable, in that they can provide <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> 
              one minute, and a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> extensions the next. They can 
              change their <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>, and clearly can alter their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. 
              Perhaps most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, they are massively distributed and therefore 
              can take up billions or trillions of positions throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              whereas a surgically introduced <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a> can only be placed 
              in one or at most a few locations. </p>

<h2>A Clear and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Danger</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> has always been a double-edged sword, bringing us longer 
              and healthier <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spans, <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> from physical and mental drudgery, 
              and many new creative possibilities on the one hand, while introducing 
              new and <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> dangers on the other. We still live today with sufficient 
              nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s (not all of which appear to be well accounted for) 
              to end all <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">Bioengineering</a> is in the 
              early stages of enormous strides in reversing <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and aging 
              processes. However, the means and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> exist in a routine college 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> lab to create unfriendly <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s more dangerous 
              than nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s. For the twenty-first century, we will see 
              the same intertwined potentials: a great feast of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> resulting 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> expanded a trillion-fold combined with many 
              grave new dangers. </p>
<p>Consider unrestrained <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> replication. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> requires 
              billions or trillions of such intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to be useful. 
              The most cost-effective way to scale up to such levels is through 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, essentially the same approach used in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              world. And in the same way that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> gone 
              awry (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>) results in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> destruction, a defect 
              in the mechanism curtailing <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> would endanger 
              all physical entities, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> or otherwise. </p>
<p>Other <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> concerns include &#8220;who is controlling the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s?&#8221; 
              and &#8220;who are the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s talking to?&#8221; Organizations (e.g., 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, extremist groups) or just a clever <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> could 
              put trillions of undetectable <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in the water or food supply 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> or of an entire population. These &#8220;spy&#8221; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s could then monitor, influence, and even control our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. In addition to introducing physical spy <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, existing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s could be influenced through <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses and other 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> &#8220;hacking&#8221; techniques. </p>
<p>My own expectation is that the creative and constructive applications 
              of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will dominate, as I believe they do today. But 
              there will be a valuable (and increasingly vocal) role for a concerned 
              and constructive Luddite movement (i.e., anti-technologists inspired 
              by early nineteenth century weavers who destroyed labor-saving <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry 
              in protest). </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Living Forever</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Once <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> porting <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been refined and fully developed, 
              will this enable us to live forever? The answer depends on what 
              we mean by living and dying. Consider what we do today with our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> files. When we change from one <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> 
              to a less obsolete model, we don&#8217;t throw all our files away; 
              rather we copy them over to the new <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. Although our <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              files do not necessary continue their <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> forever, the longevity 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is completely separate and disconnected 
              from the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> that it runs on. When it comes to our personal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>, however, when our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> crashes, the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              of our lives dies with it. However, this will not continue to be 
              the case when we have the means to store and restore the thousands 
              of trillions of bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> stored and represented in our 
              brains. </p>
<p>The longevity of one&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a> will not be dependent, therefore, 
              on the continued viability of any particular <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> medium. Ultimately 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-based humans, albeit vastly extended beyond the severe 
              limitations of humans as we know them today, will live out on the 
              web, projecting bodies whenever they need or want them, including 
              virtual bodies in diverse realms of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, holographically 
              projected bodies, and physical bodies comprised of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> swarms, 
              and other forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. </p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> will be free, therefore, from the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              of any particular <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> medium. Today, we are each confined to 
              a mere hundred trillion connections, but humans at the end of the 
              twenty-first century can grow their <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s without 
              limit. We may regard this as a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>, although it 
              is worth pointing out that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> do not necessarily 
              last forever. Although not dependent on the viability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> 
              it runs on, the longevity of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> depends on its relevance, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ibility. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to retrieve 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from an obsolete form of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> storage in an old obscure 
              format (e.g., a reel of magnetic tape from a 1970 <a class="thought" href="entries/minicomputer_entry.html">minicomputer</a>), 
              you will understand the challenges in keeping <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viable. However, 
              if we are diligent in maintaining our <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>, keeping current 
              backups, and porting to current formats and mediums, then a form 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> can be attained, at least for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-based humans. 
              Our <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>&#8212;our personality, skills, memories&#8212;all of 
              that is lost today when our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> crashes. When we 
              can <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, store, and restore that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, then its longevity 
              will no longer be tied to <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> permanence. </p>
<p>Is this form of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> the same <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> as a physical <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, 
              as we know them today, living forever? In one <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> it is, because 
              as I pointed out earlier, we are not a constant collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. 
              Only our <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> persists, and even that gradually 
              changes. Similarly, it will be the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> that 
              persists and develops and changes gradually. </p>
<p>But is that person based on my <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>, who migrates across many 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s, and who outlives any particular <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              medium, really me? We come back to the same questions of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, issues that have been debated since the Platonic dialogues. 
              As we go through the twenty-first century, these will not remain 
              polite philosophical debates, but will be confronted as vital and 
              practical issues. </p>
<p>A related question is, &#8220;Is <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> desirable?&#8221; A great 
              deal of our effort goes into avoiding it. We make extraordinary 
              efforts to delay it, and indeed often consider its intrusion a tragic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. Yet we might find it hard to live without it. We consider 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> as giving meaning to our lives. It gives <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance and value 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> could become meaningless if there were too much of 
              it.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Next Step in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>But I regard the freeing of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> from its severe physical 
              limitations of scope and duration as the necessary next step in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>, in my view, represents the purpose of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. 
              That is, the purpose of life&#8212;and of our lives&#8212;is to evolve. 
            </p>
<p>What does it mean to evolve? <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> moves towards greater <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, 
              greater elegance, greater <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, greater <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, greater 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>, greater <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, greater <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>. And <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> has been called 
              all these things, only without any limitation: infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, 
              infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>, infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, and 
              infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> does not achieve an infinite level, but 
              as it explodes exponentially, it certainly moves in that direction. 
              So <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> moves inexorably towards our <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, albeit 
              never reaching this ideal. Thus the freeing of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> from 
              the severe limitations of its <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> form may be regarded as 
              an essential <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual quest. </p>
<p> In making this statement, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to emphasize that terms 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, destiny, and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual quest are observations about 
              the end result, not justifications for it. I am not saying that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will evolve to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels and beyond simply because 
              it is our destiny and the satisfaction of a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual quest. Rather 
              my projections result from a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology based the <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> underlying 
              the (double) <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of technological processes. The 
              primary force driving <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is economic imperative. We are 
              moving towards <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (and beyond) 
              as the result of millions of advances, each with their own economic 
              justification. To use an example from my own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> at one of 
              my companies (Kurzweil Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>), whenever we came up 
              with a slightly more intelligent version of speech recognition, 
              the new version invariably had greater value than the earlier generation 
              and, as a result, sales increased. It is interesting to note that 
              in the example of speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the three primary 
              surviving competitors (Kurzweil&#8212;now Lernout &amp; Hauspie, 
              Dragon, and <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>) stayed very close to each other in the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. A few other companies that failed to do so (e.g., 
              Speech <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s) went out of business. At any point in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we would 
              be able to sell the version prior to the latest version for perhaps 
              a quarter of the price of the current version. As for versions of 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that were two generations old, we couldn&#8217;t even 
              give those away. This <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> is not only true for <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> 
              and other &#8220;AI&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. It&#8217;s true of any product 
              from cars to bread makers. And if the product itself doesn&#8217;t 
              exhibit some level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, then <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the manufacturing 
              and marketing <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s have a major effect on the success and profitability 
              of an enterprise. </p>
<p>There is a vital economic imperative to create more intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have enormous value. That is why 
              they are being built. There are tens of thousands of projects that 
              are advancing intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in many diverse ways. The support 
              for &#8220;high tech&#8221; in the business community (mostly <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>) 
              has grown enormously. When I started my <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> and speech <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> 
              company in 1974, the total U.S. annual <a class="thought" href="entries/venture_capital_entry.html">venture capital</a> investment 
              in high tech was around $8 million. Total high tech IPOs for 1974 
              was about the same figure. Today, high tech IPOs (principally <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>) 
              are about $30 million per day, more than a thousand fold increase. 
            </p>
<p>We will continue to build more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al mechanisms 
              because it creates enormous value. We will reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> not because it is our destiny, but because there is 
              valuable <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to be found there that will provide insights 
              in building more intelligent (and more valuable) <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. We would 
              have to repeal <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> and every visage of economic competition 
              to stop this <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion.</p>
<p>By the second half of this twenty-first century, there will be 
              no clear distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. On 
              the one hand, we will have <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brains vastly expanded through 
              distributed <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based implants. On the other hand, we will have 
              fully <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> brains that are copies of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains, albeit 
              also vastly extended. And we will have myriad other varieties of 
              intimate connection between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> it 
              has fostered. </p>
<p>Ultimately, <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will dominate because it 
              is growing at a double exponential rate, whereas for all practical 
              purposes <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is at a standstill. By the end 
              of the twenty-first century, <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> will be trillions 
              of trillions of times more powerful than that of its <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              progenitors, although still of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> origin. It will continue to 
              be the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> taking the next step in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Before the twenty-first century is over, the Earth&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> will <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with its <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. After all, 
              what is the difference between a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> enhanced a trillion 
              fold by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based implants, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> whose design is based 
              on high resolution scans of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and then extended a 
              trillion-fold? </p>
<p>Most forecasts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> seem to ignore the revolutionary impact 
              of the inevitable emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that match and ultimately

              that will be no less <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant than the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'm still a bit surprised why Ray continues to equate gradual replacement with making copy of Ray's mind file, concluding with the termination of the original Ray. Gradual replacement might be equivalent to acquiring new skills but not to the creation of a perfect twin since Ray1 is terminated after Ray2 is born so there is some time between while both Rays exist. Gradual replacement happens when we learn something or destroy old habbits. Are we really destroying ourselves or our identity through this process?

Well, I'm not the same person I was when I was a five year old boy. I can no longer enjoy the silly cartoons I watched as a child, they bore me. I no longer believe the same things. Yet, that boy is still part of me, I have a few of his memories, vague memories of the cartoons watched, friends from my first school days... but most of that life as a five year old is lost to me. I've dumped it in the process of growing up.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Mr. Kerzweil, it appears, equates the 'evolution of the mind' with the 'evolution of technology'. He then suggests that the observed historical pattern of exponential growth in technology, can/will be continued by 1)artificial increases in computing power, and 2)by an understanding or reverse engineering of the human brain. IMO, this article does an excellent job of attempting to fill in details around what is a very interesting concept. 
<br>
<br>
The concept of equating the 'evolution of the human mind' with the 'evolution of technology' is important and useful. Technology is, at the very least, a very important manifestation of the human mind. If one is ever to model, simulate, or explain the evolution of the human mind, one must be able to model, simulate and explain the exponential growth in technology. 
<br>
<br>
It is interesting to note that the increases or evolution in technology are continuing despite the fact that there is no evidence for any corresponding changes in the genetic make-up of the human species. As far as I am aware, there is no other example of a key characteristic of a biological system which has continued to evolve at a 'rapid and accelerating pace' despite the lack of genetic change. 
<br>
<br>
In explaining this very unusual phenomena, it is useful to start by noting that technology is not the product of a single brain, but the product of cooperation among large groups of brains.  It is, in fact, reasonable to argue that 'the evolution of the mind' is much more closely associated with 'the evolution of increases in the ability to perform cooperative thinking or analysis' than it is with 'increases in the computing capacity of the brain'. The increase in brain size from pre-human to human was probably rather slight. The increase in 'the ability to generate technology and cultural artifacts' was huge. 
<br>
<br>
If technology and cultural artifacts are the product produced by 'human intelligence', then understanding human intelligence is likely to have more to do with understanding how people work together and solve problems cooperatively, than with understanding how individual brains function. 
<br>
<br>
SUMMARY
<br>
Mr. Kurzweil does an excellent job, IMO, of attempting to extrapolate and explain future technological advances in terms of hardware, software and human/artificial intelligence. I would only suggest that it might be more productive to look at 'human social interactions' rather than the 'human brain' in order to identify the relevant software/source of intelligence.

<br>
<br>
Thomas argues, that when a Super-AI has "matured" (Friendly or not), the sum of human knowledge might seem a trivial bit.
<br>
<br>
This view seems plausible, but then one has to wonder what exactly is being measured by the term "knowledge".
<br>
<br>
If (suppose) all the "laws of physics and the universe" could be described in, say, one megabyte of information (perhaps less), then my Palm Pilot could effectively "know everything, in principle".  But that (simply, storage) is not a very useful application of these "rules".
<br>
<br>
Suppose we (humans, earth-stuff) just happen to be the only intelligent life in the universe.  In this case, we are the ones that have created most knowledge.  Not "discovered", but CREATED, as in "Mozart created symphonies, not discovered them".  Sure, one can call the "precise location of every dust-mote in space" a lot of "information", but not terribly elucidating as "knowledge".
<br>
<br>
Thus, I argue that indeed scanning the internet, human (and other) brains will be the "bulk" of knowledge an AI will accumulate.  Thereafter, it may create additional knowledge in the relationships between things, and the creation of entirely new things.  But I don't see that there is really that much additional "knowledge" (useful new factoids), in terms of storage size, that would significantly increase the AI's "intellectual capabilities".
<br>
<br>
And certainly, "on the road to a strong AI", accumulation of information via the Internet would prove valuable.
<br>
<br>
I have to wonder, though, when something has that much information at its fingertips (and the intelligence to understand its relations and implications), whether it is fair to call this entity an "it" (or a "ver"), in the singular sense.  Would it instead fragment into an AI-community of interacting agents, out of pure efficiency considerations?
<br>

<br>
<br>
A few more things to ponder. You may choose to believe the story of the "Tower of Babel" or not but what we are doing in creating AI is pretty much the same thing. In that biblical story God worried that humans were going to become too smart and decided to "scatter" them around the globe. The Internet has virtually removed this scatter effect and now we are able to communicate with any person that has an Internet connection.
<br>
<br>
If we create an internetworked community of SAI - sharing information with one another via wireless LAN there is no telling what this "army" could be capable of. 
<br>
<br>
This might sound a lot like the Matrix but I think there are a lot of insights in that movie into the worse case scenario(s).</p></td>

<br>
<br>
I know that a lot of the web is nonsense-data, but that will not matter to even a mediocre AI that can access and correlate the body of it.
<br>
<br>
Its like interrogating a dozen suspects separately ... they try to keep their stories straight, but you find various inconsistencies and can determine the real story in general, and where there remains real ambiguity, you know just where you need to investigate further for sources that will serve to disambiguate those parts.
<br>
<br>
That is why I am not terribly worried about hate-sites, or Elvis-sightings, etc.  A sufficient AI will have gleaned enough from psychology texts to recognize the human tendency for fallacies.
<br>
<br>
(Indeed, short of "Strong-Super-AI", I think a real boon in the short-term would be precisely to develop an AI that can scan millions of web and news listings, perform auto-correlations and time analyses, and then tell you, "This is true, this is spin, this is bunk, and if you want to know how I can to this conclusion, just ask."  Everyone should have their own personal "AI-Investigator", rather than rely upon the mainstream media.)
<br>
<br>
I also agree, that a strong-AI will end up quickly "hacking" into every location where information is kept.  You won't keep secrets from a super-AI.
<br>
<br>
The Tower of Babel is interesting.  It represents to me the "revelation" ;) that language evolves, and unless you have a rather tight-knit community to "co-evolve" the language, that language will split and diverge.  The internet can sole "some" of that tendency, as far as common language is concerned.
<br>
<br>
But another aspect is one of specialization.  There are far more areas of mathematics than any mathematician can master today.  There are far more areas of medicine than any single physician can master today, etc.  Even if all information could be "accessed and shared instantly", it cannot really help me to "understand" the import of it all.  I could not comprehend it all, and use it, even if I could access it.  That is another kind of Tower of Babel.
<br>
<br>
I have to wonder whether "Super-AI" would remain "singular" in that regard, being (as it were) "one mind" holding and relating all this information, or whether it would evolve out of necessity into a collective of cooperating (or competing) minds, each with their own evolving specialties (and their own agendas).  The original "Seed-AI", as it grew, might want to avoid such a fate out of concern for stability and control, but to do so might require it to limit its own size and capability.
<br>
<br>
Interesting areas to explore.
<br>
