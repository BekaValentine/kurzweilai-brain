<a class="thought" href="entries/laws_of_thermodynamics_entry.html">Laws of thermodynamics</a> The <a class="thought" href="entries/laws_of_thermodynamics_entry.html">laws of thermodynamics</a> govern how and why <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is transferred.</p>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics (postulated by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847), also called the Law of Conservation of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a>, states that the total amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> is constant. A process may modify the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, but a <a class="thought" href="entries/closed_system_entry.html">closed system</a> does not lose <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. We can use this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to determine the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, the amount lost as waste heat, and the efficiency of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics (articulated by Rudolf Clausias in 1850), also known as the Law of Increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">Entropy</a>, states that the <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> (disorder of particles) in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> never decreases. As the disorder in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> increases, the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is transformed into less usable forms. Thus, the efficiency of any process will always be less than 100 percent.</p>
<p>The third law of thermodynamics (described by Walter Hermann Nernst in 1906, based on the idea of a temperature of <a class="thought" href="entries/absolute_zero_entry.html">absolute zero</a> first articulated by Baron Kelvin in 1848), also known as the Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/absolute_zero_entry.html">Absolute Zero</a>, tells us that all molecular movement stops at a temperature called <a class="thought" href="entries/absolute_zero_entry.html">absolute zero</a>, or 0 Kelvin (2273&#176;<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>).

<a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_entanglement_entry.html">Quantum entanglement</a> A relationship between two physically separated particles under special circumstances. Two photons may be "quantum entangled" if produced by the same <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> interaction and emerging in opposite directions. The two photons remain quantum entangled with each other even when separated by very large distances (even when light-years apart). In such a circumstance, the two quantum entangled photons, if each forced to make a decision to choose among two equally probable pathways, will make the identical decision and will do so at the same instant in time. Since there is no possible <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> link between two quantum entangled photons, classical <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> would predict that their decisions would be independent. But two quantum entangled photons make the same decision and do so at the same instant in time. Experiments have demonstrated that even if there were an unknown <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> path between them, there is not enough time for a message to travel from one <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> to the other at the speed of light.</p>

<a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> A simulated environment in which you can immerse yourself. A <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment provides a convincing replacement for the visual and auditory senses, and (by 2019) the tactile sense. In later decades, the olfactory sense will be included as well. The key to a realistic visual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> is that when you move your head, the scene instantly repositions itself so that you are now looking at a different region of a three-dimensional scene. The intention is to simulate what happens when you turn your real head in the real world: The images captured by your retinas rapidly change. Your brain nonetheless understands that the world has remained stationary and that the image is sliding across your retinas only because your head is rotating. Initially, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> (including crude contemporary systems) requires the use of special helmets to provide the visual and auditory environments. By 2019, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will be provided by ubiquitous contact-lens-based systems and implanted retinal-imaging devices (as well as comparable devices for auditory "imaging"). Later in the twenty-first century, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> (which will include all the senses) will be provided by direct stimulation of nerve pathways using neural implants.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I am fascinated by what i am reading on this site and will continue to absorb information.However my interest lies (as a musician) with making music and wondered if Mr.Kurzweil has been thinking in having his respected input in synths lately or perhaps in software for making music ie;sounds,recording,mixing and the like.
<br>
<br>
I am still very fond of his unique K250 synth and nothing will ever look like it,sound like it or last like it!!
<br>
<br>
So anything he does in future in relation(first of all) to music i would like to know.
<br>

Please send him my warmest regards,

Concerning music: Ray's "The Brain" will lead you to a few articles. I'm sure you've already seen a few. You can ask Ramona, too - but you won't get very far yet, I'm afraid.
<br>
<br>
Punch the "search" function at the top of this page to search Mind-X for threads on music, as we've had a few. Some have covered music technology (mostly speculative future-stuffs) and some concerning composition &amp; theory (which got a little bizarre).
<br>
<br>
Ray mostly plays around with Ramona, though his boys do a bit of programming for computer-based composition. I'd like to see a little more concerning speculation on future directions and developments in music as well. Perhaps you'd like to speculate a bit to get the ball rolling?

<br>
Well if that isn't a clue to something, I don't know what is. 300 things occuring 300 000 does not sound meaningless. What a lame thing to say. 'Meaning unknown' would be more correct. You cannot proove 'meaningless'.

<br>
<br>
PMID# 9694261 -
<br>
<br>
"Alu elements are a family of short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) found exclusively in primates. These elements are around 300 base pairs long, are found in excess of one million copies per diploid genome, and are dispersed throughout the human genome. Alu elements are scattered by a mechanism called "retrotransposition". Three independent steps are involved in retrotransposition: transcription of the Alu repetitive element, reverse transcription of the Alu RNA and integration of the Alu cDNA. The fact that Alu elements retrotranspose so readily suggests that they have a myriad of effects on the genome, mostly by inactivating genes or altering their function. These characteristics of Alu repetitive elements point to these repetitive DNA fragments as a major driving force for evolution. In addition, Alu elements are &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;known to adopt diverse functions depending on the context&lt;&lt;&lt; of the surrounding genetic material into which they insert...." 
<br>
<br>
So, Ray... at first glance this repeative sequence - 300bps long - seems meaningless or more precisely purposeless but in fact it's a contextually driven self-regulating (sub)system.

I am starting to wonder what this site is really about. ;)</p></td>
