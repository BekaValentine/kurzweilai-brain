<br><blockquote>Think of the design process as involving first the generation of alternatives and then the testing of these alternatives against a whole array of requirements and constraints.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERBERT A. SIMON</blockquote>
<p>MOLECULAR <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">ASSEMBLER</a>S will bring a revolution without parallel since the development of ribosomes, the primitive <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. The resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>can help <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spread beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> - a step without parallel since <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spread beyond the seas. It can help mind emerge in <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s - a step without parallel since mind emerged in primates. And it can let our minds renew and remake our bodies - a step without any parallel at all.</p>
<p>&#160;These revolutions will bring dangers and opportunities too vast for the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> imagination to grasp. Yet the principles of change that have applied to <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, cells, beasts, minds, and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s should endure even in an age of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, nanomachines, and artificial minds. The same principles that have applied at sea, on land, and in the air should endure as we spread <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> toward the stars. Understanding the enduring principles of change will help us understand the potential for good and ill in the new technologies. &#160;</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">Chaos</a></h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a> can emerge from <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> without anyone's giving orders: orderly crystals condensed from formless interstellar gas long before Sun, <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> appeared.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">Chaos</a> also gives rise to a crystalline <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> under more familiar circumstances. Imagine a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> - perhaps regular in form, or perhaps lopsided and knobby like a <a class="thought" href="entries/ginger_entry.html">ginger</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a>. Now imagine a vast number of such <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s moving randomly in a liquid, tumbling and jostling like drunkards in weightlessness in the dark. Imagine the liquid evaporating and cooling, forcing the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s closer together and slowing them down. Will these randomly moving, oddly shaped <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s simply gather in disordered heaps? Generally not. They will usually settle into a crystalline pattern, each neatly nestled against its neighbors, forming rows and columns as perfect as a checkerboard, though often more complex.</p>
<p>&#160;This process involves neither magic nor some special property of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and quantum mechanical forces. It does not even require the special matching shapes that enable <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to self-assemble into <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Marbles of uniform size, if placed in a tray and shaken, also settle into a regular pattern.</p>
<p>&#160;Crystals grow by trial and the removal of error, by variation and selection. No tiny hands assemble them. A crystal can begin with a chance clumping of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s: the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s wander, bump, and clump at random, but clumps stick best when packed in the right crystalline pattern. Other <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s then strike this first, tiny crystal. Some bump in the wrong position or orientation; they stick poorly and shake loose again. Others happen to bump properly; they stick better and often stay. Layer builds on layer, extending the crystalline pattern. Though the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s bump at random, they do not stick at random. <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a> grows from <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> through variation and selection. &#160;</p><h1>Evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">Molecule</a>s</h1><p>In crystal <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, each layer forms a template for the next. Uniform layers accumulate to form a solid block.</p>
<p>&#160;In cells, strands of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> can serve as templates too, aided by enzymes that act as molecular copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. But the subunits of nucleic acid strands can be arranged in many different sequences, and a template strand can separate from its copy. Both strand and copy can then be copied again. Biochemist Sol Spiegelman has used a copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> from a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>) in test tube experiments. In a simple, lifeless environment, it duplicates <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Picture a strand of <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> floating in a test tube together with copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> subunits. The strand tumbles and writhes until it bumps into a copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in the right position to stick. Subunits bump around until one of the right kind meets the copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in the right position to match the template strand. As matching subunits chance to fall into position, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> seizes them and bonds them to the growing copy; though subunits bump randomly, the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> bonds selectively. Finally the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, the template, and the copy separate.</p>
<p>&#160;In the terminology of Oxford zoologist <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a>, things that give rise to copies of themselves are called <i>replicators</i>. In this environment, <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s qualify: a single <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> soon becomes two, then four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and so forth, multiplying exponentially. Later, the replication rate levels off: the fixed stock of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can churn out <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> copies only so fast, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how many template <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s vie for their services. Later still, the raw materials for making <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s become scarce and replication starves to a halt. The exploding population of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s reaches a limit to <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and stops reproducing.</p>
<p>&#160;The copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, however, often miscopy an <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> strand, inserting, deleting, or mismatching a subunit. The resulting mutated strand then differs in length or subunit sequence. Such changes are fairly random, and changes accumulate as miscopied <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are again miscopied. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s proliferate, they begin to grow different from their ancestors and from each other. This might seem a recipe for <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists have found that differing <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s replicate at differing rates, depending on their lengths and subunit patterns. Descendants of the swifter replicators naturally grow more common. Indeed, if one kind replicates just 10 percent more rapidly than its siblings, then after one hundred generations, each of the faster kind gives rise to 1,000 times as many descendants. Small differences in <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> pile up exponentially.</p>
<p>&#160;When a test tube runs out of subunits, an experimenter can sample its <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> and "infect" a fresh tube. The process begins again and the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that dominated the first round of competition begin with a head start. More small changes appear, building over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> into large changes. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s replicate faster, and their kind dominates the mix. When resources run out, the experimenter can sample the <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> and start again (and again, and again), holding conditions stable.</p>
<p>&#160;This experiment reveals a natural process: no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> sequences the experimenter starts with, the seeming <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> of random errors and biased copying brings forth one kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> (give or take some copying errors). Its typical version has a known, well-defined sequence of 220 subunits. It is the best <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> replicator in this environment, so it crowds out the others and stays. &#160;</p>
<p>Prolonged copying, miscopying, and competition always bring about the same result, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what the length or pattern of the <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> that starts the process. Though no one could have predicted this winning pattern, anyone can see that change and competition will tend to bring forth a single winner. Little else could happen in so simple a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. If these replicators affected one another strongly (perhaps by selectively attacking or helping one another), then the result could resemble a more complex <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>. As it is, they just compete for a resource.</p>
<p>&#160;A variation on this example shows us something else: <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s adapt differently to different environments. A molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> called a ribonuclease grabs <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s having certain sequences of exposed subunits and cuts them in two. But <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, like <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, fold in patterns that depend on their sequences, and by folding the right way they can protect their vulnerable spots. Experimenters find that <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s evolve to sacrifice swift replication for better protection when ribonuclease is around. Again, a best competitor emerges.</p>
<p>&#160;Notice that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> terms have crept into this description: since the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s replicate, the word "generation" seems right; <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s "descended" from a common "ancestor" are "relatives," and the words "<a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>," "reproduction," "mutation," and "competition" also seem right. Why is this? Because these <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s copy themselves with small variations, as do the genes of living organisms. When varying replicators have varying successes, the more successful tend to accumulate. This process, wherever it occurs, is "<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>." &#160;</p>
<p>In this test tube example we can see <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> stripped to its bare essentials, free of the <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al controversy surrounding the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> replicators and <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are well-defined collections of atoms obeying well-understood principles and evolving in repeatable laboratory conditions. Biochemists can make <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> from off-the-shelf chemicals, without help from <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists borrow these copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s from a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> that infects <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> and uses <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> as its genetic material. These viruses survive by entering a bacterium, getting themselves copied using its resources, and then escaping to infect new <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. Miscopying of viral <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> produces mutant viruses, and viruses that replicate more successfully grow more common; this is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by natural selection, apparently called "natural" because it involves nonhuman parts of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. But unlike the test tube <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, viral <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> must do more than just replicate itself as a bare <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>, Successful viral <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> must also direct <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l ribosomes to build <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that let it first escape from the old bacterium, then survive outside, and finally enter a new one. This additional <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> makes viral <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s about 4,500 subunits long.</p>
<p>&#160;To replicate successfully, the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> of large organisms must do even more, directing the construction of tens of thousands of different <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and the development of complex tissues and organs. This requires thousands of genes coded in millions to billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> subunits. Nevertheless, the essential process of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by variation and selection remains the same in the test tube, in viruses, and far beyond.</p><h1>Explaining <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a></h1><p>There are at least three ways to explain the structure of an evolved population of molecular replicators, whether test tube <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, viral genes, or <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genes. The first kind of explanation is a blow-by-blow account of their histories: how specific mutations occurred and how they spread. This is impossible without recording all the molecular events, and such a record would in any <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> be immensely tedious. &#160;</p>
<p>The second kind of explanation resorts to a somewhat misleading word: purpose. In detail, the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s simply change haphazardly and replicate selectively. Yet stepping back from the process, one <i>could</i> describe the outcome by imagining that the surviving <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s have changed to "achieve the goal" of replication. Why do <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that evolved under the threat of ribonuclease fold as they do? Because of a long and detailed <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, of course, but the idea that "they want to avoid attack and survive to replicate" would predict the same result. The <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of purpose makes useful shorthand (try discussing <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> without it!), but the appearance of purpose need not result from the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of a mind. The <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> example shows this quite neatly. &#160;</p>
<p>The third (and often best) kind of explanation - in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> - says that <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> emerges through the variation and selection of replicators. A <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> folds in a particular way because it resembles ancestors that multiplied more successfully (by avoiding attack, etc.), and left descendants including itself. As <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a> points out, the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of purpose (if used carefully) can be translated into the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. &#160;</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s patterns of success to the <i>elimination of unsuccessful changes</i>. It thus explains a positive as the result of a double negative - an explanation of a sort that seems slightly difficult to grasp. Worse, it explains something <i>visible</i> (successful, purposeful entities) in terms of something invisible (unsuccessful entities that have vanished). Because only successful beasts have littered the landscape with the bones of their descendants, the malformed failures of the past haven't even left many fossils.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind tends to focus on the visible, seeking positive causes for positive results, an ordering force behind orderly results. Yet through reflection we can see that this great principle has changed our past and will shape our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> <i>proceeds by the variation and selection of replicators</i>.</p><h1>Evolving Organisms</h1><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of an arms race based on molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. Today, as this race approaches a new and swifter phase, we need to be sure we understand just how deeply rooted <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is. In a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is often slighted in the schools and sometimes attacked, we should remember that the supporting evidence is as solid as rock and as common as cells. &#160;</p>
<p>In pages of stone, the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> itself has recorded the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. On lake bottoms and seabed, shells, bones, and silt have piled, layer on layer. Sometimes a shifting current or a geological upheaval has washed layers away; otherwise they have simply deepened. Early layers, buried deep, have been crushed, baked, soaked in mineral waters, and turned to stone. &#160;</p>
<p>For centuries, geologists have studied rocks to read <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s past. Long ago, they found seashells high in the crushed and crumpled rock of mountain ranges. By 1785 - seventy-four years before Darwin's detested book - James Hutton had concluded that seabed <a class="thought" href="entries/mud_entry.html">mud</a> had been pressed to stone and raised skyward by forces not yet understood. What else could geologists think, unless <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> itself had lied? &#160;</p>
<p>They saw that fossil bones and shells differed from layer to layer. They saw that shells in layers <i>here</i> matched shells in layers <i>there</i>, though the layers might lie deep beneath the land between. They named layers (A,B,<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>,D..., or Osagian, Meramecian, Lower Chesterian, Upper Chesterian, . .), and used characteristic fossils to trace rock layers. The churning of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s crust has nowhere left a complete sequence of layers exposed, yet geologists finding A,B,<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>,D,E in one place, <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>,D,E,F,G,H,I,J in another and J,K,L somewhere else could see that A preceded L. Petroleum geologists (even those who care nothing for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> or its implications) still use such fossils to date rock layers and to trace layers from one drill site to another.</p>
<p>&#160;Scientists came to the obvious conclusion. Just as sea <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> today live in broad areas, so did <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in years gone by. Just as layer piles on top of layer today, so did they then. Similar shells in similar layers mark sediments laid down in the same age. Shells change from layer to layer because <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> changed from age to age. This is what geologists found written in shells and bones on pages of stone.</p>
<p>&#160;The uppermost layers of rock contain bones of recent <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, deeper layers contain bones of <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s now extinct. Still earlier layers show no trace of any modern <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Below <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a> bones lie dinosaur bones; in older layers lie amphibian bones, then shells and fish bones, and then no bones or shells at all. The oldest fossil-bearing rocks bear the microscopic traces of single cells.</p>
<p>&#160;Radioactive dating shows these oldest traces to be several billion years old. Cells more complex than <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> date to little more than one billion years ago. The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of worms, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s spans hundreds of millions of years. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a>-like bones date back several million years. The remains of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s date back several thousand.</p>
<p>&#160;In three billion years, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> evolved from single cells able to soak up chemicals to collections of cells embodying minds able to soak up ideas. Within the last century, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has evolved from the steam locomotive and electric <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> to the spaceship and the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> - and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are already being taught to read and write. With mind and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has jumped a millionfold or more.</p><h1>Another Route Back</h1><p>The book of stone records the forms of long-dead organisms, yet living cells also carry records, genetic texts only now being read. As with the ideas of geology, the essential ideas of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> were known before Darwin had <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> pen to paper.</p>
<p>&#160;In lamp-lit temples and monasteries, generations of scribes copied and recopied manuscripts. Sometimes they miscopied words and sentences - whether by accident, by perversity, or by <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of the local ruler - and as the manuscripts replicated, aided by these <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, errors accumulated. The worst errors might be caught and removed, and famous passages might survive unchanged, but differences grew.</p>
<p>&#160;Ancient books seldom exist in their original versions. The oldest copies are often centuries younger than the lost originals. Nonetheless, from differing copies with differing errors, scholars can reconstruct versions closer to the original.</p>
<p>&#160;They compare texts. They can trace lines of descent from common ancestors because unique patterns of errors betray copying from a common source. (Schoolteachers know this: identical right answers aren't a tipoff - unless on an essay test - but woe to students sitting side by side who turn in tests with identical mistakes!) Where all surviving copies agree, scholars can assume that the original copy (or at least the last shared ancestor of the survivors) held the same words. Where survivors differ, scholars study copies that descended separately from a distant ancestor, because areas of agreement then indicate a common origin in the ancestral version.</p>
<p>&#160;Genes resemble manuscripts written in a four-letter alphabet. Much as a message can take many forms in ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> (restating an idea using entirely different words is no great strain), so different genetic wording can direct the construction of identical <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. Moreover, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s with different design details can serve identical functions. A collection of genes in a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> is like a whole book, and genes - like old manuscripts - have been copied and recopied by inaccurate scribes.</p>
<p>&#160;Like scholars studying ancient texts, biologists generally work with modern copies of their material (with, alas, no <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> Dead Sea Scrolls from the early days of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>). They compare organisms with similar appearances (lions and tigers, horses and zebras, rats and mice) and find that they give similar answers to the essay questions in their genes and <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. The more two organisms differ (lions and lizards, humans and sunflowers), the more these answers differ, even among molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s serving identical functions. More telling still, similar <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s make the same mistakes - all primates, for example, lack enzymes for making vitamin <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, an omission shared by only two other known <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s, the guinea pig and the fruit bat. This suggests that we primates have copied our genetic answers from a shared source, long ago.</p>
<p>&#160;The same principle that shows the lines of descent of ancient texts (and that helps correct their copying errors) thus also reveals the lines of descent of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Indeed, it indicates that all known <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> shares a common ancestor.</p><h1>The Rise of the Replicators</h1><p>The first replicators on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> evolved abilities beyond those possible to <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s replicating in test tubes. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> they reached the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l stage, they had developed the "modern" <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of using <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, and ribosomes to construct <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. Mutations then changed not only the replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> itself, but <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and the living structures they build and shape.</p>
<p>&#160;Teams of genes shaped ever more elaborate cells, then guided the cellular cooperation that formed complex organisms. Variation and selection favored teams of genes that shaped beasts with protective skins and hungry mouths, animated by <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> and muscle, guided by eye and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. As <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a> puts it, genes built ever more elaborate survival <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to aid their own replication.</p>
<p>&#160;When dog genes replicate, they often shuffle with those of other dogs that have been selected by people, who then select which puppies to keep and breed. Over the millennia, people have molded wolf-like beasts into greyhounds, toy poodles, dachshunds, and Saint Bernards. By selecting which genes survive, people have reshaped dogs in both body and temperament. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> desires have defined success for dog genes; other pressures have defined success for wolf genes.</p>
<p>&#160;Mutation and selection of genes has, through long ages, filled the world with grass and trees, with <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, fish, and people. More recently, other things have appeared and multiplied - tools, houses, aircraft, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. And like the lifeless <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, this <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> has <i>evolved</i>.</p><h1>Evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a></h1><p>As the stone of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> records the emergence of ever more complex and capable forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, so the relics and writings of humanity record the emergence of ever more complex and capable forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. Our oldest surviving <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> is itself stone, buried with the fossils of our ancestors; our newest <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> orbits overhead.</p>
<p>&#160;Consider for a moment the hybrid ancestry of the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttle. On its aircraft side, it descends from the aluminum jets of the sixties, which themselves sprang from a line stretching back through the aluminum prop planes of World War II, to the wood-and-cloth biplanes of World War I, to the motorized gliders of the Wright brothers, to toy gliders and kites. On its rocket side, the shuttle traces back to Moon rockets, to <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> missiles, to last century's artillery rockets ("and the rocket's red glare..."), and finally to fireworks and toys. This aircraft/rocket hybrid flies, and by varying <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s and designs, aerospace <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will evolve still better ones.</p>
<p>&#160;Engineers speak of "generations" of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; Japan's "fifth generation" <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> project shows how swiftly some technologies grow and spawn. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers speak of "hybrids," of "competing technologies," and of their "proliferation." <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> Director of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Ralph E. Gomory emphasizes the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, writing that "<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> development is much more <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary and much less revolutionary or breakthrough-oriented than most people imagine." (Indeed, even breakthroughs as important as molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will develop through many small steps.) In the quote that heads this chapter, Professor Herbert A. Simon of Carnegie-Mellon University urges us to "think of the design process as involving first the generation of alternatives and then the testing of these alternatives against a whole array of requirements and constraints." Generation and testing of alternatives is synonymous with variation and selection.</p>
<p>&#160;Sometimes various alternatives already exist. In "One Highly Evolved Toolbox," in <i>The Next Whole </i><a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a><i> Catalog</i>, J. Baldwin writes: "Our portable shop has been evolving for about twenty years now. There's nothing really very special about it except that a continuing process of removing obsolete or inadequate tools and replacing them with more suitable ones has resulted in a collection that has become a thing-making <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> rather than a pile of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>."</p>
<p>&#160;Baldwin uses the term "evolving" accurately. <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">Invention</a> and manufacture have for millennia generated variations in tool designs, and Baldwin has winnowed the current crop by competitive selection, keeping those that work best with his other tools to serve his needs. Through years of variation and selection, his <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> evolved - a process he highly recommends. Indeed, he urges that one never try to plan out the purchase of a complete <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of tools. Instead, he urges buying the tools one often borrows, tools selected not by theory but by experience.</p>
<p>&#160;Technological variations are often deliberate, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers are paid to invent and test. Still, some novelties are sheer accident, like the discovery of a crude form of Teflon in a cylinder supposedly full of tetrafluoroethylene gas: with its valve open, it remained heavy; when it was sawed open, it revealed a strange, waxy solid. Other novelties have come from <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic blundering. Edison tried <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>izing everything from paper to bamboo to spider webs when he was seeking a good <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-bulb filament. Charles Goodyear messed around in a kitchen for years, trying to convert gummy natural rubber into a durable substance, until at last he chanced to drop sulfurized rubber on a hot stove, performing the first crude vulcanization. &#160;</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, enlightened trial and error, not the planning of flawless intellects, has brought most advances; this is why <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers build prototypes. Peters and Waterman in their book <i>In</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a> <i>of Excellence</i> show that the same holds true of advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> products and policies. This is why excellent companies create "an environment and a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of attitudes that encourage experimentation," and why they evolve "in a very Darwinian way."</p>
<p>&#160;Factories bring <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> through variation and selection. Crude quality-control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s test and discard faulty parts before assembling products, and sophisticated quality-control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s use statistical methods to track defects to their sources, helping <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers change the manufacturing process to minimize defects. Japanese <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, building on W. Edwards Deming's work in statistical quality control, have made such variation and selection of industrial processes a pillar of their country's economic success. <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will likewise need to measure results to eliminate flaws.</p>
<p>&#160;Quality control is a sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, aiming not at change but at eliminating harmful variations. But just as Darwinian <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> can preserve and spread favorable mutations, so good quality control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can help managers and workers to preserve and spread more effective processes, whether they appear by accident or by design.</p>
<p>&#160;All this tinkering by <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and manufacturers prepares products for their ultimate test. Out in the market, endless varieties of wrench, car, sock, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> compete for the favor of buyers. When informed buyers are free to choose, products that do too little or cost too much eventually fail to be re-produced. As in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, competitive testing makes yesterday's best competitor into tomorrow's fossil. "<a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">Ecology</a>" and "economy" share more than linguistic roots.</p>
<p>&#160;Both in the marketplace and on real and imaginary battlefields, global competition drives organizations to invent, buy, beg, and steal ever more capable technologies. Some organizations compete chiefly to serve people with superior goods, others compete chiefly to intimidate them with superior weapons. The pressures of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> drive both.</p>
<p>&#160;The global <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race has been accelerating for billions of years. The earthworm's blindness could not block the development of sharp-eyed birds. The bird's small <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and clumsy wings could not block the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> hands, minds, and shotguns. Likewise, local prohibitions cannot block advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> and commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. It seems that we must guide the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race or die, yet the force of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> makes a mockery of anti-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> movements: democratic movements for local restraint can only restrain the world's democracies, not the world as a whole. The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and the potential of new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> suggest some solutions, but this is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> for Part Three.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> of Design</h1><p>It might seem that design offers an alternative to <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but design involves <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in two distinct ways. First, design practice itself evolves. Not only do <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers accumulate designs that work, they accumulate design methods that work. These range from handbook standards for choosing pipes to management <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s for organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development. And as Alfred North Whitehead stated, "The greatest <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the nineteenth century was the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the method of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>."</p>
<p>&#160;Second, design itself proceeds by variation and selection, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers often use mathematical laws evolved to describe (for example) heat flow and elasticity to test <i>simulated</i> designs before building them. They thus evolve plans through a cycle of design, calculation, criticism, and redesign, avoiding the expense of cutting metal. The creation of designs thus proceeds through a nonmaterial form of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Hooke's law, for example, describes how metal bends and stretches: deformation is proportional to the applied stress; twice the pull, twice the stretch. Though only roughly correct, it remains fairly accurate until the metal's springiness finally yields to stress. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers can use a form of Hooke's law to design a bar of metal that can support a load without bending too far - and then make it just a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> thicker to allow for inaccuracies in the law and in their design calculations. They can also use a form of Hooke's law to describe the bending and twisting of aircraft wings, tennis rackets, and automobile frames. But simple mathematical equations don't wrap smoothly around such convoluted structures. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers have to fit the equations to simpler shapes (to pieces of the design), and then assemble these partial solutions to describe the flexing of the whole. It is a method (called "finite <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> analysis") that typically requires immense calculations, and without <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s it would be impractical. With them, it has grown common.</p>
<p>&#160;Such simulations extend an ancient trend. We have always imagined consequences, in hope and fear, when we have needed to select a course of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. Simpler mental models (whether inborn or learned) undoubtedly guide <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s as well. When based on accurate mental models, <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> experiments can replace more costly (or even deadly) physical experiments - a development <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has favored. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering simulations simply extend this ability to imagine consequences, to make our mistakes in <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> rather than deed.</p>
<p>&#160;In "One Highly Evolved Toolbox," J. Baldwin discusses how tools and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> mesh in job-shop work: "You begin to build your tool capability into the way you think about making things. As anyone who makes a lot of stuff will tell you, the tools soon become sort of an automatic part of the design process . . . But tools can't become part of your design process if you don't know what is available and what the various tools do."</p>
<p>&#160;Having a feel for tool capabilities is essential when planning a jobshop project for delivery next Wednesday; it is equally essential when shaping a strategy for handling the breakthroughs of the coming decades. The better our feel for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>'s tools, the sounder will be our plans for surviving and prospering.</p>
<p>&#160;A craftsman in a job shop can keep tools in plain sight; working with them every day makes them familiar to his eyes, hands, and mind. He gets to know their abilities naturally, and can put this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to immediate creative use. But people - like us - who have to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> face a greater challenge, because the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>'s tools exist now only as ideas and as possibilities implicit in natural law. These tools neither hang on the wall nor impress themselves on the mind through sight and sound and touch - nor will they, until they exist as <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. In the coming years of preparation only study, imagination, and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> can make their abilities real to the mind.</p><h1>What Are the New Replicators?</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> shows us that <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> evolves. Test tube <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, viruses, and dogs all show how <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> proceeds by the modification and testing of replicators. But <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> (today) cannot reproduce itself - so where are the replicators behind the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>? What are the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> genes?</p>
<p>&#160;Of course, we need not actually identify replicators in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Darwin described <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> before Mendel discovered genes, and geneticists learned much about heredity before Watson and Crick discovered the structure of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. Darwin needed no <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> to see that organisms varied and that some left more descendants.</p>
<p>&#160;A replicator is a pattern that can get copies of itself made. It may need help; without <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to copy it, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> could not replicate. But by this standard, some <i><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s</i> are replicators! Companies often make <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that fall into the hands of a competitor; the competitor then learns their secrets and builds copies. Just as genes "use" <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to replicate, so such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s "use" <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds and hands to replicate. With nanocomputers directing <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and disassemblers, the replication of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> could even be automated.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind, though, is a far subtler <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> of imitation than any mere <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>. Voice, writing, and drawing can transmit designs from mind to mind before they take form as <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. The ideas behind methods of design are subtler yet: more abstract than <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, they replicate and function exclusively in the world of minds and symbol <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Where genes have evolved over generations and eons, mental replicators now evolve over days and decades. Like genes, ideas split, combine, and take multiple forms (genes can be transcribed from <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> and back again; ideas can be translated from <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>). <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> cannot yet describe the neural patterns that embody ideas in brains, but anyone can see that ideas mutate, replicate, and compete. Ideas evolve.</p>
<p>&#160;Richard Dawkins calls bits of replicating mental patterns "memes" (<i><a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a></i> rhymes with <i>cream</i>). He says "examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body [generation to generation] via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> pool by leaping from <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> via a process which, in the broad <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, can be called imitation."</p><h1>The Creatures of the Mind</h1><p>Memes replicate because people both learn and teach. They vary because people create the new and misunderstand the old. They are selected (in part) because people don't believe or repeat everything they hear. As test tube <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s compete for scarce copying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and subunits, so memes must compete for a scarce resource - <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> attention and effort. Since memes shape behavior, their success or failure is a deadly serious <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Since ancient times, mental models and patterns of behavior have passed from parent to child. <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">Meme</a> patterns that aid survival and reproduction have tended to spread. (Eat this <a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a> only after cooking; don't eat those berries, their evil <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>s will twist your guts.) Year by year, people varied their <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s with varying results. Year by year, some died while others found new tricks of survival and passed them on. Genes built brains skilled at imitation because the patterns imitated were, on the whole, of value - their bearers, after all, had survived to spread them.</p>
<p>&#160;Memes themselves, though, face their own <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s of "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>": as replicators, they evolve solely to survive and spread. Like viruses, they can replicate without aiding their host's survival or well-being. Indeed, the <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> for martyrdom-in-a-cause can spread itself through the very act of killing its host.</p>
<p>&#160;Genes, like memes, survive by many strategies. Some duck genes have spread themselves by encouraging ducks to pair off to care for their gene-bearing eggs and young. Some duck genes have spread themselves (when in <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> ducks) by encouraging rape, and some (when in <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> ducks) by encouraging the planting of eggs in other ducks' nests. Still other genes found in ducks are <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> genes, able to spread without making more ducks. Protecting eggs helps the duck <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> (and the individual duck genes) survive; rape helps one <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of duck genes at the expense of others; infection helps viral genes at the expense of duck genes in general. As <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a> points out, genes "care" only about their own replication: they appear selfish. &#160;</p>
<p>But selfish motives can encourage cooperation. People seeking money and recognition for themselves cooperate to build corporations that serve other people's wants. Selfish genes cooperate to build organisms that themselves often cooperate. Even so, to imagine that genes <i>automatically</i> serve some greater good (- of their <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>? - their cell? - their body? - their <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>?) is to mistake a common effect for an underlying cause. To ignore the selfishness of replicators is to be lulled by a dangerous illusion.</p>
<p>&#160;Some genes in cells are out-and-out parasites. Like herpes genes inserted in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s, they exploit cells and harm their hosts. Yet if genes can be parasites, why not memes as well?</p>
<p>&#160;In <i>The Extended Phenotype</i>, <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a> describes a worm that parasitizes bees and completes its <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle in water. It gets from bee to water by making the host bee dive to its <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. Similarly, ant brainworms must enter a sheep to complete their <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle. To accomplish this, they burrow into the host ant's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, somehow causing changes that make the ant "want" to climb to the top of a grass stem and wait, eventually to be eaten by a sheep.</p>
<p>&#160;As worms enter other organisms and use them to survive and replicate, so do memes. Indeed, the <i>absence</i> of memes exploiting people for their own selfish ends would be amazing, a sign of some powerful - indeed, nearly perfect - mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>. But parasitic memes clearly do exist. Just as viruses evolve to stimulate cells to make viruses, so rumors evolve to sound plausible and juicy, stimulating repetition. Ask not whether a rumor is true, ask instead how it spreads. Experience shows that ideas evolved to be successful replicators need have little to do with the truth.</p>
<p>&#160;At best, chain letters, spurious rumors, fashionable lunacies, and other mental parasites harm people by wasting their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. At worst, they implant deadly misconceptions. These <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s exploit <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ignorance and vulnerability. Spreading them is like having a cold and sneezing on a friend. Though some memes act much like viruses, infectiousness isn't necessarily bad (think of an infectious grin, or infectious good <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>). If a package of ideas has merit, then its infectiousness simply increases its merit - and indeed, the best ethical teachings also teach us to teach <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a>. Good publications may entertain, enrich understanding, aid judgment - and advertise gift subscriptions. Spreading useful <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is like offering useful seeds to a friend with a garden.</p><h1>Selecting Ideas</h1><p>Parasites have forced organisms to evolve <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>s, such as the enzymes that <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> use to cut up invading viruses, or the roving white blood cells our bodies use to destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. Parasitic memes have forced minds down a similar path, evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that serve as mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;The oldest and simplest mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> simply commands "believe the old, reject the new." Something like this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> generally kept tribes from abandoning old, tested ways in favor of wild new notions - such as the notion that obeying alleged ghostly orders to destroy all the tribe's cattle and grain would somehow bring forth a miraculous abundance of food and armies of ancestors to drive out foreigners. (This <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> package infected the Xhosa people of southern Africa in 1856; by the next year 68,000 had died, chiefly of starvation.)</p>
<p>&#160;Your body's <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> follows a similar rule: it generally accepts all the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> types present in early <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and reject such as potential <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells and invading <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, as foreign and dangerous. This simple reject-the-new <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> once worked well, yet in this era of organ transplantation it can kill. Similarly, in an era when <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> regularly present facts that are both new and trustworthy, a rigid mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> becomes a dangerous handicap.</p>
<p>&#160;For all its shortcomings, though, the reject-the-new principle is simple and offers real advantages. Tradition holds much that is tried and true (or if not true, then at least workable). Change is risky: just as most mutations are bad, so most new ideas are wrong. Even <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> can be dangerous: if a tradition links sound practices to a fear of ghosts, then overconfident rational <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> may throw out the good with the bogus. Unfortunately, traditions evolved to <i>be</i> good may have less appeal than ideas evolved to <i>sound</i> good - when first questioned, the soundest tradition may be displaced by worse ideas that better appeal to the rational mind.</p>
<p>&#160;Yet memes that seal the mind against new ideas protect themselves in a suspiciously self-serving way. While protecting valuable traditions from clumsy editing, they may also shield parasitic claptrap from the test of truth. In times of swift change they can make minds dangerously rigid.</p>
<p>&#160;Much of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> may be seen as a <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for better mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>s, for better ways to reject the false, the worthless, and the damaging. The best <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s respect tradition, yet encourage experiment. They suggest standards for judging memes, helping the mind distinguish between parasites and tools.</p>
<p>&#160;The principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> provide a way to view change, whether in <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, organisms, technologies, minds, or cultures. The same <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> questions keep arising: What are the replicators? How do they vary? What determines their success? How do they defend against invaders? These questions will arise again when we consider the consequences of the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> revolution, and yet again when we consider how society might deal with those consequences.</p>
<p>&#160;The deep-rooted principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary change will shape the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, even as the distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> begins to blur. These principles show much about what we can and cannot hope to achieve, and they can help us focus our efforts to shape the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. They also tell us much about what we can and cannot foresee, because they guide the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> not only of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, but of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> itself.</p>
