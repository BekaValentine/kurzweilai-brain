<div class="TeaserText">Physicists are converging on a "theory of everything," probing the 11th dimension, developing computers for the next generation of robots, and speculating about civilizations millions of years ahead of ours, says Dr. Michio Kaku, author of the best-sellers Hyperspace and Visions and co-founder of String Field Theory, in this interview by KurzweilAI.net Editor Amara D. Angelica.</div>
<br>
<br> <p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net June 26, 2003.</i> </p>
<p><i><b>What are the burning issues for you currently?</b></i> </p>
<p>Well, several things. Professionally, I work on something called 
              Superstring theory, or now called M-theory, and the goal is to find 
              an equation, perhaps no more than one inch long, which will allow 
              us to "read the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>," as Einstein used to say. 
            </p>
<p>In other words, we want a single theory that gives us an elegant, 
              beautiful representation of the forces that govern the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. 
              Now, after two thousand years of investigation into the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, we physicists believe that there are four fundamental forces 
              that govern the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>.</p>
<p>Some physicists have speculated about the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of a fifth 
              force, which may be some kind of paranormal or psychic force, but 
              so far we find no reproducible evidence of a fifth force. </p>
<p>Now, each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a force has been mastered, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> has undergone 
              a significant change. In the 1600s, when <a class="thought" href="entries/newton_entry.html">Isaac Newton</a> first unraveled 
              the secret of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, he also created a mechanics. And from Newton's 
              Laws and his mechanics, the foundation was laid for the steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>, 
              and eventually the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>So, in other words, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, a byproduct of the mastery of 
              the first force, <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, helped to spur the creation of the Industrial 
              Revolution, which in turn is perhaps one of the greatest revolutions 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. </p>
<p>The second great force is the <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> force; that is, the 
              force of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, electricity, magnetism, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, lasers, microwaves, x-rays, etc. </p>
<p>And then in the 1860s, it was James Clerk Maxwell, the Scottish 
              physicist at Cambridge University, who finally wrote down Maxwell's 
              equations, which allow us to summarize the <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. </p>
<p>That helped to unleash the Electric Age, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Age, 
              which have changed all of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. Now it's hard to believe, 
              but Newton's equations and Einstein's equations are no more than 
              about half an inch long. </p>
<p>Maxwell's equations are also about half an inch long. For example, 
              Maxwell's equations say that the "four-dimensional divergence of 
              an antisymmetric, second-rank tensor equals zero." That's Maxwell's 
              equations, the equations for <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. And in fact, at Berkeley, you 
              can buy a T-shirt which says, "In the beginning, <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> said the 
              four-dimensional divergence of an antisymmetric, second rank tensor 
              equals zero, and there was <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a>, and it was good."</p>
<p>So, the mastery of the first two forces helped to unleash, respectively, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Revolution. </p>
<p>The last two forces are the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear 
              force, and they in turn have helped us to unlock the secret of the 
              stars, via Einstein's equations E=mc<sup>2</sup>, and many people 
              think that far in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race may ultimately derive 
              its <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> not only from solar power, which is the power of fusion, 
              but also fusion power on the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, in terms of fusion reactors, 
              which operate on seawater, and create no copious quantities of radioactive 
              waste.</p>
<p>So, in summary, the mastery of each force helped to unleash a new 
              revolution in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we physicists are embarking upon the greatest quest of all, 
              which is to unify all four of these forces into a single comprehensive 
              theory. The first force, <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, is now represented by Einstein's 
              General Theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">Relativity</a>, which gives us the Big Bang, black 
              holes, and expanding <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.&#160; It's a theory of the very large; 
              it's a theory of smooth, <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> manifolds like bedsheets and 
              trampoline nets.</p>
<p>The second theory, the quantum theory, is the exact opposite. The 
              quantum theory allows us to unify the <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a>, weak and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_force_entry.html">strong force</a>. However, it is based on discrete, tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> called quanta, rather than smooth bedsheets, and it is based 
              on probabilities, rather than the certainty of Einstein's equations. 
              So these two theories summarize the sum total of all physical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              of the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. </p>
<p>Any equation describing the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> ultimately is derived 
              from one of these two theories. The problem is these two theories 
              are diametrically opposed. They are based on different assumptions, 
              different principles, and different <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. Our job as physicists 
              is to unify the two into a single, comprehensive theory. Now, over 
              the last decades, the giants of the twentieth century have tried 
              to do this and have failed.&#160; </p>
<p>For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/bohr_entry.html">Niels Bohr</a>, the founder of atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and the 
              quantum theory, was very skeptical about many attempts over the 
              decades to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/unified_field_theory_entry.html">Unified Field Theory</a>.&#160; One day, Wolfgang Pauli, 
              Nobel laureate, was giving a talk about his version of the Unified 
              Field Theory, and in a very famous story,&#160; Bohr stood up in the 
              back of the room and said, "Mr. Pauli, we in the back are convinced 
              that your theory is crazy. What divides us is whether your theory 
              is crazy enough."</p>
<p>So today, we realize that a true <a class="thought" href="entries/unified_field_theory_entry.html">Unified Field Theory</a> must be bizarre, 
              must be fantastic, incredible, <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>-boggling, crazy, because all 
              the sane alternatives have been studied and discarded. </p>
<p>Today we have <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a>, which is based on the idea that the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s we see in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> are nothing but notes we see 
              on a tiny, vibrating string. If you kick the string, then an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> 
              will turn into a <a class="thought" href="entries/neutrino_entry.html">neutrino</a>. If you kick it again, the vibrating string 
              will turn from a <a class="thought" href="entries/neutrino_entry.html">neutrino</a> into a <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a> or a graviton. And if you 
              kick it enough times, the vibrating string will then mutate into 
              all the <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s. </p>
<p>Therefore we no longer in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> have to deal with thousands 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s coming from our <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> smashers, we just have 
              to realize that what makes them, what drives them, is a vibrating 
              string. Now when these strings collide, they form atoms and nuclei, 
              and so in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, the melodies that you can write on the string 
              correspond to the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> is then reduced to 
              the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/harmony_entry.html">harmony</a> that we can write on a string. The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> 
              is a symphony of strings. And what is the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> that Einstein 
              used to write about? According to this picture, the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> resonating through ten- or eleven-dimensional hyperspace, 
              which of course begs the question, "If the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is a symphony, 
              then is there a composer to the symphony?"&#160; But that's another 
              question.</p>
<h2><b>Parallel worlds</b></h2>
<p><i><b>What do you think of Sir Martin Rees' concerns about the 
              risk of creating <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> in his book, </b></i><b>Our 
              Final Hour<i>?</i></b></p>
<p>I haven't read his book, but perhaps Sir <a name="OLE_LINK2"><font color="#000000">Martin 
              Rees</font></a> is referring to many press reports that claim that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> may be swallowed up by a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> created by our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              This started with a letter to the editor in <i>Scientific American</i> 
              asking whether the RHIC accelerator in Brookhaven, Long Island, 
              will create a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> which will swallow up the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. This was 
              then picked up by the Sunday <i>London Times</i> who then splashed 
              it on the international wire services, and all of a sudden, we physicists 
              were deluged with hundreds of emails and telegrams asking whether 
              or not we are going to destroy the world when we create a black 
              hole in Long Island. </p>
<p>However, you can calculate that in outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, cosmic rays have 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> than the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s produced in our most powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> 
              smashers, and <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s do not form in outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Not to mention 
              the fact that to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>, you would have to have the 
              mass of a giant <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>. In fact, an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> ten to fifty times the 
              mass of our <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> may in fact form a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>. So the probability 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> forming in Long Island is zero. </p>
<p>However, Sir Martin Rees also has written a book, talking about 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a>. And that is also the subject of my next book, coming 
              out late next year, called <i>Parallel Worlds</i>. We physicists 
              no longer believe in a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. We physicists believe in a <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> 
              that resembles the boiling of water. Water boils when tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, 
              or bubbles, form, which then begin to rapidly expand. If our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> 
              is a bubble in boiling water, then perhaps Big Bangs happen all 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>Now, the <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> idea is consistent with Superstring theory, 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that Superstring theory has millions of solutions, 
              each of which seems to correspond to a self-consistent <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. 
              So in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, Superstring theory is drowning in its own riches. 
              Instead of predicting a unique <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, it seems to allow the possibility 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s.&#160; </p>
<p>This may also help to answer the question raised by the Anthropic 
              Principle. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> seems to have known that we were coming. 
              The conditions for <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> are extremely stringent. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              can only exist in a very narrow band of physical <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s. For 
              example, if the <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a> is not stable, then the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> will collapse 
              into a useless heap of <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neutrino_entry.html">neutrino</a>s. If the <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a> were 
              a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> different in mass, it would decay, and all our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s would decay along with it.</p>
<p>In fact, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of coincidences, 
              happy coincidences, that make <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> possible. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, and especially 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, is quite fragile. It depends on stable <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, like 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>s, that exists for billions of years in a stable environment, 
              sufficient to create autocatalytic <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that can reproduce 
              themselves, and thereby create <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. In <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, it is extremely 
              hard to create this kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. You have to play with the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s, you have to juggle the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s, cook the books, in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> which is consistent with <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>.</p>
<p>However, the <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> idea explains this problem, because it 
              simply means we coexist with dead <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s. In other <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a> is not stable. In other <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s, the Big Bang took 
              place, and then it collapsed rapidly into a <a class="thought" href="entries/big_crunch_entry.html">Big Crunch</a>, or these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s had a Big Bang, and immediately went into a Big Freeze, 
              where temperatures were so low, that <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> could never get started.</p>
<p>So, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s, many of these <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s are 
              in fact dead, and our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> in this <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> is special, in that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is possible in this <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. Now, in <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, we have the 
              Judeo-Christian idea of an instant of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, a genesis, when <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> 
              said, "Let there be <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>." But in Buddhism, we have a 
              contradictory <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, which says that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> is timeless. 
              It had no beginning, and it had no end, it just is. It's eternal, 
              and it has no beginning or end.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> idea allows us to combine these two pictures into 
              a coherent, pleasing picture. It says that in the beginning, there 
              was nothing, nothing but hyperspace, perhaps ten- or eleven-dimensional 
              hyperspace. But hyperspace was unstable, because of the quantum 
              principle. And because of the quantum principle, there were fluctuations, 
              fluctuations in nothing. This means that bubbles began to form in 
              nothing, and these bubbles began to expand rapidly, giving us the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. So, in other words, the Judeo-Christian genesis takes 
              place within the Buddhist nirvana, all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and our <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">Multiverse</a> 
              percolates <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s.</p>
<p>Now this also raises the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s that look just 
              like ours, except there's one quantum difference.&#160; Let's say for 
              example, that a cosmic ray went through Churchill's mother, and 
              Churchill was never born, as a consequence. In that <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, which 
              is only one quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> away from our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, England never 
              had a dynamic leader to lead its forces against Hitler, and Hitler 
              was able to overcome England, and in fact conquer the world. </p>
<p>So, we are one quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> away from <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>s that look quite 
              different from ours, and it's still not clear how we physicists 
              resolve this question. This <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> revolves around the Schr&#246;dinger's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">Cat</a> problem, which is still largely unsolved. In any quantum theory, 
              we have the possibility that atoms can exist in two places at the 
              same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, in two states at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; And then Erwin Schr&#246;dinger, 
              the founder of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, asked the question: let's say 
              we put a <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> in a box, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is connected to a jar of poison 
              gas, which is connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger 
              counter, which is connected to uranium.&#160; Everyone believes that 
              uranium has to be described by the quantum theory. That's why we 
              have atomic bombs, in fact. No one disputes this. </p>
<p>But if the uranium decays, triggering the Geiger counter, setting 
              off the hammer, destroying the jar of poison gas, then I might kill 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>. And so, is the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> dead or alive? Believe it or not, we 
              physicists have to superimpose, or add together, the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function 
              of a dead <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function of a live <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>. So the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is 
              neither dead nor alive. </p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the deepest questions in all the quantum 
              theory, with Nobel laureates arguing with other Nobel laureates 
              about the meaning of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> itself. </p>
<p>Now, in <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, solipsists like Bishop Berkeley used to believe 
              that if a tree fell in the forest and there was no one there to 
              listen to the tree fall, then perhaps the tree did not fall at all. 
              However, Newtonians believe that if a tree falls in the forest, 
              that you don't have to have a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> there to witness the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. 
            </p>
<p>The quantum theory puts a whole new spin on this. The quantum theory 
              says that before you look at the tree, the tree could be in any 
              possible state. It could be burnt, a sapling, it could be firewood, 
              it could be burnt to the ground. It could be in any of an infinite 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible states. Now, when you look at it, it suddenly 
              springs into <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> and becomes a tree. </p>
<p>Einstein never liked this. When people used to come to his house, 
              he used to ask them, "Look at the moon. Does the moon exist 
              because a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> looks at the moon?" Well, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, yes. 
              According to the Copenhagen school of Neils Bohr, observation determines 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. </p>
<p>Now, there are at least two ways to resolve this. The first is 
              the Wigner school. Eugene Wigner was one of the creators of the 
              atomic bomb and a Nobel laureate. And he believed that observation 
              creates the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. An infinite sequence of observations is necessary 
              to create the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, and in fact, maybe there's a cosmic observer, 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> of some sort, that makes the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> spring into <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>.</p>
<p>There's another theory, however, called decoherence, or many worlds, 
              which believes that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> simply splits each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, so that 
              we live in a world where the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is alive, but there's an equal 
              world where the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is dead. In that world, they have people, they 
              react normally, they think that their world is the only world, but 
              in that world, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is dead. And, in fact, we exist simultaneously 
              with that world.</p>
<p>This means that there's probably a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> where you were never 
              born, but everything else is the same. Or perhaps your mother had 
              extra brothers and sisters for you, in which case your family is 
              much larger. Now, this can be compared to sitting in a room, listening 
              to radio. When you listen to radio, you hear many frequencies. They 
              exist simultaneously all around you in the room. However, your radio 
              is only tuned to one frequency. In the same way, in your living 
              room, there is the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function of dinosaurs. There is the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> 
              function of aliens from outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. There is the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function 
              of the Roman Empire, because it never fell, 1500 years ago. </p>
<p>All of this coexists inside your living room. However, just like 
              you can only tune into one radio channel, you can only tune into 
              one <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> channel, and that is the channel that you exist in. 
              So, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> it is true that we coexist with all possible <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s. 
              The catch is, we cannot communicate with them, we cannot enter these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s.</p>
<p>However, I personally believe that at some point in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, 
              that may be our only salvation. The latest cosmological <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> indicates 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> is accelerating, not slowing down, which means 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> will eventually hit a Big Freeze, trillions of years 
              from now, when temperatures are so low that it will be impossible 
              to have any intelligent being survive. </p>
<p>When the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> dies, there's one and only one way to survive 
              in a freezing <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>, and that is to leave the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. In <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
              there is a law of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> that says if the environment becomes hostile, 
              either you adapt, you leave, or you die. </p>
<p>When the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> freezes and temperatures reach near absolute 
              zero, you cannot adapt. The <a class="thought" href="entries/laws_of_thermodynamics_entry.html">laws of thermodynamics</a> are quite rigid 
              on this question. Either you will die, or you will leave. This means, 
              of course, that we have to create <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that will allow us to 
              enter eleven-dimensional hyperspace. This is still quite speculative, 
              but <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">String theory</a>, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, may be our only salvation. For 
              advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s in outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, either we leave or we die.</p>
<p><i><b>That brings up a question. <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> Reloaded seems to be based 
              on parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s. What do you think of the film in terms of 
              its metaphors?</b></i></p>
<p>Well, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> found in the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> would correspond to that 
              of an advanced Type I or Type II <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. We physicists, when 
              we scan outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, do not look for little green men in flying 
              saucers. We look for the total <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> outputs of a <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> 
              in outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, with a characteristic frequency. Even if intelligent 
              beings tried to hide their <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>, by the second law of thermodynamics, 
              they create <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, which should be visible with our detectors.</p>
<p>So we classify <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s on the basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> outputs. A 
              Type I <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary. They control all <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary forms 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. They would control, for example, the weather, volcanoes, 
              earthquakes; they would mine the oceans, any <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary form of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              they would control. Type II would be stellar. They play with solar 
              flares. They can move stars, ignite stars, play with white dwarfs. 
              Type III is galactic, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that they have now conquered 
              whole <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and are able to use <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> clusters 
              for their <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> supplies. </p>
<p>Each <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is separated by the previous <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> by 
              a factor of ten billion. Therefore, you can calculate numerically 
              at what point <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s may begin to harness certain kinds of 
              technologies. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> wormholes and parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s, 
              you have to be probably a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>, because by definition, 
              a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> has enough <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to play with the Planck 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. </p>
<p>The Planck <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, or 10<sup>19</sup> billion <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> volts, is the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              at which <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> becomes unstable. If you were to heat up, in 
              your microwave oven, a piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a> to that <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, then 
              bubbles would form inside your microwave oven, and each bubble in 
              turn would correspond to a baby <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. </p>
<p>Now, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, several metaphors are raised. One metaphor 
              is whether computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can create artificial realities. That 
              would require a <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> centuries or millennia ahead of ours, 
              which would place it squarely as a Type I or Type II <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. 
            </p>
<p>However, we also have to ask a practical question: is it possible 
              to create implants that could <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> banks to create 
              this artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, and are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s dangerous? My answer is 
              the following. First of all, <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s: the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              does not exist, and probably won't exist for at least a century, 
              for us to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_nervous_system_entry.html">central nervous system</a>. At present, we can 
              only do primitive <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s on the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>For example, at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, it's possible 
              to put a glass implant into the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of a stroke victim, and the 
              paralyzed stroke victim is able to, by looking at the cursor of 
              a laptop, eventually control the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the cursor. It's very 
              slow and tedious; it's like <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to ride a bicycle for the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> grows into the glass bead, which is placed into 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The glass bead is connected to a laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and 
              over many hours, the person is able to, by pure <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, manipulate 
              the cursor on the screen.</p>
<p>So, the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_nervous_system_entry.html">central nervous system</a> is basically a black box. Except 
              for some primitive hookups to the visual <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, we 
              scientists have not been able to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> most bodily functions, because 
              we simply don't know the <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> for the spinal cord and for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              So, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, I believe is one hundred, maybe centuries 
              away from ours. </p>
<h2><b>Will robots take over?</b></h2>
<p>On the other hand, we have to ask yet another metaphor raised by 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, and that is, are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s dangerous? And the answer 
              is, potentially, yes. However, at present, our robots have the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              of a cockroach, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> and common 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> are the two most difficult, unsolved problems in artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> theory. <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">Pattern recognition</a> means the ability to see, 
              hear, and to understand what you are seeing and understand what 
              you are hearing. <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common sense</a> means your ability to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> out 
              of the world, which even children can perform. </p>
<p>Those two problems are at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> largely unsolved. Now, 
              I think, however, that within a few decades, we should be able to 
              create robots as smart as mice, maybe dogs and cats. However, when 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s start to become as dangerous as monkeys, I think we should 
              put a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> in their <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, to shut them off when they start to have 
              murderous <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s. </p>
<p>By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you have monkey <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, you begin to have self-awareness, 
              and with self-awareness, you begin to have an agenda created by 
              a monkey for its own purposes. And at that point, a mechanical monkey 
              may decide that its agenda is different from our agenda, and at 
              that point they may become dangerous to humans. I think we have 
              several decades before that happens, and <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> will probably 
              collapse in 20 years anyway, so I think there's plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> before 
              we come to the point where we have to deal with murderous robots, 
              like in the movie <i>2001</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>So you differ with <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s 
              to reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er and upload the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, possibly within the coming 
              decades?</b></i></p>
<p>Not necessarily. I'm just laying out a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> course, the trajectory 
              where <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> theory is going today. And that is, 
              trying to build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s which can navigate and roam in our world, 
              and two, robots which can make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> out of the world.&#160; However, 
              there's another divergent path one might take, and that's to harness 
              the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is still very 
              primitive. At the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we can barely build arrays of atoms. 
              We cannot yet build the first atomic gear, for example. No one has 
              created an atomic wheel with ball bearings. So simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              which even children can play with in their toy sets, don't yet exist 
              at the atomic level.&#160; However, on a scale of decades, we may be 
              able to create atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that begin to mimic our own <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.</p>
<p>Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s can already be made. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">Nanotubes</a> allow us to 
              create strands of material that are super-strong. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              is still in its infancy and therefore, it's still premature to say 
              where <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will go. However, one place where <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              may go is inside our body. Already, it's possible to create a pill 
              the size of an aspirin pill that has a television camera that can 
              photograph our insides as it goes down our gullet, which means that 
              one day surgery may become relatively obsolete.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, it's conceivable we may have atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that 
              enter the blood. And these atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be the size of blood 
              cells and perhaps they would be able to perform useful functions 
              like regulating and sensing our health, and perhaps zapping <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> 
              cells and viruses in the process. However, this is still <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              fiction, because at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we can't even build simple 
              atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s yet.</p>
<h2><b>Are we living in a simulation?</b></h2>
<p><i><b>Is there any possibility, similar to the premise of The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, 
              that we are living in a simulation?</b></i></p>
<p>Well, philosophically speaking, it's always possible that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              is a <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, and it's always possible that our <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> with 
              our friends is a by-product of the pickle that we had last night 
              that upset our stomach. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is based upon reproducible 
              evidence. When we go to sleep and we wake up the next day, we usually 
              wind up in the same <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. It is reproducible. No <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how 
              we try to avoid certain unpleasant situations, they come back to 
              us. That is reproducible. So <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, as we commonly believe it 
              to exist, is a reproducible <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, it's a reproducible sensation. 
              Therefore in principle, you could never rule out the fact that the 
              world could be a <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, but the fact of the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              as it exists is a reproducible <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. </p>
<p>Now, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation was run so that virtual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> became reproducible. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you woke up, you woke up 
              in that same <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. That <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, of course, does not 
              violate the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. There's nothing in <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> or the 
              quantum theory that says that the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> is not possible. However, 
              the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power necessary to drive the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> necessary for a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a> is centuries to millennia 
              beyond anything that we can conceive of, and therefore this is something 
              for an advanced Type I or II&#160;civilization. </p>
<p><i><b>Why is a Type I required to run this kind of simulation? 
              Is <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> crunching the problem?</b></i></p>
<p>Yes, it's simply a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> crunching. At the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 
              we scientists simply do not know how to <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              You see, one of the problems is, the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, strictly speaking, is 
              not a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> at all. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> is a black box with an input tape and an output

<p>Many people find this hard to believe, but there's no <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, 
              there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>, there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming for 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a vast collection, perhaps a hundred billion 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> with 10,000 connections, which slowly and painfully 
              interacts with the environment. Some neural pathways are genetically 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to give us <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>. However, for the most part, our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cerebral_cortex_entry.html">cerebral cortex</a> has to be reprogrammed every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we bump into <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. 
            </p>
<p>As a consequence, we cannot simply put a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> in our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that 
              augments our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and enhances our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, 
              we now realize, is distributed throughout the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. For 
              example, it's possible to have people with only half a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. There 
              was a documented case recently where a young girl had half her <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              removed and she's still fully functional.</p>
<p>So, the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> can operate with half of its mass removed. However, 
              you remove one <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> in your Pentium <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and the whole 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> dies. So, there's a fundamental difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s--which are easily <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med, which are modular, and you

              where <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> is distributed throughout the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, making 
              it extremely difficult to reprogram. That is the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why, even 
              if we could create an advanced PlayStation that would run simulations 
              on a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> screen, that <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> cannot simply be injected into the

<p>Yes, that sounds interesting. But <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> will have collapsed 
              by then, so we'll have a little breather. In 20 years <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the 
              quantum theory takes over, so <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> collapses and we'll probably 
              stagnate for a few decades after that. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, which states 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power doubles every 18 months, will not last forever. 
              The quantum theory giveth, the quantum theory taketh away. The quantum 
              theory makes possible <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, which can be etched by ultraviolet 
              rays onto smaller and smaller chips of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>. This process will 
              end in about 15 to 20 years. The senior <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers at Intel now admit 
              for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that, yes, they are facing the end.</p>
<p>The thinnest layer on a Pentium <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> consists of about 20 atoms. 
              When we start to hit five atoms in the thinnest layer of a Pentium 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, the quantum theory takes over, <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s can now tunnel outside 
              the layer, and the Pentium <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> short-<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s. Therefore, within 
              a 15 to 20 year <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> frame, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> could collapse, and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> 
              Valley could become a Rust Belt. </p>
<p>This means that we physicists are desperately trying to create 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> for the post-<a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> era. This means using quantum 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_dot_entry.html">quantum dot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/optical_computer_entry.html">optical computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s,

              when <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> collapses in 15 to 20 years. The <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> of nations 
              depends upon the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that will replace the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>. 
            </p>
<p>This also means that you cannot project <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              exponentially into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Some people think that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> 
              will extend forever; in which case humans will be reduced to zoo 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s and our <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> creations will throw peanuts at us and make 
              us dance behind bars. Now, that may eventually happen. It is certainly 
              consistent within the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. </p>
<p>However, the laws of the quantum theory say that we're going to 
              face a massive problem 15 to 20 years from now. Now, some remedial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s have been proposed; for example, building cubical chips, 
              chips that are stacked on chips to create a 3-dimensional array. 
              However, the problem there is heat production. Tremendous quantities 
              of heat are produced by cubical chips, such that you can fry an 
              egg on top of a cubical <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>. Therefore, I firmly believe that we 
              may be able to squeeze a few more years out of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, perhaps 
              designing clever cubical chips that are super-cooled, perhaps using 
              x-rays to etch our chips instead of ultraviolet rays. However, that 
              only delays the inevitable. Sooner or later, the quantum theory 
              kills you. Sooner or later, when we hit five atoms, we don't know 
              where the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> is anymore, and we have to go to the next generation, 
              which relies on the quantum theory and atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. </p>
<p>Therefore, I say that all bets are off in terms of projecting <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> beyond a 20-year <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> frame. There's nothing in the 
              laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> that says that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s cannot exceed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              All I raise is that we physicists are desperately trying to patch 
              up <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, and at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we have to admit that we 
              have no successor to <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, which means that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> will 
              collapse in 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p><i><b>So are you saying that <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> and nanocomputing 
              are not likely to be available by then?</b></i></p>
<p>No, no, I'm just saying it's very difficult. At the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              we physicists have been able to compute on seven atoms. That is 
              the world's record for a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. And that quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              was able to calculate 3 x 5 = 15. Now, being able to calculate 3 
              x 5 = 15 does not equal the convenience of a laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that 
              can crunch potentially millions of calculations per second. The 
              problem with quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s is that any contamination, any atomic 
              disturbance, disturbs the alignment of the atoms and the atoms then 
              collapse into randomness. This is extremely difficult, because any 
              cosmic ray, any air <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>, any disturbance can conceivably destroy 
              the coherence of our atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to make them useless.</p>
<p><i><b>Unless you have redundant parallel computing?</b></i></p>
<p><a name="OLE_LINK3"><font color="#000000">Even if you have parallel 
              computing you still have to have each parallel computer component 
              free of any disturbance.</font> </a>So, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how you cut it, 
              the practical problems of building quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, although within 
              the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, are extremely difficult, because it requires 
              that we remove all in contact with the environment at the atomic 
              level. In practice, we've only been able to do this with a handful 
              of atoms, meaning that quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are still a gleam in the 
              eye of most physicists. </p>
<p>Now, if a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be successfully built, it would, 
              of course, scare the CIA and all the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s of the world, because 
              it would be able to crack any <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> created by a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>. 
              A quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would be able to perform calculations that are 
              inconceivable by a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>. Calculations that require an 
              infinite amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> can be calculated in 
              a few seconds by a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. For example, if you shine <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> 
              beams on a collection of coherent atoms, the <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beam scatters, 
              and in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> performs a quantum calculation, which exceeds 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> capability of any <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>.</p>
<p>However, as I mentioned, the problem is that these atoms have to 
              be in perfect coherence, and the problems of doing this are staggering 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that even a random collision with a <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> 
              could in fact destroy the coherence and make the quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              impractical. </p>
<p>So, I'm not saying that it's impossible to build a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>; 
              I'm just saying that it's awfully difficult.</p>
<h2><b>SETI: looking in the wrong direction</b></h2>
<p><i><b>When do you think we might expect <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> [Search for <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">Extraterrestrial</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>] to be successful?</b></i></p>
<p>I personally think that <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> is looking in the wrong direction. 
              If, for example, we're walking down a country road and we see an 
              anthill, do we go down to the ant and say, "I bring you trinkets, 
              I bring you beads, I bring you <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, I bring you <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, 
              I bring you nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, take me to your leader"? Or, 
              do we simply step on them? Any <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> capable of reaching 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> would be perhaps a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. And the 
              difference between you and the ant is comparable to the distance 
              between you and a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. Therefore, for the most 
              part, a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> would operate with a completely different 
              agenda and message than our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. </p>
<p>Let's say that a ten-lane superhighway is being built next to the 
              anthill. The question is: would the ants even know what a ten-lane 
              superhighway is, or what it's used for, or how to communicate with 
              the workers who are just feet away? And the answer is no. One question 
              that we sometimes ask is if there is a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> in 
              our backyard, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/milky_way_entry.html">Milky Way</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>, would we even know its presence? 
              And if you think about it, you realize that there's a good chance 
              that we, like ants in an anthill, would not understand or be able 
              to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of a ten-lane superhighway next door.</p>
<p>So this means there that could very well be a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> 
              in our <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>, it just means that we're not smart enough to find 
              one. Now, a Type III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is not going to make contact by 
              sending Captain Kirk on the Enterprise to meet our leader. A Type 
              III <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> would send self-replicating Von Neumann probes 
              to colonize the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a> with robots. For example, consider a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> only consists of thousands of atoms. It's a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> in 
              some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. But in about one week, it can colonize an entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              being made of trillions of cells. How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, a Von Neumann probe would be a self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that 
              lands on a moon; a moon, because they are stable, with no erosion, 
              and they're stable for billions of years. The probe would then make 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> copies of itself by the millions. It would create a factory 
              to build copies of itself. And then these probes would then rocket 
              to other nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, land on moons, to create a million 
              more copies by building a factory on that moon. Eventually, there 
              would be sphere surrounding the mother <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, expanding at near-<a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>, containing trillions of these Von Neumann probes, and 
              that is perhaps the most efficient way to colonize the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>. This 
              means that perhaps, on our moon there is a Von Neumann probe, left 
              over from a visitation that took place million of years ago, and 
              the probe is simply waiting for us to make the transition from Type 
              0 to Type I. </p>
<p><i><b>The Sentinel.</b></i></p>
<p>Yes. This, of course, is the basis of the movie <i>2001,</i> because 
              at the beginning of the movie, Kubrick interviewed many prominent 
              scientists, and asked them the question, "What is the most 
              likely way that an advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> would probe the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>?" 
              And that is, of course, through self-replicating Von Neumann probes, 
              which create moon bases. That is the basis of the movie <i>2001,</i> 
              where the probe simply waits for us to become interesting. If we're 
              Type 0, we're not very interesting. We have all the savagery and 
              all the suicidal tendencies of fundamentalism, nationalism, sectarianism, 
              that are sufficient to rip apart our world. </p>
<p>By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we've become Type I, we've become interesting, we've 
              become <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary, we begin to resolve our differences. We have centuries 
              in which to exist on a single <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> to create a paradise on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>,

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>There are many inherent problems with the methods and foundations of the modern quest of Physics to Unify the forces of Nature.  
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Today, we physicists are embarking upon the greatest quest of all, which is to unify all four of these forces into a single comprehensive theory. The first force, gravity, is now represented by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which gives us the Big Bang, black holes, and expanding universe.  </p></center>
<br>
&#133;all of which are nonsensical conclusions from a nonsensical premise.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<br>
The following is from an introduction to M-Theory, which reveals many of the problems with the &#145;string&#146; approach.
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080616073350/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/qg_ss.html" target="_blank">http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/qg_ss.ht  ml</a>
<br>
<br>
&#147;The standard model was designed within a framework known as Quantum Field Theory (QFT), &#133;. But unfortunately the fourth interaction, gravity, beautifully described by Einstein's General Relativity (GR), does not seem to fit into this scheme. Whenever one tries to apply the rules of QFT to GR one gets results which make no sense. For instance, the force between two gravitons (the particles that mediate gravitational interactions), becomes infinite and we do not know how to get rid of these infinities to get physically sensible results.&#148;
<br>
<br>
First of all General Relativity did not explain the mechanism of gravity.  It merely gave us the abstract image of warped space and the tautology of the rubber-sheet analogy (which uses gravity itself to explain gravity).  There was and is no accepted explanation of what physically is the cause for the gravitational field which is visualized abstractly as the &#147;shape of space&#148;. There is no evidence for the hypothetical &#147;graviton&#148; or any other force-mediating-particle or particle-mediated-force.  
<br>
<br>
The problem with the standard model, that string theory is attempting to reconcile, is the nonsensical conception of the point-particle.  The calculations of the forces between two &#147;particles&#148; become theoretically infinite because they are using the mathematical fantasy of the &#147;point-particle&#148; as their model for the &#147;fundamental particle&#148;.  These so-called point-particles are "infinitely" small thus they can approach each other indefinitely, ever increasing their inter-attractive forces without ever touching each other.  This is the age-old problem of trying to quantify the continuum, as explained in Zeno&#146;s paradox.  If you are going to use point-particles to escape the necessity of physical extension and then use those extensionless particles for explaining phenomena in extended space then you are going to run into problems, because you are trying to marry two separate realms: the non-existent realm of physically extensionless points, with the existent realm of physically extended matter.  In reality a particle with zero extension does not exist!  Its negation is implicit in its own definition.
<br>
<br>
To deal with those infinities which are a result of a faulty premise of the point-particle, Physics has invented a trick called &#147;renormalization&#148;, which is simply a method of replacing those errors (infinities) with the correct observational data.  It is now common-place to hear physicists speak of &#147;renormalizability&#148; as a necessary component of any correct theory!  It has become considered a positive and necessary attribute of any theory!
<br>
<br>
String theory deals with this problem by giving a pseudo extension to the point-particle and it replaces it with a loop of &#147;string&#148;, a mathematical radius, which also possess zero-dimensionality in its width, thus it also does not exist.
<br>
<br>
Another M-Theory excerpt:
<br>
&#147;One of the most remarkable predictions of String Theory is that space-time has ten dimensions!&#148;
<br>
<br>
Space-time does not have dimension.  It is the finite human mind which must compartmentalize nature into the quantifiable parameters called dimension.  The M-theorists are concretizing a mental abstraction and tucking it neatly away beneath the quantum level where it can never be seen or experimentally verified.  It is a big mistake to base a theory on an unverifiable, misinterpreted and concretized mental-abstraction. Has anyone ever SEEN a dimension or observed its physical actions?  That is because there is no such thing as a dimension in the real physical world.  
<br>
<br>
The main problem with modern physics is in the tacit assumption of the atom-in-the-void inherited from the ancient Greeks, the programmed obsession of breaking things down to an ultimate, quantifiable, non-structured thus indivisible particle residing an intervening void. In contradiction to this atomic schema our experiments reveal that ALL of the so-far revealed/manufactured subatomic particles have deeper level complexities manifested in their wave nature interactions and their fluid inter-convertibility.  They are harmonic resonances and fluid-dynamic effects in a continuous medium.
<br>
<br>
M-theory is a VERY complex method for patching together incorrect Relativity Theory and incomplete Quantum Theory.  However, there is a much simpler, more coherent and thus humanly understandable, alternative method for the unification of ALL the disparate forces, but it requires a fundamental paradigm-shift from an underlying overly simplistic kinetic-atomic substrate to a more complex fluid-dynamic-continuum substrate.  This shift in foundation from abstract, nonunified and overly-simplistic toward realistic, more complex, holistic and fluid-dynamic ultimately enables simpler, more coherent higher-level constructions to be built, thus rendering the whole of physics visualizable and thus humanly understandable. With the proper foundation, all of the complex ad-hoc kludges to get the disparate (and desperate ;) compartments of modern physics to fit are rendered superfluous. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  It's a theory of the very large; it's a theory of smooth, space-time manifolds like bedsheets and trampoline nets. </p></center>
<br>
&#147;space-time&#148; is an abstraction for &#147;matter in motion&#148;.  There is no such thing as a void with properties.  The &#147;quantum vacuum&#148; is an abstract mathematical rendering of the basic level of fluid-dynamic frictionless matter.  It is now known that the &#147;vacuum&#148; can be mathematically described as a zero-energy superfluid.  If the mathematics says it is a superfluid then perhaps it actually is!  Maybe it is not a vacuum at all but the fundamental level of continuous fluid reality?

<br>
The Evidence for the Fluid Nature of Fundamental Physical Reality
<br>
<br>
Consider this scientific finding from 1999 as reported on Science Daily at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080616073350/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990730072958.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/99073  0072958.htm</a>
<br>
<br>
Superfluid Is Shown To Have Property Of A Solid
<br>
EVANSTON, Ill. --- Northwestern University physicists have for the first time shown that superfluid helium-3 -- the lighter isotope of helium, which is a liquid that has lost all internal friction, allowing it to flow without resistance and ooze through tiny spaces that normal liquids cannot penetrate -- actually behaves like a solid in its ability to conduct sound waves. The finding, reported in the July 29 issue of the journal Nature, is the first demonstration in a liquid of the 'acoustic Faraday effect,' a response of sound waves to a magnetic field that is exactly analogous to the response of light waves to a magnetic field first observed in 1845 by British scientist Michael Faraday. The acoustic effect provides conclusive proof of the existence of transverse sound waves -- which are characteristic of solids but not of liquids -- in superfluid helium-3. 
<br>
&#133;
<br>
"I wouldn't say that our discovery is of that magnitude [says William Halperin. (if only he knew!)], but it is significant as the first observation of a previously unknown mode of wave propagation in a liquid -- one that is of the type you would expect to see in a solid."
<br>
<br>
Transverse waves in a fluid?  Ah ha!  Now do you see where this new observational fact conflicts with the historical reasoning underlying the foundational assumption of the classical conception of the ether as a solid, luminiferous substance? 
<br>
<br>
Remember that it was thought, in the 1800's, that a fluid body could not transmit transverse waves.  This was the entire reason behind the counter-intuitive assumption that the ether was a solid with the elastic properties of steel, through which all objects somehow moved with zero friction (another property of a superfluid).  Imagine if it had been known in the 1800's that fluids could transmit transverse waves.  Even if the scientists at the time would have still (for some inconceivable reason) initially concluded that the ether was a steel-like solid, when Michelson and Morley came around and showed this reasoning to be false the scientists would have taken the easier road (much easier, conceptually, than abandoning the medium of the light-waves and electromagnetic-fields themselves and the ensuing nonsense of the entire Theory of Relativity as well) and simply reformulated the ether as an inhomogenous fluid instead of an isotropic, solid-steel-ghost-like, absolute frame of reference for the motion of all objects.  There would have been nothing to stop this inevitable conclusion from being reached and there would be no reason to assume that the fluid ether could not move WITH the M&amp;M laboratory and the Earth itself instead of through it and relative to it.  The null results would merely have made that conclusion inevitable, had the accumulation of the facts happened in an optimal succession.  In such a scenario, the ether wouldn&#146;t have been abandoned which would have left intact the conceptual underpinnings, the luminiferous medium, of the theory of electromagnetism and light.  Physics would not have needed to abandon causality and adopt randomness and probability in its place as the &#147;medium&#148; of the wave-nature of all matter. Of course we can&#146;t know the details of the Physics we would now have, had the course of events happened in the optimal sequence, but it is readily apparent that the difference would be great indeed.
<br>
<br>
Do you see now, how the sequence of the discovery of facts has drastically influenced the flow of scientific &#145;progress&#146;?   Do you see that this non-optimal, linear sequence has actually generated an historical scientific error and that the &#147;Revolution&#148; known as &#147;Modern Physics&#148; was merely an erroneous reaction against, and a consequence of, this simple historical error?  Of course we can&#146;t change history itself, but we can surely overcome the inevitable errors of its linear flow!  In retrospect, with a more complete collection of the critical pieces of the puzzle now in hand, the answer to the classical dilemma culminating in the Michelson and Morley experiment, is quite simple.  If hind-sight is 20/20 then let us use this neglected heightening of historical scientific vision and declare right now a revision of the errors of history, &#147;The ether is a dynamic fluid!&#148;  
<br>
<br>
[&#133;]
<br>
<br>
It is becoming more and more apparent that even in the darkness of the abandonment of understanding, the &#147;Standard Model&#148; of Physics appears to be steadily groping its way toward the fluid-dynamic nature of fundamental physical reality&#151;the dynamic &#147;ether&#148; vaguely intuited by Albert Einstein [see &#147;Ether and the Theory of Relativity&#148; by Albert Einstein, an address delivered on May 5th, 1920, University of Leyden].  Despite coming from a faulty conceptual paradigm which it must eventually abandon altogether, Physics is slowly and blindly modeling its path, by experiment and equation, toward the alternate fluid-dynamic route that it did not have the initial framework to sufficiently formulate or accept at the crucial historical bifurcation point of the Michelson and Morley experiment.  Physics is undergoing a slow oscillation back towards the distant beginnings of the ungrasped thread of understanding that it had lost sight of&#151;the concept of the fluid ether as the medium of the wave nature of all matter and &#147;space&#148;.  The actual &#147;thread of error&#148; goes much deeper than the simple error mentioned above.  This thread &#147;permeates all the branches of the existing tree of knowledge&#148;.   It goes right down to the ancient Greek foundations of science&#151;to the very coalescence of the fundamental framework of the standard paradigm of physical reductionism itself&#151;straight to the core, kinetic-atomic foundation and the never-ending &#145;quest for the fundamental particle of matter&#146;&#151;the a-tom existing and acting in the always-hypothetical &#145;void&#146;.   This thread of error manifests itself as a wide-spread and self-limiting set of incorrect and artificial categories and concepts that render the most qualitatively simple of subjects, not only impossible to truly understand, but also extremely difficult to discuss and theorize about.  Take for instance this quote from G.E. Volovik in &#147;The Universe in a Helium Droplet&#148;  .
<br>
<br>
&#147;According to the modern view the elementary particles (electrons, neutrinos, quarks, etc.) are excitations of some more fundamental medium called the quantum vacuum. This is the new ether of the 21st century. The electromagnetic and gravitational fields, as well as the fields transferring the weak and the strong interactions, all represent different types of collective motion of the quantum vacuum.
<br>
&#147;Among the existing condensed matter systems, the particular quantum liquid&#151;superfluid 3He-A&#151;most closely resembles the quantum vacuum of the Standard Model. This is the collection of 3He atoms condensed into the liquid state like water. But as distinct from water, the behavior of this liquid is determined by the quantum mechanical zero-point motion of atoms. Due to the large amplitude of this motion the liquid does not solidify even at zero temperature.&#148; 
<br>
<br>
In the entire first paragraph, we can see the current trend of the Standard Model of Physics toward the conception of the &#145;vacuum&#146; as a &#145;zero-energy superfluid&#146; or &#145;quantum liquid&#146;.  Apart from the erroneous conceptual structure of the Standard Model and the superficial denial of the material substance that the fluid equations attempt to quantify, despite all of these very important considerations, this basic quantitative conception of the fundamental level of physical reality as a &#145;quantum liquid&#146; or &#145;superfluid&#146;, is not really so far off from the basic foundational conception of the fluid-dynamic continuum of matter proposed in Sorce Theory.  The small conceptual differences that do exist at this foundational level of the standard model, however, are CRUCIAL to the correct understanding of Nature. 
<br>
<br>
Further down in the second paragraph the meaning of the explanation gets obscured and highly distorted by the esoteric theoretical &#145;baggage&#146;, the erroneous and artificial categories and knowledge partitions inherent in the Standard Model.  The entry point to the crucial error is exposed in the last two quoted sentences of the passage, &#147;&#133;the behavior of this liquid is determined by the quantum mechanical zero-point motion of atoms&#148;.  So as the liquid cools down, according to the kinetic-atomic theory of heat, the atoms or molecules will slow down their billiard-ball like collisions until, at the point of absolute zero, they will cease motion altogether.  This is what is meant by the phrase &#147;zero-point motion&#148;.  The next sentence goes on to say &#147;Due to the large amplitude of this motion the liquid does not solidify even at zero temperature&#148;.  It should be obvious, at this point that a &#147;large amplitude&#148; of &#147;zero-point motion&#148; is an absurdity!  How can the lack of oscillatory motion possess an amplitude?  How can the physicists routinely get away with such nonsense?  Of course you physicists know the simple answer to that seemingly naive question, it is through an appeal to quantum uncertainty of course! 
<br>
<br>
Heisenbergs&#146; Uncertainty Principal states that as the knowledge of the velocity of a quantum-scale object gets more and more precise, the knowledge of its position, gets less and less precise.  It is a directly inverse relation.  So as the velocity of each individual atom decreases, the amplitude of our uncertainty (whatever this physically means) of its actual position steadily increases!  In effect, our knowledge of the positions of the atoms gets fuzzier and fuzzier simply because we know that they are slowing down!  Despite the obvious (discarded) &#147;common-sense&#148; recognition that the amplitude of the state of knowledge (?!) of the motion of the individual atoms should have nothing to do with the actual functioning of the quantum level (or any level) of reality, and despite the fact that we haven&#146;t even measured the motions of any of the actual individual atoms and thus we don&#146;t really know that their individual motions have actually slowed down or ceased at all, except through recourse to our interpretive theoretical kinetic-atomic model of heat which for almost all other types of molecules would state that it should become a frozen solid and not a superfluid at that temperature&#151;despite all these rather important problems the fact is that the Uncertainty Principle tells us absolutely nothing of the PHYSICAL mechanisms which should explain how the lack of liquid-defining inter-atomic collisions, does not instantly render the super-cooled liquid Helium, into a frozen solid crystal&#151;a Helium popsicle.  After-all, a decrease in inter-atomic collisions is the defining property of a solid, according to the kinetic-atomic theory and this is why the discovery of superfluid helium-4, back in 1937 was a complete and total surprise to the experimentalists and is still considered &#147;counterintuitive&#148; based on the standard model of heat and its relation to the states of matter.   
<br>
<br>
What has Heisenbergs&#146; Uncertainty Principal really to do with all of this anyway?  As this book will demonstrate, the Uncertainty Relations are a consequence of the standard lack of understanding of what an atom really is, what it is made of and what those &#145;constituents&#146; are made of as well.   This ignorance begins at the core level of physical reality which lies beneath the probabilities and uncertainties of quantum mechanics and permeates into the very nature of our understanding of the &#145;fundamental&#146; forces, energy, the quantum, thermo-dynamics, the states of matter, and much else.  That is why an appeal to uncertainty, in the standard &#145;explanation&#146; of superfluidity, must be made in order to reconcile the surprise appearance of superfluidity with the absence of &#147;kinetic-atomic motion&#148; currently known as &#147;heat&#148;.  The scientists really are uncertain as to what physicaly causes all phenomena at the quantum level and this uncertainty propagates its way pervasively into the &#145;understanding&#146; of macroscale phenomena as well!  
<br>
<br>
Despite all of the various manifestations of the deep qualitative, interpretive errors of Modern Physics, the equations which have been custom fit to model the results of our experimental contact with physical reality, actually tell a quite different story.
<br>
In &#147;The Big Bang Never Happened&#148;  , Eric J. Lerner writes, 
<br>
"... since the nineteenth century it's been recognized that the equations of electromagnetism are almost identical with the equations of hydrodynamics the equations governing fluid flow. Even more curious, Schr&#246;dinger's equation, the basic equation of quantum mechanics, is also closely related to equations of fluid flow. Since 1954 many scientists have shown that a particle moving under the influence of random impacts from irregularities in a fluid will obey Schr&#246;dinger's equation.
<br>
<br>
&#147;More recently, in the late seventies, researchers found another curious correspondence while developing mathematical laws that govern the motion of line vortices--the hydrodynamic analogs of the plasma filaments .... The governing equation turns out to be a modified form of Schr&#246;dinger's equation, called the nonlinear Schr&#246;dinger equation. [This equation is a central part of the study of &#145;quantum liquids&#146; as well.  The interesting coincidence is that it is a modified form of the equation describing the shell structure of an atom.]
<br>
<br>
&#147;Generally in science when two different phenomena obey the same or very similar mathematical laws, it means that in all probability they are somehow related. Thus it seems likely that both electromagnetism and quantum phenomena generally may be connected to some sort of hydrodynamics on a microscopic level. But this clue, vague as it is, leaves entirely open the key question of what the nuclear particles are. And what keeps them together? How can fluids generate particles?  [This book will fill in these crucial gaps.]
<br>
<br>
&#147;But the idea of particles formed from vortices in some fluid is certainly worth investigating. (This is a real return to Ionian ideas: the idea of reality being formed out of vortices was first raised by Anaxagoras 2,500 years ago!) &#133;However, I think there are additional clues, some developed from my own work, which indicate that plasma processes and quantum mechanical processes are in some way related.
<br>
<br>
&#147;First and foremost are Krisch's experimental results on spin-aligned protons.  Qualitatively, the results clearly imply that protons are actually some form of vortex, like a plasmoid.  Such vortices interact far more strongly when they are spinning in the same direction-which is certainly the behavior Krisch observed in proton collisions. Because vortex behavior would become evident only in near-collisions, the effects should be more pronounced at higher energies and in more head-on interactions&#151;again, in accordance with Krisch's results.
<br>
<br>
&#147;A second clue lies in particle asymmetry (see p. 336). Particles act as if they have a "handedness," and the simplest dynamic process or object that exhibits an inherent orientation is a vortex. Moreover, right-and left-handed vortices annihilate each other, just as particles and antiparticles do."
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> So today, we realize that a true Unified Field Theory must be bizarre, must be fantastic, incredible, mind-boggling, crazy, because all the sane alternatives have been studied and discarded.  </p></center>
<br>
That is simply not true. Sorce Theory has NEVER been studied or understood by the &#147;establishment&#148;.  Its time has come.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi subtillioN,
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I want to clarify this minor point about the "Uncertainty Principle."  (Can't resist. :)
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Heisenbergs&#146; Uncertainty Principal states that as the knowledge of the velocity of a quantum-scale object gets more and more precise, the knowledge of its position, gets less and less precise. It is a directly inverse relation. So as the velocity of each individual atom decreases, the amplitude of our uncertainty (whatever this physically means) of its actual position steadily increases! In effect, our knowledge of the positions of the atoms gets fuzzier and fuzzier simply because we know that they are slowing down!  </p></center>
<br>
Heisenberg's Principle involves the inability for any observation to resolve, simultaneously, two certain measures, but they are not position and velocity, but rather position and momentum.
<br>
<br>
Momentum is the product of mass and velocity.  on a "slippery surface", a 10 kg mass sliding at 1 meter per second represents the same momentum as a 1 kg mass sliding at 10 meters per second.  If you are required to bring each to a complete stop in T seconds, you will need to apply equal force to each during that period of time (in the direction opposing their motion, of course.)
<br>
<br>
F = ma.  If the two masses are at rest, and you apply an equal force to each for some period of time T, "ma" will remain equal for each as well.  The one with 10 times the mass will be observed to accelerate at only 1/10 the rate (gain velocity at 1/10 the rate.)
<br>
<br>
This is a "core way" to determine the mass of an object.  Works as well in the "weightlessness" of space as in my living room.
<br>
<br>
When we deal with "macroscopic" objects, one can ascertain their "mass" another way.  Because the "acceleration due to gravity" is relatively constant near the earths surface, (and the SAME for both masses), it must be the Force (weight) that reflects the difference.  So just put the objects on a scale, and you can infer their mass quite well.
<br>
<br>
But it is very hard to place a proton or neutron on a scale.  So we revert to the previous method.  We place them in motion, and infer the mass by taking careful note of how their "rate of motion" changes under application of a given force.
<br>
<br>
This requires the measurement of a "change in velocity", or change in position per unit time, under a known application of force.
<br>
<br>
To get a more accurate read on the change, it is best to have that velocity change rather greatly.  This means at one point or another, it is moving fast, relatively.  But to determine velocity accurately, one must know position at each point of time with accuracy.
<br>
<br>
If the object is not moving, you can know its position perfectly (AND its velocity, 0).  However, you cannot measure its mass at all, because this is to be inferred from its momentum (mass*velocity), and as it tend to "no velocity", it tends to "no momentum" due to "v".  Information about "m" is lost.
<br>
<br>
Alternately, imagine a "particle" of some kind coasting by.  You apply a measured force (EM, say) for a measured time, and you WANT to measure the change in velocity to accuracy, in order to infer the mass. Apply a tiny force, and the state of motion changes so little, you cannot get much accuracy.  Apply a larger force, and there will be a greater difference between "original state of motion" and "final state of motion".  Unfortunately, one (or both) of these represent velocity great enough that the precise position of the "before" or the "after", at the endpoint of the time T whereby the force was applied, become harder to ascertain.
<br>
<br>
The formula:
<br>
<br>
  (delta x)*(delta mv) &gt;= planck's constant &gt; 0
<br>
<br>
(x is position, "mv" is momentum), and "delta" means an uncertainty, as in "RANGE OF VALUES" in each, like "plus or minus 3 nanomemters".
<br>
<br>
Since a "delta x" is a LENGTH, L, and a "delta mv" is a "MASS*LENGTH/TIME" (or M*L/T, planck's constant has the units MLL/T, which happen to be units of angular momentum.
<br>
<br>
Unlike linear momentum, there is an extra factor of L, because the momentum of a spinning mass depends not only on the mass, and the rotation rate ("radians/time") but also on the distribution of mass, according to the "mean squared" distance from the center of rotation.

Good point, but it does not alter the meaning of the quoted passage.  The problem is that they are looking for a mathematical point particle where there is only a real physical pressure/density gradient of basic matter.

I say you have a magnficent problematically Predictive but mechanically false edifice-- that will eventually collapse without a single individual-- no matter how academically endowed--having the slightest gut feel for the Real World of Einstein's finally completed, unified force gravity theory! The simple algebraic feld equation is G - R/3(v-squared) where 3 stands for the simplest and sufficient 3 dimensions of space and time is ticked by the rate of spin of R as a gravity field volume of space whose closed curvature at any given point on its replacement sphere surface, is a G-size Higgs particle Black Hole. R can be the dynamic replacment sphere surface of an atom or of the visile cosmos, and every interactively nested gravity field entity in between.

<br>
No, it's been falsified several times.  It doesn't explain the results of Dayton Miller's ether drift tests, which have been verified a few years back by a team of south american scientists.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> The 'rubber sheet' analogy is not a tautology... </p></center>
<br>
Yes it is.  It uses gravitation to explain gravitation.  How is that not a tautology?
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> ..., it is an inescapable conclusion of the confirmed fact that the speed of light remains constant regardless of whether or not you are moving in any direction. </p></center>
<br>
No such "confirmed fact" exists.  That is what Dayton Miller falsified.  Only at the surface of the earth in a laboratory with thick solid walls does such a fact get confirmed.  The higher you go into the atmosphere, Miller observed, the greater the ether drift.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  Also, bare in mind that this analogy is merely employed to allow non-experts to have some small idea of how Einstein's theory works. </p></center>
<br>
Right, but the point is that the theory does not explain the workings of gravitation.  It merely provides a kludge to fudge the maths so they fit with the MM results...ignoring the extensive analysis by Miller et. al.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  Finding a flaw in the equations of GR is one thing, but attaking the analogy will no more debunk it than complaining 'genes cannot be selfish, Dawkins!' debunks the theory of evolution. </p></center>
<br>
Yep.  Clearly.  The point is to demonstrate that the tautological visualization does not explain gravity. 
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> That said, maybe there is a better way of visualising the equations of GR that we have yet to describe? </p></center>
<br>
There certainly is, and it fits ALL the known facts, not just some of them and ignoring the rest.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> And it is not surprising that no evidence exists for the graviton, seeing as it would require a particle accelerator the size of a galaxy to probe to a depth sufficient to find it. </p></center>

The fact that the qualitative explanation of gravity in relativity theory breaks down into tautology tells me on the surface that the theory is only a quantitative kludge.  But I have seen deeper.

'Yes it is. It uses gravitation to explain gravitation. How is that not a tautology?'.
<br>
<br>
It does no such thing. What GR does is show us that the question 'what is the 'force' of gravity?' needs to be rephrased. There is no force of gravity. The Earth is moving in a straight line because of its inertia, but its path does not look straight to us because we cannot see the warping of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. It is rather like the centrifugal 'force' that, when your car goes round a sharp bend, appears to pull you outwards toward the door. Again, an illusion of perspective. Anyone observing you and the car from outside can see the car follows a curved path and you are continuing in a straight line under your 'inertia'. 
<br>
<br>
The rubber sheet analogy is only partially succeful at modelling 4D spacetime. It's biggest shortcoming is the fact that if you place a bowling ball on a trampoline it is pulled down by the gravitational 'force' of the Earth. This leads people to ask 'Ok so what 'pulls down' the Sun when we place it on the fabric of spacetime?' which is, of course, completely misunderstanding the relationsip between gravity and acceleration.
<br>
<br>
Well I should not pursue this too much because, really my understanding of GR is very superficial and what I know of whatever you are referring to is basically nil. At this point it is hard for me to know who is speaking knowledge and who is speaking nonesense. Do I trust the tens of thousands of experiments and experimenters who have tried to find a flaw in GR and come away empty-handed every time, or do I trust that some maverick (I assume this is not you personally, Sub) really has acquired a theory to overthrow Einstein?

I was just talking about the limits of GR.  That's it.  You don't need to learn Sorce Theory to see the limits.  Most scientists who have studied it are well aware that it does not give a causal description of the mechanism of gravitation.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> 'Yes it is. It uses gravitation to explain gravitation. How is that not a tautology?'.
<br>
<br>
It does no such thing. What GR does... </p></center>

I am talking about the ANALOGY, not GR itself, which is mainly maths.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> ... is show us that the question 'what is the 'force' of gravity?' needs to be rephrased. </p></center>
<br>
lol, yes, the attempts to phrase it in terms of causation had failed for centuries.  Let's abandon causal models entirely and, here, try this mathematical trick.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  There is no force of gravity. The Earth is moving in a straight line because of its inertia, but its path does not look straight to us because we cannot see the warping of spacetime caused by the presence of mass. </p></center>
<br>
The earth is moving in an elipse.  Don't let them pull the wool of abstraction over your eyes.  
<br>
<br>
But why is it moving in an elipse?  Because "spacetime is warped"?  Sure, but WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  HOW does mass warp spacetime?  WHAT is mass anyway?  These are the questions that GR glosses over with the abstraction of the curvature of spacetime.  It gives no mechanism, other than this abstraction, for the cause of gravitation.
<br>

<br>
Have you not read of the many gravitational anomalies?  Every one is a failure of a test of GR.  Google it.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to find out GR has its limits.  It is not complete.  It can't even give us the mechanism of gravitation, so why should we expect it to be?  Simply because the limits are not emphasized in your science classes?  That's unfortunate, yes, but that's the way it is.  You can't see the blind-spot from within the system.</p></td>

A better analogy (though clearly going too far the other direction) would be to compare it to all those sites which attempt to show gravity itself to be wrong.  It can't be done.  We have too much data that shows it to be the case, as we have with evolution.  But the details of the respective models are another thing altogether.  It should simply be expected that there will be anomalies for all our models, but showing those models incomplete (or incorrect) does not demonstrate the general idea---such as evolution or gravitation---to be incorrect.  So yes, sure there are anomalies, or unexplainable aspects, in both of our sets of models.  The question is what can we do with them?  Are there better models that explain them?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Occam's razor is getting pretty rusty.
<br>
<br>
Consider some concepts as food for thought:
<br>
<br>
Gravity is acceleration, specifically, for any given object, the "history" of accumulated accelerations including and since the Big Bang (or choose your own smaller Bang).
<br>
<br>
Space has no quantifiable properties. Our Cosmos is the expansion of matter into space. That expansion includes friction and rotation.
<br>
<br>
Matter is generic. What differentiates particles (atoms, molecules, photons, planets) is the behavior of generic matter at different scales (function of the history of that region of particles)
<br>
<br>
Humans are biased to see particles smaller than humans as subject to one set of laws and those larger than humans at another. Our size is probably arbitrary.
<br>
<br>
If we are living in an expanding universe (meaning not that space is mysteriously stretching but rather that highly compressed particles are expanding into space) then quantification (physical law) is -true- only for specified periods of the history of our Cosmos or any subset of the Cosmos.
<br>
<br>
All energy is (particles of)matter in motion. The behavior of the particles determines the nature of what we call energy.
<br>
<br>
Each of these statements appears to me to be consistent with observation and measurement of the known universe. They may contradict certain theories. perhaps some of the theories need to change.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I am not wedded to Big bang theory. Black holes seem to be evidence that the universe is "hydraulic", that is, capable of expanding in certain regions and contracting in others.
<br>
<br>
However, I take the simple evidence of the spiral nature of galaxies and solar systems as evidence that, at least regionally, objects are expanding. solids become gasses. Matter becomes energy(smaller particles at a different level of organization.)
<br>
<br>
The trust of my point is that it will be easier to find a general field theory, or discard the hope of finding one, if we lose the perspective of cosmic and microscopic, which are biases based on the accident of human scale.
<br>
<br>
Our human bias also wants to impart permanent "forms" to matter. But if the universe is, as it appears to be, a continuously evolving phenomenon then it behooves us to stop thinking of the universe as made up of interacting "things". There are no atoms of gold, for instance, only matter behaving like atoms of gold. Matter has a diverse repertoire of behaviors based on the scale of its particles, their relations to other particles and their history.
<br>
<br>
So there are no strings. There are also no muons or charmed quarks. But matter may "string" sometimes. If you smash it apart in certain ways it has a tendency to quark. certain particles, under the right conditions systematically congeal into human beings for short periods and then dissipate again in consonance with patterns of entropy in this region of the cosmos.
<br>
<br>
It's scary, but we need to let go of trying to say what the universe -is- and focus on what it -does-.</p></td>

It is the cat who catches the most mice that is the best cat regardless of its color or its name.
<br>
<br>
Sorce Theory *is* verifiable and verified by the equations of physics which directly model the fundamental quantum level as a zero-energy superfluid.  Thus the fundamental verified premise of Sorce Theory is already proven to exist.  That is how Physics finally becomes understandable by finally admitting that the quantum vacuum is not void at all, but is exactly what the equations show it to be, a frictionless, massless, compressible fluid.
<br>
<br>
Metaphysics is the understanding of physical reality.  Physics is devoid of this foundational level of understanding.  It is a mere quantitative accounting scheme.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Metaphysics has become a dirty word to physics.  This is because their faulty model has forced them to abandon causality and thus the foundation of understanding itself has been lost to them.

<br>
Even though Physics has a superficial disdain for metaphysics, it secretly practices it inspite of the fact that it has no fundamental level of understanding to start from.

Kaku says this,
<br>
"Today, we physicists are embarking upon the greatest quest of all, which is to unify all four of these forces into a single comprehensive theory. The first force, gravity, is now represented by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which gives us the Big Bang, black holes, and expanding universe. "
<br>
<br>
That quest is the quest of metaphysics.

String Theory *is* metaphysics.  It is just faulty at the core.  That is why it is MUCH more fantastical than the theory I am proposing.</p></td>

How difficult is it to make that kind of empty criticism about a theory that you do not understand?  Do you usually take the lazy way out and judge things based on a lack of understanding?

I am not the source of the Sorce, and to accuse me of being uninformed requires some statement to back it up otherwise it is simply your uninformed opinion.

I am informed of both the standard model and the alternative.  I can see the difference.  You only know the standard model.  You don't know the difference.

A theory has to start somewhere and technology hinges on our understanding of Nature.  That is the whole point to my "preaching".  It is an attempt to help the church of Physics to evolve out of these dark ages.</p></td>

Sorce Theory is a completely alternate thread of Physics.  It takes its conceptual departure before the tacit assumption of the ancient Greek Kinetic-atomic theory of Democritus and postulates that basic matter is continuous and compressible.  It makes a fundamental shift of core premises from the reductionist and multiple (and I am not saying that reductionism is wrong, per se) to the holistic and unified.  This shift turns out to be absolutely critical for a coherent and completely causal unification of all of physics. 
<br>
<br>
Sorce Theory takes the observational and quantitative data in all its details and gives fluid-dynamic and wave-mechanical explanations of all the fundamental forces of nature based on the familiar properties of a frictionless, continuous and compressible fluid&#151;modeled in the standard theory as the &#147;quantum vacuum&#148; which is a zero-energy superfluid (also called a &#147;quantum fluid&#148;).  Sorce Theory explains the mechanisms by which this fluid gets &#147;harmonically&#148; quantized (to brutally simplify it) into the atomic shell structure of atoms. [Note that it is well known that a superfluid readily produces "quantized vortices" that are indefinitely stable, or "meta-stable".] This complex causal set of descriptions is exactly consistent with the modern quantum equations, i.e. the Schrodinger Equation, which define the structure of the atom and the so-called &#147;wave-particle duality, but it goes much further and intrinsically explains the mechanisms of ALL the forces as a consequence of a basic continuous pressure in various configurations into wave-structured fields etc..
<br>
<br>
Classical physics, came face to face with its fundamental error when confronted with the &#147;null results&#148; of the Michelson Morely experiments which were attempting to find a solid ether with the elastic properties of steel.  The failure to detect it revealed that classical physics was critically flawed.  The revolution of &#147;Modern Physics&#148; was begun and we all know that a lack of "understanding" of the quantum level has resulted. This lack of causal understanding has been codified into a set of principles and relations, such as the "wave-particle duality" and Heisenbergs "Uncertainty Relations". 
<br>
<br>
Sorce Theory claims that the revolution was not revolutionary enough.  That it simply patched together the observed &#147;wave-nature&#148; of all matter, with its erroneous tacit assumption of the a-tom in the void, manifested in modern times as the &#147;zero-dimensional point-particle&#148;.  This superficial kludge resulted in the paradox of the &#147;wave-particle duality&#148;.
<br>
<br>
New experiments show, however, that a superfluid can transmit transverse waves, therefore there was no original need to postulate that the ether was a solid in the first place.  This new fact seems to be completely unappreciated in light of the crucial events of history.  Had this been known at the time of the M&amp;M experiments then we would likely have a completely fluid-dynamic ether intact beneath the wave equations of quantum mechanics at this point in time.   Something very akin to Sorce Theory would likely have developed.  As it stands, the equations of modern physics do reveal the fluid-dynamic nature of reality if we but admit what they really represent.  See the first post in this thread for more info on the fluid nature of the core equations of physics.
<br>
<br>
To understand such a complex and radical departure from the &#147;mainstream&#148; one must be prepared to suspend all attachments to the modern interpretations of the observations and equations.  If you are interested in reformatting your interpretive Physics module even for a relatively short period of time, and trying out a completely different Physics operating system, then you are welcomed to send me an email and I will reply with further documentation.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
----------
<br>
<br>
We are in the final stages of preparing to publish a core Sorce Theory book in pdf format on anpheon.org.  I could, perhaps, send you portions of the book, if you really wish to undertake such a radical re-learning process.  The choice is yours, but if you decide not to attempt to learn the theory, if at the very least only to critique it, then you don&#146;t have a leg to stand on when making superficial remarks comparing it to a religion or whatever.  It is vastly more concrete than the Standard model and explains the model in much greater detail at the level of causality beneath the mathematical probabilities and abstractions of &#147;curved-space&#148; and &#147;the wave-nature&#148;.
<br>
<br>
This mission, if you choose to accept it, can be initiated by a simple email to info@anpheon.org.   
<br>

<br>
Here is a quote:
<br>
"But over the past couple of years, a number of mavericks have proposed that black holes are actually extended bodies, made up of an exotic state of matter that congeals, like a liquid turning to ice, during the collapse. The idea offers a provocative way of thinking about quantum gravity, which would unify Einstein's general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics."
<br>
<br>
Interesting...  Sorce Theory is already there.  The superfluid unification and explanation of all the forces has been complete for quite a long time, but it is too radical for the main-stream which must take its own route and it will retain much of its theoretical baggage that gets in the way of understanding.
<br>
<br>
"If one thinks of spacetime as a superfluid, then it is very natural that in fact something physical does happen at the event horizon--that is, the classical event horizon is replaced by a quantum phase transition,"
<br>
<br>
Yes, indeed.  Slowly but surely Physics will come to the same basic conclusion.
<br>
<br>
"For now, these ideas are barely more than scribbles on the back of an envelope, and critics have myriad complaints about their plausibility."
<br>
<br>
It is all worked out already in Sorce Theory.  The trick is how to get the Physicists to abandon all the point-particle baggage so as to accept the correct theory!!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi subtillioN,
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> It is all worked out already in Sorce Theory. The trick is how to get the Physicists to abandon all the point-particle baggage so as to accept the correct theory!! </p></center>
<br>
That trick must be accomplished the old-fashioned way.
<br>
<br>
Using Sorce Theory, posit a "do-able" experiment, using lasers, or accelerators, or cosmological observations of a type not yet done, where Sorce says you will see one thing, and the standard model(s) say you will see something else.
<br>
<br>
Theoretical models of the physical world tend to proceed as two sides of a coin.
<br>
<br>
On one side, the prevalent theory (say, Newtonian Mechanics) explains lots of stuff reasonably well.  But some things are observed in the world that do not fit the model.  What to do?  Revamp the model such that it now explains both the older observations and the newer ones.  Ok, that's one side of the coin.
<br>
<br>
On the other side of that coin, people will examine the implications of the "newer" model, and say, "But that can't be right, because the newer model, by logical extension, says that under these (attainable) conditions, or (performable) observations, you would see THIS ridiculous thing."
<br>
<br>
This presents a challenge to both the proponents of the new model, and the detractors.  Each wants to perfom the suggested experiment, one to demonstrate that you actually WILL see that ridiculous thing, and the other to demonstrate that you will not.
<br>
<br>
In the final analysis, it does not matter a whit whether black holes, or gravitational lenses, or top quarks or quantum-entangled photons really "exist" as a discrete field phenomena or as pressure fluctuations in fluid or anything else.  The point is that the models predicted that Stuff Having Those Apparent Features would be observed, BEFORE they were observed.  And indeed, stuff having those "apparent features" is observed.
<br>
<br>
A new model cannot be content to merely play "catch-up", re-explaining phenomena that are already observed.  It must afford prediction of phenomena not-yet observed, which can be shown to diverge from the prediction of earlier models.
<br>
<br>
And it need not be an ENTIRELY NEW phenomena, either.  Every experiment is done many times over, with slightly different values of energy, force, time, temperature, etc., in order to check that the quantitative measure of the resulting observation agrees with the values predicted by the formulas of the model.
<br>
<br>
Thus, all a "new model" needs to do is demonstrate how its formulas, in such experiments, yould values that would differ, EVEN ONLY SLIGHTLY, from the formulas of the previous model.
<br>
<br>
Challenge the current "physics" community:  "Take a diamond anvil, place 1 microgram of element w within, compress to 5 million pascals, and pulse a laser of frequency f through the material.  You will see that it resonates with amplitude "A", and not with amplitude "B" as the current model would predict."
<br>
<br>
There are trillions of such experiments that can be posited, for which one model will differ from another in prediction.
<br>
<br>
ALL you need to do is provide one.
<br>
<br>
When the uncertainly principle and planck's constant arose, it was not welcome.  It was not desired, even by those who brought it forth.  It was an artifact of their model.  And it was easily derided by many, who said, "That HAS to be wrong, because it suggests that under THESE conditions, you would see THIS effect."  Even though (at that time) no one had the ability to perform the indicated thought experiments, those thought experiments seemed to cast doubt upon the plausibility of the new model.
<br>
<br>
Yet years later, when we arrive at the capability to perform those experiments ... we SEE exactly those effcts that were predicted.  It DOES NOT MATTER whether the EXPLANATION is agreeable or not.  What DOES matter is that we SEE STUFF that looks like what the model predicted.
<br>
<br>
Provide a prediction that differs from the current model, something either do-able today, or "soon enough" that it will interest people in the challenge.
<br>
<br>
Call that prediction the "Sorce Hypothesis", or the "Sorce Effect", or whatever.  Make it a quantitative challenge that contradicts the standard model(s).
<br>
<br>
It must be a do-able experiment.  It must be one that specifies initial conditions like x grams, y velocity, z distance, blah blah, and claims that the standard model yields "V" joules, while the Sorce model yields "W" joules, or some other measurable difference.
<br>
<br>
That is all you need to do.  :)
<br>
<br>
Cheers!  PsyTek</p></td>

<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Imho ... Sorce still speaks about a field. </p></center>
<br>
Your opinion is incorrect.  Sorce speaks of a fluid-dynamic substance which can be quantitatively analyzed and described using fields.  
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> What's a field? It's another word for 'magic'. </p></center>
<br>
Exactly, so any theory that uses space and dimension without taking into account the physical substance for which these things are abstractions--cannot be complete.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  It saying:' Something happens put I can not tell how it works'.  </p></center>
<br>
Sorce Theory is not a theory about fields. Sorce Theory describes the fluid-dynamic causal mechanism involved in ALL the forces and basic physical phenomenon in the universe (Physics).  It gives the mechanisms behind all fields. 
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Of course I don't deny the effect, the measuring ... but there is not mechanical picture.
<br>
 The btw very nice Sorce website (did you designed it?) - shows a an impressive flash/java presentation, but it show the effects, not the engineering picture. What provokes the boundaries? etc.  </p></center>
<br>
The website does not get into the theory yet.  Soon there will be animations etc modeling the formation of atoms from this fluid-dynamic substance. You are welcomed to read the book which gives the mechanisms.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes your website looks quite interesting, but it asserts the physical reality of dimensions and other hypotheticals which Sorce Theory has no need for.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your questions

What does that have to do with enjoying the works of his writing? Dr. Kaku&#146;s ability to present the most complex and exciting concepts of our time is amazing. For one, Dr. Kaku is the co-founder of String FIELD theory, and has given those who are working towards a theory of everything, a basis on which to stand.

My point has nothing to do with "entertainment" unless you, like me, appreciate and enjoy getting closer and closer to Truth, whatever that may be.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> The Ancient Greeks had the steam engine DAMN IT!
<br>
It was invented by Heron of Alexandria and he called it an "aeolopile".
<br>
<br>
  The famed historian Arnold Toynbee says that if the tyrant, Alexander the Great hadn't died at the age of 35, there might well have been a railroad across Ancient China. (See: "Ancient Inventions" by Peter James and Nick Thorpe)
<br>
<br>
   The Industrial Revolution (of THIS unviverse?) happened because of the POTATO PLANT cultivated by the Aymara Indians in present-day Peru. The potato was introduced to Europe (which had DRAFT ANIMALS) and was a HUGE improvement over wheat. Somebody decided to convert the grain-grinding mills into textile mills and within a mere 300 years, Germany went from  ancient subsistence farming to nuclear reactors. (See: "Indian Givers" by Jack Weatherford)
<br>
<br>
    Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday had NOTHING(!!) to do with the Industrial Revolution!
<br>
The Ancient Greeks had Archimedes but NO Industrial Revolution. The engineers and hard-scrabble businesspeople who wired the Western 
<br>
world never even HEARD of Michael Faraday! ("Project Physics" textbook from Princeton).
<br>
<br>
   Kaku talked to 120 world-class experts for his book "Visions" and stated unequivocally that invisibility will NEVER be possible.
<br>
   Well, in March of 2002, the newspapers reported about MIT's $45 million(?) grant to use nanotech and "phased array optics" to build an Invisibility Suit for the WAR MONGERS in the Pentagon.
<br>
<br>
    HERE'S A THOUGHT: The Aymara Indians created the Industrial Revolution. Now they are reduced to existing like junk-yard dogs. Maybe the Masters of the Universe could use their stolen riches to improve humanity as Freeman Dyson says.
<br>
    If not, then civilization is in for a real short ride. </p></td>

Kaku talked to 120 world-class experts for his book "Visions" and stated unequivocally that invisibility will NEVER be possible. 
<br>
Well, in March of 2002, the newspapers reported about MIT's $45 million(?) grant to use nanotech and "phased array optics" to build an Invisibility Suit for the WAR MONGERS in the Pentagon.  </p></center>
<br>
I think you need to reread "Visions". As stated in the book:
<br>
<br>
"At present, we do not know how to manipulate the atomic shell structure of atoms to change their optical properties at will and make objects invisible" p294 of Visions, by Michio Kaku
<br>
<br>
Using nanotechnology to project an image from behind an object, in front of the object as to achieve "invisibility" is our best bet, and is just a trickery of optics and technology.
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>A New and Simple Theory of Everything
<br>
<br>
Whether by the "Mighty Wind" of Moses or the "Big Bang" of Georges Lemaitre's super atom, the universe was created as a great fluid sea of energy. The energy is quantum, packet or particle in form. We title the particles the "Least Particles" because they are the true indivisible atom. Everything and every function of everything is related to the Least Particles.
<br>
<br>
The Least Particles are governed by ten simple rules:
<br>
1. Least Particles are distinct.
<br>
2. Least Particles are exclusive.
<br>
3. Least Particles are eternal.
<br>
4. Least Particles vibrate.
<br>
5. Least Particles are auto kinetic.
<br>
6. Least Particles are attracted by vibrations.
<br>
7. Least Particles are repelled by discordant vibrations.
<br>
8. Least Particles will bond with harmonious Least Particles.
<br>
9. Least Particles receive and transmit signals.
<br>
10.Least Particles are tractable.
<br>
<br>
These are the laws of nature. Stephen Hawking termed the laws of nature the "Mind of God".
<br>
<br>
The "first movement" occured at the moment of creation when Least Particles began to sort themselves out by attraction to harmoniously vibating particles and fleeing disharmoniously vibrating particles. The attraction of Least Particles by vibrations is the "force of gravity". The force of gravity is an accumulative force. When harmoniously vibrating Least Particles move together they form patterns. When two vibrating Least Particles vibrating at the same pitch come together they will bond strongly. This is the "strong force".
<br>
<br>
The assembly into patterns and bonding together of the Least Particles is the "quantum mechanical process". Two Least Particles bond to form a quark. Quarks of the same pitch will bond to form the hadrons. The hadrons form the baryons. The baryons form the nuclei. Other Least Particles attracted to the composition bundle to form the leptons. The leptons do not feel the strong force. The electrons are leptons that are created as echoes by the sounding of the protons and the neutrons in the nuclei. The electrons flow from atom to atom to form electric current.
<br>
<br>
The "quantum mechanical"  process is produced by Least Particles vibrating as notes of two three-note chords of the same pitch.  Hypothetically, it may be said that the bottom quark is formed by the bonding the two botton notes of the chords. The top quark would be formed by the two top notes of the two chords. The up-quark may be formed of the bottom note of one chord blending with the top note of the other chord. The down-quark may be formed of the middle note of one chord and the bottom note of the other. The strange-quark would be formed of the top note of one chord and the middle note of the other. The charm-quark would then be formed of the two middle notes of the two chords.
<br>
<br>
The atoms are created by the assembling of Least Particles into subparticles and the subparticles finally forming the compleate atom. Sometimes, particularly when atoms are composed of many parts, some individual Least Particles will find the overall resonance of the atom discordant to their own vibration and they will 'tunnel out'and escape. This is termed the "weak force" or atomic decay.
<br>
<br>
The Least Particles are "point" particles. However, they do have virtual mass because of their property of exclusion and requirement of  space in which to do their dance.
<br>
<br>
The exclusive property of the Least Particles, the force of exclusion, provides the cosmological constant which Albert Einstein was unable to realize. The force of exclusion is, also, an accumulative force. The force of exclusion keeps the cosmic structures separated. The force of gravity and the force of exclusion shape and bind the finite universe.
<br>
<br>
The "electromagetic force" is generated by the ability of Least Particles to receive and transmit signals of various frequencies and to become regimented because of their tractability.
<br>
When particles and atoms are forced into alignment by magnetism the surrounding Least Particles will be regimented into lines of force. These lines of force are capable of polarizing light, which fact may bring into question the distances and motions of various cosmic structures. The electromagnetic spectrum is pictured as functions occuring at ascending frequencies of vibrations and descending wavelengths. Direct current being at the bottom of the scale and gamma rays at the top. The electromagnetic waves proceed through the universe as transverse waves. "Wave-particle duality" is realized as the receipt and transmission of the vibration signal is passed from Least Particle to Least Particle through the fluid sea of Least Particles. Actual particles may be cloned or duplicated where the wave passes through some Least Particles of the same pitch as the particle originating the signal. That is the reason we find occasional solitary leptons apprearing and disappearing, seemingly at random.
<br>
<br>
The great bulk of the Least Particles that form the universe remain fixed, vibrating at the pitch at which they were created. They do vibrate at a rate sufficient to produce a background temperature of 2.73 kelvin throughout the universe. These Least Particles form the Cold Dark Matter (CDM). Those relatively few Least Particles that are stimulated to move toward areas of excitement increase in vibration frequency and are termed Warm Dark Matter (WDM). The great clouds of dust in which stars, planets and galaxies are formed of WDM. When Least Particles in these areas approach other harmoniously vibrating Least Particles they become excited to higher pitch and bond and assemble to form the atomic structures and are known as Hot Dark Matter (HDM). HDM streaming toward points of attaction form the vortices which become the cosmic structures, and circling inward provide the curvature of space. The effects of drag or speeding up at the edges of galaxies are visible indications of the presence of HDM. The circling HDM refracts the light from behind the galaxies and produces the lensing effects in the manner that atmosphere of the earth produces mirages.
<br>
<br>
The formation of an almost unlimited diversity   of physical structures, each with a purpose, generated by the Least Particles vibrating in pitch from a small section of the scale with their ten simple governing rules is difficult to comprehend. Yet, even more so is the varied structure of biological beings with the red blood system. The bodies of which composed of a large percent water are able to stand erect and move about. They are filled with self-replicating cells guided in development by perfect laser driven computers programmed for exactness and enduring unchanged for 700,000 years.
<br>
<br>
Everything is indicative of purpose. The fetus in the total darkness of the womb developes eyes so that it can see when brought to light.
<br>
<br>
Everything is known throughout the universe. Events from all over the world are received and recorded and affect the reasoning and emotions. Everything affects every other thing. The human mind contains billions of neurons and each neuron has as many as ten thousand dendrils   and many axons to receive and transmit messages. The brain has many many patterns for the use of cogitation and memory. The mind is able to shift the overlaying interlacing patterns of memory and cogitation around to achieve ideas without number. It works in the manner of placing two balls of pith on threads hanging from a bar. When spread apart they hang straight down. When moved close together they attempt to move apart and hang at an angle. So too, in the mind, one  pattern  shifting  over another will cause the changing of synapses and alter thoughts generated in those patterns.
<br>
<br>
It is hard to imagine the creation of an implanted alternative intelligence machine that could compete with the almost unlimited capacity of the human brain with its ablity to shift and interplay a such a huge number of thought and memory patterns available. When one thinks of the odds against winning the Powerball Lottery
<br>
with the millions of combinations available 
<br>
by arranging a row of five numbers chosen from a block of fifty numbers with the addition of one of fifty numbers for the Powerball its hard to believe.
<br>
<br>
Then again it is hard for the individual to remember everything because his system is mostly occupied with staying alive. Articfical intelligence is not necessarily to be implanted into each individual human. There is an effort now to file all knowledge in central locations and make it available by hand held electronic device to everyone in any language anywhere in the world. --Robert Hartsock

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I believe most physicists refer to the "Mind of God" on occasion, particularly so because it is so widely believed He was the author of Creation. The more the physicists were publicized the more statements there were about their mentioning God. A great deal is written about Einstein and his religious beliefs. However, I believe my statement was from Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time".
<br>
<br>
I have a biographhy of Albert Einstein, written by Ronald W. Clark in which it is written, "Einstein's God appears as the physical world itself, with its infinitely marvelous structure, operating at atomic level with the beauty of a craftsman's wristwatch, and at a stellar level with the majesty of a massive cyclotron. This was belief enough. It grew early and rooted deep."

We present different cases of persons who returned from death. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
German scientists collected testimonies of forty cases which passed away for some 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
minutes and then returned. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Universit&#228;t Klinik Bonn, Clinic University of Bonn, Germany, was the institution 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in charge of collecting the forty cases of those persons who assure to have returned of
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
death and who observed life on Earth from the outside. The testimonies were 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
presented by the German newspaper &#147;Bild&#148;.

My trip:

The &#147;Univesal Memory Transciever  Machine&#148; 
<br>
(Time Machine)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#147;Hawkings says that science-fiction inspires the scientists, but sometimes they light 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ideas more strange than those of any writer&#148; ( Short link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080616073350/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/705069)" target="_blank">http://www.lanacion.com.ar/705069)</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My case is the one of a common citizen with a different capacity.  &#147;I saved myself from crazi-
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ness thanks to craziness&#148; which means now there isn&#146;t anything to lose. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It happens that in the year l976, being 24 years old, I fell gravely ill and I was dead. I saw many 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
things in this trip, apart from my own body and my own conscience......I was asked if I wanted to 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
stay or return &#147;because there is still  much you have to do&#148; ...and here I am. There are many 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
similar experiences  which have been described in books, films, Web pages, that is why I am not 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
going to talk  about them .  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course on those days  I did not understand what had happened to me nor did I have 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
antecedents of similar cases. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Later, a great personal transformation took place in me and I began to suffer some &#147;collateral 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
effects&#148; , things  I had never believed . First, the premonitions.......
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Due to the gravity of the events that occurred ,on the fringe of craziness, following my 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
intuition  and on the other hand, my technical studies, I began to repeat the experience of 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#147;passing to the other side to investigate&#148; on my own will , looking for a scientific explanation, 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
because I know it has one. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is not at all easy, especially regarding what entails defeating the fear of going  into such an  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
unknown territory and learning to move in a space in which the earthly laws are no use.......
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have still much to learn, but the spiritual advance was very important. It was worthwhile and 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I consider that what in 1976 was a tragedy , is today a wonderful blessing. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As in every &#147;crisis&#148; that traumatic experience was also an opportunity of &#147;changing my past&#148; and 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I decided not to let it pass. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In that way, coming and going, asking, sometimes crying and in despair, I came to understand 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
many things which I see today as parts of scientific articles.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am surprised at the &#147;coincidences&#148;, but I think I am not mistaken to think that the &#147;universal 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
memory&#148; is present not only in me, but also in all of us, only that sometimes this gravitational
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
attraction of a supposed reality, is strong enough  to capture and maintain us &#147;orbiting&#148;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
not  allowing us to look at ourselves in the mirror illuminated by our own interior light. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I could say , for example, that what we perceive as &#147; reality&#148; is not so, or it is a &#147;hologram&#148;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
product of  the generated energy among other things, by our own thoughts..... it is as if the
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
luminous gravitational force of thought in unending spiral movement , would condense energy
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It were transformed in matter, this at its time evolved and resulted in life and all that we
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 believe to be &#147;real&#148;. That there is no &#147; order without chaos&#148; and vice versa and the particles 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
order and disorder themselves &#147;memorizing&#148; their original space position. ( That&#146;s why you can 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
leave your body , traversing walls to go anywhere and come back without any risk of losing 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
yourself or disintegrating). 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That in the parts there exists the whole and everything is made of the same stuff to a subatomic
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
level. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That on that side there is no space or time, that is why it is possible to &#147;see&#148; the past or the 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
future in &#147;real time&#148;. ( As it were made of infinite parallel films already made with all their 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
possibilities. )
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That the memory is kept out of our physical body , in a kind of hard disk and we only have a 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#147;ram&#148; temporary memory. (Who would rely on temporal beings to keep such precious 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
experiences and knowledge?)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That the vacuum does not exist ( Everything is full of potential energy ) and the speed of transit 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
between one dimension and another one is instantaneous ( Quicker than the speed of light and 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
without the consumption of conventional energy).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That we have a permanent part to which we are connected from various dimensions .....and many
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
things more...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In this moment I study , at an elementary level, or domestic, how to &#147;change some things of the 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
future&#148; which I don&#146;t like .( It seems it works), as all the information is &#147;available&#148; in the 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
universe, one can &#147;look for&#148; the part which interests one, backwards or forwards, as if it were
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
part of a film, and see , use, intervene, decide, edit it.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now there is a documentary film which is called &#147;What the &#147;Bleep&#148; do we know?&#148;.....I haven&#146;t 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
seen it yet, but they tell me it is very impressive......it is causing commotion because it already  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
presents the new paradigms. It DOES NOT talk about going out of your body nor about astral 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
trips....but it DOES talk of the way reality is made up and how we can be in various dimensions at 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the same time, with explanations given by scientists. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The reader may wonder why I am writing such an article......I do it for several reasons, but to 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
begin with, it is enough to mention three of them: 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I)                   Because I consider that you can make a &#147;machine that can catch the universal 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
memory &#148;and why not also &#147; transmit&#148;....may be someone is already making it. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It so happens that since my first experience, beginning the process of transit to the
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
other side ( the real one, where it is perceived that one has a total vision and
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
possibility of an infinite wisdom, with total lucidity and freedom) I feel that in my
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
head ( not in my ears) a very sharp and intense sound, that overcomes all my body and
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
which never completely disappears....I have it for ever.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#147;That sound only increases or diminishes its intensity depending on the degree of 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
communication I have in each moment.&#148; ....that is to say that when I am receiving
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
information of some kind, or I am about to &#147;get out of my body&#148;, the &#147;volume&#148; of 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the sound increases until it reaches an unbearable level......in the long run I have 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
got used to it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, &#147;having asked for detailed information about it&#148; to my superior conscience or to
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
what the people may like to call it, I have heard that that sound seems to be &#147;parted&#148;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in at least five sequential ,consecutive tones, that appear to be only one. As you may 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
notice, I not only receive but also &#147;transmit&#148;.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If the transmission received could be caught by a &#147;receptive aerial&#148; to be &#147;processed by 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a computer&#148;, we would be facing the appearance of a time machine of a virtual
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                 and multidimensional type. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                 In fact, in my lucid astral trips, I travel to other dimensions in which I see other beings, 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                some looking like us, others different.....in what seems to be our planet or may be 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
              another one, in underground installations or not and developing diverse activities
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
              ......fortunately until today, everything is very peaceful....excepting , for some unknown
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
              reason, our own dimension, in which the most unpleasant things in the universe seem to 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
              happen....the most intense experiences. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        2)     In particular, I want to show that if manage to decipher the information 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
              I  sometimes receive about future events correctly. ( Sometimes it is very clear 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
             and others not so much) many human lives could be saved, and many lives would only
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
need &#147;to change some small detail which would modify the future&#148;, what is not
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a small thing to say.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I do not feel any degree of responsibility for the events I foresee, as it could happen in
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1976, because the very investigation demonstrated that it is not I who provokes those
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
grave events; but that does not prevent my human behaviour in front of them....
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
whether it  were  some family problem or certain events that move the whole 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
humanity...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The questioning I receive to this , from the religious point of view ( I am not a member 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
of any religion, but I respect all of them) , is that we should not or can not intervene
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in changing the future ( and why not the past?) . I consider that we provoke it 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
most of the time unconsciously (making use of the supposed &#147;free will&#148; which we were 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
given) and I would like to use it employing a scientific method. This is not penalized 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
by &#147;God&#148; ( Mentioned only in this way, without clearing the concept , so that nobody
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
feels hurt) and we must lose the fear that was imposed upon us to handle us like a 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#147;pack of sheep&#148;.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
                    I am a lover of LIGHT. I would like to be able to leave the cave and destroy the myth 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
of all the hidden things that there are around these topics, with manifest ends of not,  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
but unluckily I do not have the necessary economic means as to finance such a project 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
which would require an interdisciplinary team.

the rules of science are that any experiments HAVE to be repeatable.
<br>
<br>
the aim is to reduce human error in all of us.
<br>
<br>
There are other rules of course.

i dont doubt hat many people have  near death expereineces some of which are similar.

<br>
Realistic  thinker  not  the  speculative  thinker  and  which  is  good  and  sensible..
<br>
<br>
He mentioned  aboiut  Type 0,1,2,3  civilizations out  there  in space..
<br>
<br>
Looking  at  this  notion I  thouht  then  there  should  be  infinite  universes  and  multiverses  down  there  in the  microscopic  universe and  may be   we  are  just  the  products  or  the observing  machines  of  them?  
<br>
<br>
The  reason why  SETI is  no  finding  a  shit  must  be  just  because  we  may  be  too  small  or  too  bog  to  be  able  to observe  their  existence  and  clearly  they  are  also  unaware  of  our  existence..
<br>
<br>
What's  more  we  so  far  our  radio  waves  just  left our  solar  system and  even  didn't  reach  the  nearest  star..  so  logically there should  be  nothing  we  can  expect..  coz we  know  that there  are 400 billion solar  systems with  their starts in the  middlein ONE  GALAXY  and 100 billion Galaxies in our  observable 46  billion light  years  diameter  which  are  dangerously unreachable not  only  to  our  instruments but  also  to  our  imagionation..
<br>
 and  there could  be  universes -- multiverses out  there  on the  horizon where  we  could  one  day  visit  and  ask about  the meaning  of  existnece from the  Type  1000000000000   civilizations..  :-)

I think all you under-grads should experiment with your minds.....in whatever means you're comfortable with. (sleep deprivation, drugs, meditation, fasting, etc...)
<br>
<br>
If you don't stir the solution, well, you know.
<br>
<br>
I think this is an interesting interview, and I think Michio Kaku
<br>
made some compelling points.
<br>
<br>
In all truth, none of us mortals will see the true "reality" of being. Physical reality will never be fully defined.
<br>
<br>
Life itself is unexplainable, mind even more so. Understanding the Cosmos even more daunting. Use all the numbers you want...explain your reality. I think the Multiverse idea makes the most sense. None of you nerds can proove otherwise
<br>
<br>
I also like the use of !!!! to make a point in a scientific debate. And the lack of spell check rules too.

good luck with those #'s

COSMIC FUNCTION OF THE UNIVERSE 
<br>
(REPRODUCED FROM VEDIC VISION OF THE UNIVERSE BY DR. VIDYARDHI NANDURI -1996) 
<br>
DEFNITION 
<br>
An undefined Universe lands in confusion and utter chaos. 
<br>
This confusion leads to imagination eg. Fire ball. Radiation, Cooling,Gravity, Inflation,10^12 degrees in a shade, frozen states and even run away prophecies. 
<br>
Philosophers also need to specify where and how science can advance. 
<br>
Here is an exercise to define the Cosmic function of the Universe (by Dr. 
<br>
VIDYARDHI NANDURI) with 50 principles that may form a link to the 28 flows of 
<br>
the 7 dimensional Cosmic Universe. 
<br>
This Cosmic function identified through the Hindu Philosophy should help 
<br>
complete comprehension. 
<br>
(Note :The subject is covered in Three-stages STAGE I (1 to 16), STAGE II 
<br>
(17 to 30), STAGE III(31 to 50). 
<br>
<br>
S T A G E &#150; I 
<br>
<br>
The Universe operates through orderliness, but not chaos. (Dharma) 
<br>
The Universe operates under a Process (Yajna). 
<br>
The Universe operates through Divine Cosmic flow shining Principle. (Param 
<br>
Jyoti) 
<br>
The Universe is regulated by Cosmic Fields. 
<br>
The Cosmic flow and the Cosmic Fields operate together in alignment under Cosmic 
<br>
Source. 
<br>
The Cosmic Source directs the Fields and flows. 
<br>
The Cosmic Universe is Self - contained. 
<br>
It is out of this Cosmic Self - Contained Energy Universe emerges a self- contained known Universe as Part and Parcel. 
<br>
The observations are limited to one fourth part of the Cosmic Universe. 
<br>
The Divine Principles and a Human Being in depth need to operate under aligned 
<br>
Cosmic Flows. 
<br>
A Human Being in depth is a micro - cosmic manifestation of the Macro 
<br>
- Cosmic Universe directed by divine conscious SOUL. 
<br>
A Human Being on Earth in Solar System is part of Galactic Home : Extend the vision beyond. 
<br>
Extend the vision inwards

COSMOLOGY STRUCTURES-NEW MODELLING 
<br>
Vidyardhi Nanduri 
<br>
Cosmology Research Center, Vikaspuri, Hyderabad 500038, India. 
<br>
Abstract. 
<br>
The Cosmology research is aimed to locate or arrive at the drive junction 
<br>
points for the following (1) Solar-planetary search around 100 AU beyond Sun to 
<br>
locate regions with 1000 times the intensity of the Sun, (2) Milky-way Galaxy 
<br>
search around 103 parsec with index through any spherical disk Galactic region, 
<br>
(3) Inter-Galactic region search for groups of 12 or multiples with neutral 
<br>
flows as index and (4) Cosmic flow stable regions. This paper describes new 
<br>
approaches in Cosmology Modeling that helps to interpret HST and Explorer data 
<br>
with a new vision. The basis of this approach is outlined through several 
<br>
research reports earlier by the author

<br>
<br>
<br>
What I miss is SYMMETRY.
<br>
<br>
If we see only one third of the Cosmos, but we are able to view the so called MICROWAVE BACKGROUND RADIATION , then it seems to be a logical step to assume that outside this Microwave Background there could be an other Universe, in symmetry terms probably a symmetric one with ours coupled by long range entanglement?.
<br>
If the anti-copy humans living there are for 50% our observers, and we are for the other half of all out decisions ( events), the observers of them, then you could be perfectly right about the regulation by cosmic fields WHICH WE COULD CALL: ENTANGLEMENT ON COSMIC SCALE BETWEEN COPY UNIVERSES.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I found "the the goal is to find an equation, perhaps no more than one inch long" and put it on a t-shirt, a button, and a lunch box (the first two for sale).  It is:
<br>
<br>
Jq - Jm = Box^2 A
<br>
<br>
where Jq is the electric current density, Jm is the mass current density in the same units, Box^2 is two covariant derivatives applied to a 4-potential.  This is a butt load of math behind this claim, something like a 5 hour monologue of partial differential equations, or a 30 page Mathematica notebook.
<br>
<br>
Here's the big picture - no math - view. 
<br>
<br>
The Universe, being you-cannot-comprehend-it old at 13.6 billion years has to do nothing to last that long.  To a darn good approximation, nothing does happen in the Universe.  The problem is that there is other stuff in the Universe.  So the word problem translates to this: "What math should one use to do in spacetime that is the closest thing to doing nothing?".  There is an answer, it is called a slinky (for those into jargon, a 4D simple harmonic oscillator).  It is accepted by the physics community that the transverse wiggle is about light.  Right now, I am bowling alone with the idea that the other wiggles (time-like and longitudinal) do the work of gravity.  I think all the pins are going to go down: no need for ten or eleven dimensions, a new stable constant velocity solution eliminates the need for dark matter, inertial mass breaks gauge symmetry of the standard model so no Higgs is needed, the vacuum equations are linear so Einstein's field equations - useful all this time - are not right and any work on black holes is wrong.  That is about as obnoxious as it gets, oh well, the Universe will get along fine, doing almost nothing.</p></td>

All the details are spelled out in technical books like Landau and Lifshitz "Classical Fields".  It sounds like you will not be able to read such a work.  This is not a put down, just an observation.  We may all be able to leaf through a Beethoven sonata, but few can actually play it.  A big picture can be provided.  A Lagrange density is a way to describe every way that a system can trade energy inside a bread box.  Looking at how different kinds of change happen in a Lagrange density reveals things like forces and field equations.
<br>
<br>
We have a Lagrange density for light that totally rocks.  We have a Lagrange density for gravity that is super simple.  These two Lagrangians do not play together.  That is the deepest problem in theoretical physics.  People who work with strings like Michael K have a Lagrange density that works in a space of eleven dimension.  It is my technical opinion that none of that work will last the test of time because spacetime is 4D.  I have an alternative that can be tested experimentally.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think we are all ignoring a subtle issue of the basis of our reality. We all assume that all the information of our existence is readily available or will be available through some kind of scientific break through. We believe that the universe will confess her secrets to us. That is not necessarily true. For instance the metamorphosis of matter from rest mass to energy, e.g. a photon transforming into an electron and positron, there's no explanation of how that happens. We can't make any measurements or detect any information as to how nature performs this trick. All we know is that it happens, we can see the result of it happening but we can't perceive the mechanics of how it happens. There is no law of nature that mandates that all information is made available to us mere humans! 
<br>
<br>
On another note we all believe that our reality is composed of particles spread out over a vast volume. Could there be another perspective? What if the physical universe were nothing more than a small configuration that can contain energy in ever-complex forms where processes could produce a virtual reality? If we look at the phenomena of quantum vacuum energy were particles just appear out of nowhere the idea of our existence being virtual makes sense. It makes sense because particles appearing out of nowhere is exactly what a virtual reality could do!
<br>
<br>
In the end however we never get the complete picture. We are not privy to all the secrets of nature. No matter how advance a civilization can become the ultimate truth is forever hidden...
