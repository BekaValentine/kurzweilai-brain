<div class="TeaserText">Space Wars by Willliam Scott, Michael Coumatos, and William Birnes, Forge Books (April 17, 2007) describes how the first hours of World War III might play out in the year 2010. While fiction, it's based on real-world military scenarios and technologies, dramatically highlighting the West's vulnerability to destruction of its space-based commercial and military communications infrastructure.</div>

<br>
<i>What makes </i>Space Wars<i> especially credible&#8212;and a fascinating 
              and informative read&#8212;is the outstanding technical and military 
              expertise of two of the authors. Michael Coumatos is a former U.S.

<p><i>- Amara D. Angelica, Editor, KurzweilAI.net</i><br>
</p>
<p><i><b>How close are the scenarios and wargaming descriptions in 
              </b></i><b>Space Wars</b><i><b> to the real world? </b></i></p>
<p>In my opinion, the <i>Space Wars</i> scenarios are very realistic, 
              based on my years of reporting on military space issues. The vulnerability 
              of U.S. satellites&#8212;commercial, civil and military&#8212;has 
              concerned milspace professionals and leaders for many years. As 
              one Cincspace told me almost 10 years ago (paraphrased), "I 
              have nightmares about getting that call from the president, saying: 
              'What's killing our satellites, who or what's responsible and what 
              are you doing about it?' I sure don't want my answer to be: 'I don't 
              know, I don't know and I don't know.'" In other words, that 
              four-<a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> Cincspace (we no longer have a "Commander-in-chief" 
              of space, so that term's out of date) and his U.S. "space warriors" 
              are in dire need of national policies, doctrines, realistic strategies 
              and tactics, and more tools to deal with myriad threats to our space 
              infrastructure.</p>
<p>Still, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> IS being made. Sensors that will help engineers 
              and space operators quickly determine whether an anomaly is caused 
              by cosmic rays or somebody lasing or jamming a satellite ARE being 
              built into new national security spacecraft. However, those sensors 
              are still not being installed routinely on <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> satellites&#8212;even 
              though the Defense Dept. relies heavily on commercial comsats and 
              imaging sats.</p>
<p>The wargaming scenarios&#8212;as well as some of the "real-world" 
              scenarios&#8212;in <i>Space Wars</i> are amalgamations of outcomes 
              and insights gained from actual wargames, such as those listed on 
              pg. 7 of the book's forward.</p>
<p>Finally, weapons and systems depicted in SW are real or based on 
              real-world technologies, although some remain classified. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, 
              as an <i>AvWeek</i> reporter, I confirmed years ago that classified 
              tests done at China Lake NAS, Calif., proved that a maser could 
              be accurately controlled and targeted by first firing a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a>, then 
              firing the maser a split second later. The latter's microwave beam 
              would follow the laser-formed "waveguide" through the 
              air, enabling the beam to be aimed accurately and controlled. </p>
<p>Has such a weapon been developed and deployed? I don't know. Would 
              it also work in space, or would the maser beam start wandering like 
              wet spaghetti, once it left the atmosphere? I don't know that, either. 
              Some scientists believe the beam would remain coherent and stable 
              in space, but I was never able to confirm that tests had demonstrated 
              that ability. Inside the atmosphere, though, actual testing DID 
              confirm that the laser-maser combination enabled accurately targeting 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s with high-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> microwave beams.</p>
<p>Ref. the Blackstar system: I now have several photos of the XOV 
              spaceplane sitting on a Lockheed Martin flightline ramp, so the 
              vehicle definitely exists. Based on 15+ years of sighting reports, 
              inside sources, etc., I determined that Blackstar's SR-3 carrier 
              aircraft and several versions of the XOV were built and flown. An 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162159/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/030606p1.xml" target="_blank">AvWeek 
              cover story</a> describing the system ran in the March 6, 2006, 
              issue. </p>

<i>Blackstar spaceplane? (Aviation Week)</i></p>
<p>Despite considerable feedback that spanned the spectrum from attaboy 
              support to flaming criticism, the stories DID prompt airtight confirmation 
              to come back to me from impeccable sources. Bottom line: some may 
              dispute it, but the Blackstar system exists and has flown. Whether 
              it can achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a> and was/is used exactly as we've depicted via 
              "Speed's" flights in Space Wars is strictly an educated 
              guess, based on my <i>AvWeek</i> reporting.</p>
<p><b><i>What are your <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s on the recent Chinese destruction 
              of their satellite, and the possibility that it was an ASAT test?</i></b></p>
<p>It was definitely considered to be an ASAT test, according to several 
              general officers who spoke at last week's Space Symposium here in 
              Colo. Springs. I think such an ASAT threat has existed for some 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and our milspace professionals knew it was just a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of 
              time until some <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> demonstrated it. The Russians already HAD 
              demo'd the capability decades ago, and Doug Pearson really DID shoot 
              down a satellite in 1985, firing a missile from his F-15. As the 
              USAF commander of Space Command said last week, the Chinese ASAT 
              test was a major wakeup call for all spacefaring nations, proving 
              once and for all that "space is no longer a sanctuary."</p>
<p><b><i>How does Russia's planned Glonass system relate to the European 
              nav sat system described in the book?</i></b></p>
<p>Both are considered alternatives to the U.S. GPS <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. Ultimately, 
              Russia, Europe and the U.S. envision some commercial receivers will 
              be able to use any of these signals for precise navigation and timing. 
              Glonass and <a class="thought" href="entries/galileo_entry.html">Galileo</a> are being developed to (ostensibly) ensure satellite-based 
              nav and timing will always be available, because the U.S. system 
              could be turned off at will. The U.S. military controls GPS, and 
              the Pentagon could disable certain or all GPS signals during a national 
              emergency &#8212; writ "war." </p>
<p>Yet, GPS signals are becoming virtual global utilities, depended 
              upon by millions of users. The Euros, Russians, Japan and others 
              see billions of dollars to be made by selling receivers and GPS-embedded 
              products, as well, and want to get in on that commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. 
              Bottom line, though, is this: they're alternatives to GPS, sold 
              to financiers as "guaranteed service" options, should 
              the U.S. turn off GPS.</p>
<p><b><i>Are there any other recent technical, military, political, 
              and other developments that tie in with the book or that were predicted 
              in the book?</i></b></p>
<p>The Iranian political situation today is playing out largely as 
              we anticipated. Technologies for "operationally responsive 
              space" &#8212; smallsats and quick-response launchers &#8212; 
              are evolving quickly. Autnomous on-orbit servicing of satellites 
              is being demonstrated now by the Orbital Express spacecraft, a feature 
              that plays more dramatically in our sequel, Space Wars II (now being 
              written by the same coauthors). The Chinese ASAT test has awakened 
              Congress and American citizens to the potential threats facing our 
              space infrastructure, but I don't think our political leaders fully 
              appreciate what impacts those threats could have on the U.S. national 
              security posture and citizens' activities.</p>
<p><b><i>What kind of comments are you getting from savvy early readers 
              so far?</i></b></p>
<p>Initial feedback we're getting is that <i>Space Wars</i>' message 
              is "bang-on," prophetic, scary and very timely. Many readers 
              either had no idea the U.S.&#8212;and modern <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>, in general&#8212;was 
              so dependent on "space," or that losing satellites might 
              have such dramatic impacts in the geopolitical realm, as well on 
              people's daily lives. Perhaps the most succinct feedback I've heard 
              was: "This is a very possible, very scary <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. I hope it 
              doesn't come true." Although many of our readers, who have 
              a military background, are aware of the threats we depict, they 
              hadn't put the IMPACTS of attacks on satellites and the ISS into 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> the way Space Wars does&#8212;or so they're telling us.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, during the annual Space Symposium (attended by approx. 
              7,000 space professionals from across the globe), many senior military, 
              commercial and civil leaders bought copies of Space Wars and had 
              Mike and me sign their books. Interestingly, the first two copies 
              were purchased by a two-star USAF general, who is the chancellor 
              of the National Security Space Institute, and her aide. She also 
              wants to talk to us about some "hot-button" issues we 
              should consider for our second <i>Space Wars </i>book.</p>

Space wars with their interplanetary battles are as near to reality as the most stupid fairy tales. Any scenarios of space war cannot go outside the laws of nature. This does not follow, that we do know the laws. 
<br>
<br>
From thousands of fictions where was mentioned the future are some coincidences. Most of them are such as in &#8220;The First 48 Hour of the War with the Fascist Germany&#8221; (see OKTYABR&#8217; for 1939). How it was in reality is well known. It seems, that the epics of &#8216;Space Wars&#8217; are more distant from reality. To say nothing about political senselessness there is broke of nature&#8217;s laws.  
<br>

The catastrophic destructiveness of the coming war with its tremendous losses is possible to escape. The USA should not force democracy to societies with a jungle level of understanding of what democracy is. The USA should not defend their ill-wishers, e.g. in Europe. Tremendous money spent for this (many hundreds of billions), and money which would came after balancing the trade, would allow in some short time to become not an importer, but an exporter of fuel. It would allow the creation of a near absolute defense from missiles and other means that are dangerous for the USA.
<br>
<br>
E.g. in Iran or Korea must be destroyed everything that is dangerous for the USA. Iranian missiles with A-bombs, which can reach Moscow or Paris, should be indifferent to the USA. If something there is dangerous to the USA, it must be completely destroyed. It should be announced as official politics. Then Europe instead of flirting with terrorists would implore the USA to include them into its defense system. In addition, they would give all the necessary money.
<br>
<br>
Russia does not learn. When the great Reagan told Gorbachev &#8220;You would not win this arm race&#8221;, he had in mind do not compete with SDI if you do not want to lose your country. He knew what he said. Now Russia once more started a competition in arm race. This is done in the presence of a mighty China. The result is definite.
<br>
<br>
The USA can allow some reasonable egoism. The USA is the only really self-sufficient country. Its temporary and partial isolation would not greatly influence its life. However, the rest of the world could not bear it.

Given that several private companies are almost at that threshold, how hard could it be for a rogue state or sub-state to get there?

Sure LEO would be denied for everybody, but if you would rather live in the dark ages, what do you need with LEO anyway?

Putting 2.5 tons of ball bearings in a retro-grade orbit would be effective, but it would kill everything in that orbit, not just specific targets.    It would have the effect of levelling the playing field, rather than giving advantage to one group or the other.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'm not an expert, but I think that the odds of that being disastrous are pretty low.  This is all purely guesswork, but:
<br>
<br>
I don't think a significant percentage of the bearings would find themselves in a semi-stable orbit that would last more than a few hours, being projected in all directions by the explosive blast.  Most of them would be drawn earthward and burn up in the atmostphere fairly quickly.
<br>
<br>
Even given a very high (in my opinion) amount of 5% staying in LEO, the odds of impacting something are still very small.  If we assume BB size bearings, which I think are easily enough to disable most satellites, you have about 1400 bearings per pound, 7 million total, with 350000 staying in orbit.
<br>
<br>
LEO is an altitude of 200 to 2000 kilometers, with a volume of 1.3 tillion cubic kilometers, or 1.3 x 10^21 cubic meters, with a bearing density of 1 in 3.7 x 10^15 cubic meters.  Guessing that the average satellite has a volume of 1 cubic meter, and with an orbit circumference of 41 million meters, this gives it a 1 in 90 million chance of hitting a bearing per orbit.  With an average LEO speed being 7800 meters/second, 90 million orbits means the average satellite would last for 15000 years up there.  With about 2500 satellites (as of 2006), the bearings would take out one satellite every 6 years.
<br>
<br>
I admit that's a simplistic view and based on a lot of educated guesses, but I don't think it would be a big deal.</p></td>

The bigger the problem they create to bigger the opposing power needed to reverse the problem.  The problem is that there is a huge disconnect between the head and body with countries.  The head (government) and the body (the population) are disconnected like paraplegics.  The head still pumps the heart but does not allow movement of the body.  The head is addicted to nuclear weapons and the body is slowly dieing from the build up and the ultimate mass mutation into nuclear war.  Addiction is powerful and cunning, disguising itself as a friend but deep down you know the head knows it will kill the body in turn killing the head.</p></td>

Dear Sir,
<br>
Now, I understand that perhaps some people will watch whatever god-awful thing is in front of them on a TV screen. And some people might appreciate the diversion of a cheesy movie during a night spent watching television. But some people might want to actually think for themselfs. Perhaps listen to their own reasoning. Or just...be quiet.
<br>
<br>
The thought logic you use are old and out-dated. The facts for your argument are barely visible from some of the seat of proper sanity. I suggest you get rid of them entirely. And unless you can replace them with better arguments and arrange for each point to have a valuable educational point, I, for one, would sincerely appreciate a quiet, relaxing, less ingorant ladden time spent reading on this website.
<br>
<br>
Sincerly

<br>
<br>
????!!!!?
<br>
<br>
With this sort of mindless, nationalist, ignorant, aggressive, childish mentality, America will surely fall, in smoking ruins. A one-part system is inherently screwed. There must be balance and competition for our species to survive. Any attempt by the USA to politically dominate the world will result in the collapse of the system. Dictatorships never work. There will always be revolution, corruption and eventual dissolution. It's the law of nature; undeniable and irresistable.
<br>
<br>
Your mentality is neanderthal and stupid. The only chance for human progression and development is global democracy. Inflicting 'US democracy' on anyone that waves a gyroscope around will have one effect - enhanced global hatred. Bear in mind North Americans are already the least popular race on earth at the moment. watch out for the Chinese. They're taking over. And they don't tolerate fools.
<br>
<br>
2. "The USA is the only really self-sufficient country."
<br>
<br>
???
<br>
<br>
Crap. You're the biggest consumers on the planet. See how you go cutting yourselves off. You'll be screwed in weeks.
<br>
<br>
By the way, where are you from? Your use of English tells me that you must be a migrant.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. "the USA should go full cold war era. Destroy all who stand in the way."
<br>
<br>
"Either you join the American Empire or we nuke you into oblivion."
<br>
<br>
Is there supposed to be some sarcasm in that?
<br>
<br>
If not, see above.
<br>
<br>
By the way, I'm not a Muslim, a radical, a middle-eastern, a lefty, or a godless communist. I'm English, Caucasian, livng in Australia, loving everything that the western world provides, and completely amazed by the crap that comes out of the minds of some Americans (seaboards excepted).
<br>
<br>
Sounds like a good book though...</p></td>

<br>
The whole idea of Capitalism to keep growing.  For anything to continuously grow it needs to be fed.  What feeds capitalism?  The answer is oil.  When I was a kid the new houses were smaller and large house were very few.  Now all the new houses are large and are in temperate climates with cold winters and hot summers which all have  heat and air conditioning.  The people in these houses tend to buy gas guzzling autos also.  This life style (which my country) is trying to spread around the world is going to be all consuming beast that's hunger will eat its creator because the food (oil) will be spread to thin ultimately leading to a nuclear holocaust to procure oil resources.

<br>
The only solution I can see is a worldwide mandatory cap of the amount of natural resource any one person or group can use in any given time period.</p></td>

BBC's killer documentary called 'The Power of Nightmares'. Top CIA officials openly admit, Al-qaeda is a total and complete fabrication, never having existed at any time. The Bush administration needed a reason that complied with the Laws so they could go after 'the bad guy of their choice' namely laws that had been set in place to protect us from mobs and 'criminal organizations' such as the Mafia. They paid Jamal al Fadl, hundreds of thousands of dollars to back the U.S. Government's story of Al-qaeda, a 'group' or criminal organization they could 'legally' go after. This video documentary is off the hook'

As far as I can tell, since all the renowned terrorist groups are or have been funded and organized by various western institutions such as the CIA, MI6 and various private actors, if any terrorists "start world war III" it will only be because traitors in the west gave them the weapons, taught them how to use them and where to aim.
<br>
<br>
A much more likely scenario is that a terrorist attack carried out in such a manner will then immediately be jumped on by transhumanists, geopolitic madmen and corporate Strangeloves of the worst order to launh a highly profitable war.
<br>
<br>
It is also highly likely that such a war would cause the same people to dismantle any semblance of freedom, liberty and justice back home in the process.
<br>
<br>
If you do not believe me then there is ample literature on this and related subjects, much of it written by globalist eugenecists themselves.

Whatever your academic merit and brilliance supporting this web of deceit and using your research to back it is the complete opposite of science, and makes you more related to the Inquisition than the people who inspired you to search for answers in the first place.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>More to the point I find the idea that the US should somehow have a need for "space infrastructure" highly offensive. I come from Europe so maybe I haven`t been properly trained to accept this sort of thing, but every american must see how threatening this is to anyone not yet enslaved, brainwashed or dead everywhere in the world.
<br>
<br>
You wear a rhetoric saying you are the Guardians of Freedom but this claim is not borne out of anything your country has done since WWII and perhaps beyond, considering how little truth actually gets piblished about anything important in our society.
<br>
<br>
The truth is most people want peace, it is in fact traditionally only very very rich people who like wars, since they`ll always be safe anyway. Most people also want to live in their countries without having them plundered, outsourced to regions which practise slave-labor or otherwise dismantled in the name of globalism.
<br>
<br>
Space based weaponry is a highly opressive phenomenon to the entire world, and the mere notion that such a structure could somehow be hijacked from an Afghan cave with a laptop and bring the US at risk is ridiculous. The best thing to do is to disassemble this and other forms of high tech weaponry and leave other people in peace, so that`s what I`ll recommend to Kurzweil and anyone else in positions of power.
<br>
<br>
The alternative is fascism, opression, surveillance, police state, wars and genocide.
<br>
<br>
Science doesn`t have to be about any of these things, but it is because some people have decided it should be. Scientists cooperating in such a drive are traitors to their fellow men, plain and simple.</p></td>
