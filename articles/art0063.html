<br><p>Originally published September 1, 1999 in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614002014/http://www.sciam.com/" target="_new">Scientific American</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>Sometime early in the next century, the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will exceed that of humans. Within several decades, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will exhibit the full range of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intellect, <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s and skills, ranging from musical and other creative aptitudes to physical movement. They will claim to have feelings and, unlike today's virtual personalities, will be very convincing when they tell us so. By 2019 a $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will at least match the processing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. By 2029 the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will have been largely mastered, and the average <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> will be equivalent to 1,000 brains.</p>
<p>Within three decades, the author maintains, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s will be available that <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> directly to our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cells. The implants would enhance sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s and improve our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>Once <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s achieve a level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> comparable to that of humans, they will necessarily soar past it. For example, if I learn French, I can't readily <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to you. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> is that for us, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> involves successions of stunningly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of interconnections among <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cells (<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s) and among the concentrations of biochemicals, known as <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s, that enable impulses to travel from <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. We have no way of quickly <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing these <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. But quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing will allow our <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> creations to share immediately what they learn with billions of other <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Ultimately, <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities will master not only the sum total of their own <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> but all of ours as well.</p>
<p>As this happens, there will no longer be a clear distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. We are already putting <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s--<a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s--directly into people's brains to counteract <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's disease</a> and tremors from multiple sclerosis. We have <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>s that restore hearing. A <a class="thought" href="entries/retinal_implant_entry.html">retinal implant</a> is being developed in the U.S. that is intended to provide at least some visual <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> for some blind <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, basically by replacing certain visual-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Recently scientists from Emory University implanted a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of a paralyzed stroke victim that allows him to use his brainpower to move a cursor across a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen.</p>
<p>In the 2020s <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s will improve our sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. By 2030, instead of just phoning a friend, you will be able to meet in, say, a virtual Mozambican game preserve that will seem compellingly real. You will be able to have any type of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>--business, social, sexual--with anyone, real or simulated, regardless of physical proximity.</p><h1>How <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Evolve</h1><p>To gain insight into the kinds of forecasts I have just made, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to recognize that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is advancing exponentially. An exponential process starts slowly, but eventually its pace increases extremely rapidly. (A fuller documentation of my argument is contained in my new book, The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>.)</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> have both followed the same <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>: they take a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to get going, but advances build on one another and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> erupts at an increasingly furious pace. We are entering that explosive part of the technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> curve right now.</p>
<p>Consider: It took billions of years for <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> to form. It took two billion more for <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to begin and almost as long for <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s to organize into the first multicellular plants and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s about 700 million years ago. The pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> quickened as <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s inherited <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> some 65 million years ago. With the emergence of primates, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> was measured in mere millions of years, leading to <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> perhaps 500,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been a continuation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process that gave rise to us-the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>-in the first place. It took tens of thousands of years for our ancestors to figure out that sharpening both sides of a stone created useful tools. Then, earlier in this millennium, the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> required for a major <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> had shrunk to hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The pace continued to accelerate during the 19th century, during which technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> was equal to that of the 10 centuries that came before it. Advancement in the first two decades of the 20th century matched that of the entire 19th century. Today significant technological transformations take just a few years; for example, the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a>, already a ubiquitous form of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and commerce, did not exist just nine years ago.</p>
<p>Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is experiencing the same <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. Over the past several decades, a key factor in this expansion has been described by <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, a co-founder of Intel, noted in the mid-1960s that technologists had been doubling the density of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s every 12 months. This meant <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were periodically doubling both in <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> and in speed per unit cost. In the mid-1970s Moore revised his observation of the doubling <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to a more accurate estimate of about 24 months, and that trend has persisted through the 1990s.</p>
<p>After decades of devoted service, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> will have run its course around 2019. By that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> features will be just a few atoms in width. But new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s will continue the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing. For example, computing cubes are already being designed that will provide thousands of layers of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, not just one as in today's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips. Other technologies that promise orders-of-magnitude increases in computing density include nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s built from <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms, optical computing, <a class="thought" href="entries/crystalline_comp_entry.html">crystalline computing</a> and molecular computing.</p>
<p>We can readily see the march of computing by plotting the speed (in instructions per second) per $1,000 (in constant dollars) of 49 famous calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s spanning the 20th century [see graph below]. The graph is a study in <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> speed per unit cost doubled every three years between 1910 and 1950 and every two years between 1950 and 1966 and is now doubling every year. It took 90 years to achieve the first $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> capable of executing one million instructions per second (<a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>). Now we add an additional <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> to a $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> every day.</p><h1>Why Returns Accelerate</h1><p>Why do we see exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> occurring in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and computing? It is the result of a fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> of any <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process, a <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> I call the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>. As <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> exponentially increases (which reflects the essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>), the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> events grows shorter. Advancement speeds up. The returns--the valuable products of the process--accelerate at a nonlinear rate. The escalating <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in the price performance of computing is one <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant example of such accelerating returns.</p>
<p>A frequent criticism of predictions is that they rely on an unjustified extrapolation of current trends, without considering the forces that may alter those trends. But an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process accelerates because it builds on past achievements, including improvements in its own means for further <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. The resources it needs to continue <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> are its own increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> in the environment in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process takes place, which provides the options for further <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>. These two resources are essentially without limit.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a> shows that by 2019 a $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> will have the processing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>--20 million billion calculations per second. Neuroscientists came up with this figure by taking an estimation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 100 billion, and multiplying it by 1,000 connections per <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> and 200 calculations per second per connection. By 2055, $1,000 worth of computing will equal the processing power of all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> (of course, I may be off by a year or two).</p>
<p>The accelerating rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in computing is demonstrated by this graph, which shows the amount of computing speed that $1,000 (in constant dollars) would buy, plotted as a function of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> power per unit cost is now doubling every year.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a></h1><p>That's the prediction for processing power, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Of greater <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance is the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>One approach to creating this <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is to painstakingly <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> the rules of complex processes. We are getting good at this task in certain cases; the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">CYC</a> (as in "encyclopedia") <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> designed by Douglas B. Lenat of <a class="thought" href="entries/cycorp_entry.html">Cycorp</a> has more than one million rules that describe the intricacies of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, and it is being applied to <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s so that they return smarter answers to our queries.</p>
<p>Another approach is "<a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_theory_entry.html">complexity theory</a>" (also known as <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">chaos theory</a>) computing, in which self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s gradually learn <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a manner <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. One such <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>, neural nets, is based on simplified mathematical models of <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Another <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>, called genetic (or <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary) <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, is based on allowing intelligent solutions to develop gradually in a simulated process of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, we will learn to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by copying the best intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> we can get our hands on: the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself. We will reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and fortunately for us it's not even <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a>ed!</p>
<p>The most immediate way to reach this goal is by destructive scanning: take a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> frozen just before it was about to expire and examine one very thin slice at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to reveal every <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, interneuronal connection and concentration of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s across each gap between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (these gaps are called <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s). One condemned killer has already allowed his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body to be scanned, and all 15 billion bytes of him can be <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed on the <a class="thought" href="entries/national_library_of_medicine_entry.html">National Library of Medicine</a>'s Web site. The resolution of these scans is not nearly high enough for our purposes, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> at least enable us to start <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about these issues.</p>
<p>We also have noninvasive scanning techniques, including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (<a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>) and others. Their increasing resolution and speed will eventually enable us to resolve the connections between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. The rapid improvement is again a result of the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>, because massive <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is the main <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> in higher-resolution imaging.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to send microscopic robots (or "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s") into the bloodstream and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> them to explore every capillary, monitoring the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s connections and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations.</p><h1>Fantastic Voyage</h1><p>Although sophisticated robots that small are still several decades away at least, their <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> for probing the innermost recesses of our bodies would be far-reaching. They would communicate <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly with one another and report their findings to other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. The result would be a noninvasive scan of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> taken from within.</p>
<p>Most of the technologies required for this scenario already exist, though not in the microscopic size required. Miniaturizing them to the tiny sizes needed, however, would reflect the essence of the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>. For example, the translators on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> have been shrinking by a factor of approximately 5.6 in each <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension every 10 years.</p>
<p>The capabilities of these embedded <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s would not be limited to passive roles such as monitoring. Eventually they could be built to communicate directly with the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s in our brains, enhancing or extending our mental capabilities. We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can communicate with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s by detecting their activity and either triggering nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s to fire or suppressing them from firing. The embedded <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will be capable of reprogramming neural connections to provide virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s and to enhance our <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> and other cognitive faculties.</p>
<p>To decode and understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s (which, incidentally, combine both <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s), it is not necessary to see every connection, because there is a great deal of redundancy within each region. We are already applying insights from early stages of this reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering process. For example, in speech recognition, we have already decoded and copied the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s early stages of sound processing.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting than this scanning-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-to-understand-it approach would be scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> for the purpose of <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing it. We would map the locations, interconnections, and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of all the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations. The entire organization, including the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, would then be re-created on a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>To do this, we would need to understand local <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes, and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is already under way. Theodore W. Berger and his co-workers at the University of Southern California have built <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s that precisely match the processing characteristics of substantial clusters of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Carver A. Mead and his colleagues at the California Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> have built a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s that emulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> characteristics of <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian neural <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s.</p>
<p>Developing complete maps of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not as daunting as it may sound. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a> seemed impractical when it was first proposed. At the rate at which it was possible to scan genetic codes 12 years ago, it would have taken thousands of years to complete the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. But in accordance with the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>, the ability to sequence <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> has been accelerating. The latest estimates are that the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> will be completed in just a few years.</p>
<p>By the third decade of the 21st century, we will be in a position to create complete, detailed maps of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally relevant features of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and to re-create these designs in advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural computer</a>s. We will provide a variety of bodies for our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, too, from virtual bodies in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> to bodies comprising swarms of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s. In fact, <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> robots that ambulate and have lifelike facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s are already being developed at several laboratories in Tokyo.</p><h1>Will It Be Conscious?</h1><p>Such possibilities prompt a host of intriguing issues and questions. Suppose we scan someone's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and reinstate the resulting "<a class="thought" href="entries/mind_file_entry.html">mind file</a>" into a suitable <a class="thought" href="entries/computing_medium_entry.html">computing medium</a>. Will the <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that emerges from such an <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> be conscious? This being would appear to others to have very much the same personality, <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. For some, that is enough to define <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. For others, such as physicist and author James Trefil, no logical reconstruction can attain <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, although Trefil concedes that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s may become conscious in some new way.</p>
<p>At what point do we consider an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> to be conscious, to be self-aware, to have <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>? How do we distinguish a process that is conscious from one that just acts as if it is conscious? If the <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is very convincing when it says, "I'm lonely, please keep me company," does that settle the issue?</p>
<p>If you ask the "person" in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, it will strenuously claim to be the original person. If we scan, let's say, me and reinstate that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural computer</a>, the person who emerges will think he is (and has been) me (or at least he will act that way). He will say, "I grew up in Queens, New York, went to college at M.I.T., stayed in the Boston area, walked into a scanner there and woke up in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> here. Hey, this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> really works." But wait, is this really me? For one thing, old Ray (that's me) still exists in my <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>Will the new <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> be capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s? Because its <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> processes are effectively identical, its behavior will be comparable to that of the person it is based on. So it will certainly claim to have the full range of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s that a person claims to have.</p>
<p>No <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive test can absolutely determine <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. We cannot <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ively measure <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> (this has to do with the very <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s "<a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive" and "subjective"). We can measure only correlates of it, such as behavior. The new entities will appear to be conscious, and whether or not they actually are will not affect their behavior. Just as we debate today the <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of nonhuman entities such as <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, we will surely debate the potential <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> intelligent entities. From a practical perspective, we will accept their claims. They'll get mad if we don't.</p>
<p>Before the next century is over, the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a> tells us, <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>-us-will <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with our own <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. And when that happens, we might ask: What is the difference between a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> enhanced a millionfold by <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s and a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> based on the reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that is subsequently enhanced and expanded?</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> used its innovation from one period (humans) to create the next (intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s). The subsequent milestone will be for the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to create their own next generation without <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intervention.</p>
<p>An <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process accelerates because it builds on its own means for further <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Humans have beaten <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. We are creating intelligent entities in considerably less <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> than it took the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process that created us. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>--a product of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>--has transcended it. So, too, the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that we are now creating in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will soon exceed the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of its creators.</p>

<br>
It occurs to me that much of the emotion, and thus the resultant decisions, of a human brain are tremendously influenced by the rest of the host body (hormones, pain, etc.)  In addition, the function of a human brain is greatly influenced by biological defects in that brain tissue.

Will not an intelligence manisfested in electronic circuitry be greatly diminished in emotional capacity without these influences?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The question of "diminishment due to lack of bodily-driven (and evolutionarily-useful) emotions" is one that has several answers.
<br>
<br>
If we expect a future (substrate+intelligence) to upload and support our continuing senses of personal consciousness, we had better ensure that it is capable, at least initially, in being able to supply  us with both the input-stimulus and output sense-of-control that we currently experience of "body", to include the "mental" effects of hormonal, adrenal, and other "expected feelings".  Otherwise, we might be "aware but unfeeling", or at least, very psychically disoriented.  If this "Sysop" were to cede us additional control over these parameters, we might be able to enhance them, diminish them, or supplant them with new ones, as we saw fit.
<br>
<br>
On the subject of the Super-AI itself (that would be maintaining this Virtual Environment on our behalf,) we would not WANT it to be slave to such emotional disturbances, and there is no a-priori reason that it would, not having "evolved" its sense of "mind" in a melieu of kill-or-be-killed, blood-is-thicker-than-water entities.
<br>
<br>
However (third answer), as far as the new-substrate supporting additional "artificial" consciousnesses, they must be viewed as sentient beings in their own right, but what they might feel or not feel is hard to imagine.  Whether (given a "large-enough intelligence-space" they might appear spontaneously is another good question.  All the more reason to (try) to design a Super-AI without "bad" (misguided) feelings, to act in the role of "benevolence".  The goal, a sort of Friendly Sysop.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"But wait, is this really me? For one thing, old Ray (that's me) still exists in my carbon-cell-based brain." - Ray Kurzweil, from article above.
<br>
<br>
Ray, I would like to address your thoughts above on downloading a mind to a computer. 
<br>
<br>
The problem like you stated is that the original person still exists. If one claims that the new person is the same as the old person then one violates Aristotle's law of the exluded middle: A thing cannot be itself and not itself at the same time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
How about this as a solution:
<br>
<br>
Why not use quantum teleportation to entangle particles somehow with our brain so that they extract our mind's information out (e.g. neural interconnections and whatever else we need). 
<br>
But instead of teleporting the information (quantum states representing the information) into real neurons, we could teleport them into artificial neurons and achieve immortality. 
<br>
<br>
Since the contents of the original mind would be 
<br>
instanteously destroyed (quantum teleportation would do this) as the new mind is instantaneously created, We would not violate Aristotle's law of the excluded middle.
<br>
<br>
Does this sound nuts or possible?
<br>

<br>
There are other, more straight-forward methods of teleportation which are more feasable then so-called "quantum teleportation".  Such as a mere transfer of the data representing the positions and types of all of your atomic and molecular structuring to a nano assembler device which can build an exact replica of your functioning body atom by atom at the new location.  Though I guess the problem you are trying to overcome is the light speed limitation.  Good luck on that one.
<br>
<br>
One possible method of achieving "FTL" travel is to send your body-construction-data via ether flow highways in which (as fizeau demonstrated with water) the speed of light would be additive to the speed of the flowing, light-transmitting material.  How to construct (or discover) these highways is another (highly untrainable) animal altogether.

<br>
<br>
Causality works in time and not outside it. In fact causality is part of the unity that is matter-in-motion (nothing else exists). If you ever could escape from causality what could ever CAUSE you to get back into it? Escaping causality is therefore the same thing as not existing, which is impossible for something that exists.  If you are going to cause something to happen i.e. self-duplication, then you are going to have some sort of time delay as cause is translated into effect.
<br>
<br>
What is a few milliseconds (or even millenia) in eternity?  How could you ever fit all the action involved in the self-transformation into an zero-size (therefore nonexistent) instant?  What difference would instananeity make in this teleportation scheme?  Would it mean because it was instantaneous that your self-trajectory was unbroken and therefore it was still you?  
<br>
<br>
In the end it is YOU who decides whether or not your new self is "you" and I bet I can guess the answer!  Pure semantics.
<br>
<br>
&gt;Yes, I thought about the gradual approach too. I guess I dropped it in favour of a non-invasive scanning approach (quantum teleportation).&lt; 
<br>
<br>
There is no non-invasive scanning approach because there is no action-at-a-distance ;), but there certainly are non-destructive approaches other than the Q-Tele one e.g. nano-bot scanning.
<br>
<br>
&gt;As far as the multiple me problem I still think that the copies would be copies and not me.&lt;
<br>
<br>
Again, pure semantics.  This is an arbitrary choice on how loose or tight to define your self concept. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Unless you buy David Deutch's multiple universe interpretation of QM. &lt;
<br>
<br>
Not that it fits into this discussion because of your discalimer, but NO I don't buy into that pyramid scheme, not in the least.  Apart from the fact that 'Universe' means that there is only UNI, it is a ludicrous attempt to interpret the accounting errors at the core of modern physics.

&gt;"Why not use quantum teleportation to entangle particles somehow with our brain so that they extract our mind's information out "
<br>
<br>
You do not need quantum teleportation to extract the functionality of the mind from the brain.  You simply do a functional analysis, run a simulation, or build a prototype with the upgraded functional aggregates to run it through some tests or whatever and then build and check the full version.  There it is your more matter-and-energy efficient duplicate. It is an arbitrary choice of when and IF you destroy the original... 
<br>
<br>
If you simply want to transfer to a more stable and controllable substrate then I suggest that you upgrade your neural modules one at a time with the more efficient artificial modules, always keeping an eye on the continued exact functioning of your mind during the upgrade process.  This way you are not left with the philosophical conundrum of whether or not to destroy the original who still is YOU!
<br>
<br>
No doubt, as grant pointed out, this upgrade will forever and DRASTICALLY alter your self-trajectory.

<br>
<br>
The mind is shaped by the input it receives and what it does with that input afterward.  Thus if two minds are receiving different input, they will become different from that point on.  They only way they could stay the same is if both could transfer all input and the ideas they craft from it back and forth to each other on an ongoing basis.  It doesn't seem feasible that both minds could process the input from two bodies at the same time and still operate at an optimal level.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but the mind we use today is occupied 24/7 with the current amount of input and processing it must do.  Double that, and who knows what the result would be?  Of course, minds can and no doubt will be enhanced in the future, and this may solve the problem. But dealing with the duplication of minds in a very complex problem and there are lots of issues we haven't even thought about yet.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I should have used the phrase "can be derived from" instead of "based on" since Ayn Rand came after Aristotle. At any rate to go from the axioms of existence and conscious to the laws of logic is easy. Let me show you.
<br>
<br>
if existence exists then things exist. 
<br>
<br>
Non-existence can't exist or else this leads to contradiction. 
<br>
<br>
To exist is to exist as something specific - 
<br>
<br>
If to exist is to exist as something totally non-specific then there would only be non-existence.
<br>
<br>
Therefore to exist is to exist as something specific or A is A or a thing is itself.
<br>
<br>
Since A is A then A can't be non-A. or a thing can't be not itself. 
<br>
<br>
Therefore to exist as A and non-A at the same time is impossible or a thing can not exist as itself and not-itself at the same time.
<br>
<br>
Therefore I can't be myself and my copy at the same time. There must be some differences between us (due to copying delays???). Therefore it is impossible to create an exact copy of myself.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>All this 'scientific' discourse is really amusing on a number of levels.  Firstly, the fact that it basically ignores all the great thinkers of consciousness from Heidegger to Merleau-Ponty and, secondly, because it fails to address any of the critiques Lyotard, Foucault and others have made of its supposed legitimacy.
<br>
<br>
It is rather ridiculous that Kurzweil has been accused of having an 'impoverished view of spirituality' when his thinking is so shamelessly theistic and dialectical.  The blatant resurrection of the One (one consciousness, one intelligence saturating all space and time, etc.) is so awfully theistic has no right to claim itself as anything other than some kind-of mystical fiction.  Reading Kurzweil and the other thinkers of Strong AI, one is confronted with extremely Hegelian (another thinker not mentioned anywhere) notions of 'rising' towards Absolute Spirit; notions so backwards and silly it is small wonder the topic hasn't been taken more seriously by the philosophical community at large (Badiou, Zizek, etc.). 
<br>
<br>
In the Kurzweilian narrative humanity is exponentially progressing towards a 'Singularity' (a point beyond which nothing can be reliably conceived).  Isn't this in fact nothing more than a tautology parading as scientific discourse that serves to legitimate such theological ideas as the One?  Scientific, mathematical and/or technological events, like all events, are unpredictable, they don't follow the simple-minded teleology put-forth by Kurzweil, so in a sense, this 'singularity'  could take-place tomorrow.  
<br>
<br>
All of these articles and all of this chatter can essentially be boiled down to the claim that humanity is 'progressing' towards One Super Intelligence ...  Yet, none of it makes an even slight advance towards solving the fundamental problems confronting Strong A.I. (proof of consciousness whatsoever, a definition of the subject, a software or mathematics that would make self-reflexivity possible, etc.)  Furthermore,  these backwards theistic dialectical ideas of progress (to move forward or develop to a higher, 'better', more advanced stage) which have been completely destabilized by philosophical postmodernism are so preposterously assumptive they warrant no well-reasoned criticism (Better??!!  Positing a faster, more complex intelligence, with more information at its disposal does nothing in the way of addressing the consciousness of consciousness as such ' Nor does it explain this whole mystical assumption of better-ness). 
<br>
<br>
I am believer that the technologies being celebrated here have the potential to answer some of the most profound questions imaginable, and am certainly open to the idea that this is the last generation of humans that will be biologically identical to those from 10,000 years ago, but all this backwards religiosity parading as science does nothing to help this goal.  
<br>
<br>
One MUST contend with not only the poltical dimension implicit in the developement of technology, but its narrative dimension and what that narrative legitimates and privelges and for what reason it does this...  None of this is addressed here.  On top of that, as said earlier, all of the REAL attempts at defining subjectivity philosophically (outside of Hofstader ... like Deleuze, for example) are completely ignored here.
