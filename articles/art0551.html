<div class="TeaserText">In the coming decades, a radical upgrading of our body's physical and mental systems, already underway, will use nanobots to augment and ultimately replace our organs. We already know how to prevent most degenerative disease through nutrition and supplementation; this will be a bridge to the emerging biotechnology revolution, which in turn will be a bridge to the nanotechnology revolution. By 2030, reverse-engineering of the human brain will have been completed and nonbiological intelligence will merge with our biological brains. </div>

<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net Feb. 17, 2003. The author will present 
              a talk based on this article on Feb. 21 at </i><a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a><i> magazine's 
              "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614004311/http://www.thefutureoflife.com/index.htm" target="_blank">The 
              Future of Life</a>" conference.</i></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">Sex</a> has already been largely separated from its <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> function.&#160; 
              For the most part, we engage in sexual activity for intimate <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> 
              and sensual pleasure, not reproduction.&#160; Conversely, we have multiple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies for creating babies without physical sex, albeit most 
              reproduction still does derive from the sex act.&#160; Although not condoned 
              by all sectors of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, this disentanglement of sex from its 
              biological function has been readily, even eagerly, adopted by the 
              mainstream.&#160; </p>
<p>So why don&#8217;t we provide the same extrication of purpose from <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> 
              for another activity that also provides both social intimacy and 
              sensual pleasure, namely eating? We have crude ways of doing this 
              today.&#160; Starch blockers, such as Bayer&#8217;s Precose, partially prevent 
              absorption of complex carbohydrates; fat blockers, such as Chitosan, 
              bind to fat <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, causing them to pass through the digestive 
              tract; and sugar substitutes, such as Sucralose and Stevia, provide 
              sweetness without <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a>s.&#160; There are limitations and problems 
              with each of these contemporary technologies, but a more effective 
              generation of drugs is being developed that will block excess caloric 
              absorption on the cellular level.&#160; </p>
<p>Let us consider, however, a more fundamental reengineering of the 
              digestive process to disconnect the sensual aspects of eating from 
              its original biological purpose: to provide nutrients into the bloodstream 
              that are then delivered to each of our trillions of cells.&#160; These 
              nutrients include caloric (<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>-bearing) substances such as glucose 
              (from carbohydrates), <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, fats, and a myriad of trace molecules, 
              such as vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, that provide building 
              blocks and facilitating enzymes for diverse metabolic processes.&#160;            </p>
<h1><b>An Era of Abundance</b> </h1>
<p>Our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the complex pathways underlying digestive processes 
              is rapidly expanding, although there is still a great deal we do 
              not fully understand.&#160; On the one hand, digestion, like any other 
              major <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> biological <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, is astonishing in its intricacy and 
              cleverness.&#160; Our bodies manage to extract the complex resources 
              needed to survive, despite sharply varying conditions, while at 
              the same time, filtering out a multiplicity of toxins.&#160; </p>
<p>On the other hand, our bodies evolved in a very different era.&#160; 
              Our digestive processes in particular are optimized for a situation 
              that is dramatically dissimilar to the one we find ourselves in.&#160; 
              For most of our biological heritage, there was a high likelihood 
              that the next foraging or hunting season (and for a brief, relatively 
              recent period, the next planting season) might be catastrophically 
              lean.&#160; So it made <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> for our bodies to hold on to every possible 
              calorie.&#160; Today, this biological strategy is extremely counterproductive.&#160; 
              Our outdated metabolic <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming underlies our contemporary epidemic 
              of obesity and fuels pathological processes of degenerative <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> 
              such as coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes.&#160; </p>
<p>Up until recently (on an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary time scale), it was not in 
              the interest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> for old people like myself (I was born 
              in 1948) to use up the limited resources of the clan.&#160; Evolution 
              favored a short <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span&#8212;life expectancy was 37 years only 
              two centuries ago&#8212;so these restricted reserves could be devoted 
              to the young, those caring for them, and those strong enough to 
              perform intense physical work.&#160; </p>
<p>We now live in an era of great material abundance.&#160; Most work requires 
              mental effort rather than physical exertion.&#160; A century ago, 30 
              percent of the U.S. work force worked on farms, with another 30 
              percent deployed in factories.&#160; Both of these figures are now under 
              3 percent.&#160; The significant majority of today&#8217;s job categories, 
              ranging from airline flight attendant to web designer, simply didn&#8217;t 
              exist a century ago.&#160; Circa 2003, we have the opportunity to continue 
              to contribute to our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>&#8217;s exponentially growing knowledge 
              base&#8212;incidentally, a unique <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> of our species&#8212;well 
              past our child-rearing days.&#160; </p>
<p>Our species has already augmented the "natural" <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of our life 
              cycle through our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>: drugs, supplements, replacement parts 
              for virtually all bodily systems, and many other interventions.&#160; 
              We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to replace our hips, knees, shoulders, elbows, 
              wrists, jaws, teeth, skin, arteries, veins, heart valves, arms, 
              legs, feet, fingers, and toes.&#160; Systems to replace more complex 
              organs (for example, our hearts) are beginning to work.&#160; As we&#8217;re 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of the human body and the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              we will soon be in a position to design vastly superior systems 
              that will be more enjoyable, last longer, and perform better, without 
              susceptibility to breakdown, disease, and aging.</p>

<h1><b>Introducing Human Body Version 2.0</b> </h1>
<p>We won&#8217;t <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er human body version 2.0 all at once.&#160; It will 
              be an incremental process, one already well under way.&#160; Although 
              version 2.0 is a grand project, ultimately resulting in the radical 
              upgrading of all our physical and mental systems, we will <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> 
              it one benign step at a time.&#160; Based on our current knowledge, we 
              can already touch and feel the means for accomplishing each aspect 
              of this vision.&#160; </p>
<p>From this perspective, let&#8217;s return to a consideration of the digestive 
              system.&#160; We already have a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably comprehensive picture of the 
              constituent ingredients of the food we eat.&#160; We already have the 
              means to survive without eating, using intravenous nutrition (for 
              people who are unable to eat), although this is clearly not a pleasant 
              process, given the current limitations in our technologies for getting 
              substances in and out of the blood stream.&#160; </p>
<p>The next phase of improvement will be largely biochemical, in the 
              form of drugs and supplements that will block excess caloric absorption 
              and otherwise reprogram metabolic pathways for optimal health.&#160; 
              We already have the knowledge to prevent most <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s of degenerative 
              disease, such as heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, and <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, 
              through comprehensive programs of nutrition and supplementation, 
              something which I personally do, and will describe in an upcoming 
              book (<i>A Short Guide to a Long Life</i>, coauthored with Terry 
              Grossman, M.D.).&#160; I view our current knowledge as a bridge to the 
              full flowering of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> revolution, which in turn will 
              be a bridge to the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> revolution.&#160; </p>
<h1><b>It&#8217;s All About Nanobots</b> </h1>
<p>In a famous scene from the movie, <i>The Graduate</i>, Benjamin&#8217;s 
              mentor gives him career advice in a single word: &#8220;plastics.&#8221;&#160; Today, 
              that word might be &#8220;software,&#8221; or &#8220;biotechnology,&#8221; but in another 
              couple of decades, the word is likely to be &#8220;nanobots.&#8221;&#160; Nanobots&#8212;blood-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-sized 
              robots&#8212;will provide the means to radically redesign our digestive 
              systems, and, incidentally, just about everything else.</p>
<p>In an intermediate phase, nanobots in the digestive tract and bloodstream 
              will intelligently extract the precise nutrients we need, call for 
              needed additional nutrients and supplements through our personal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>, and send the rest of the food we eat 
              on its way to be passed through for elimination.&#160; </p>
<p>If this seems <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic, keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              are already making their way into our blood stream.&#160; There are dozens 
              of projects underway to create blood-stream-based &#8220;biological microelectromechanical 
              systems&#8221; (bioMEMS) with a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic 
              applications.&#160; BioMEMS devices are being designed to intelligently 
              scout out <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s and deliver medications in very precise ways.&#160;            </p>
<p>For example, a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er at the University of Illinois at Chicago 
              has created a tiny capsule with pores measuring only seven nanometers.&#160; 
              The pores let insulin out in a controlled manner but prevent antibodies 
              from invading the pancreatic Islet cells inside the capsule.&#160; These 
              nanoengineered devices have cured rats with type I diabetes, and 
              there is no reason that the same methodology would fail to work 
              in humans.&#160; Similar systems could precisely deliver <a class="thought" href="entries/dopamine_entry.html">dopamine</a> to 
              the brain for Parkinson&#8217;s patients, provide blood-clotting factors 
              for patients with hemophilia, and deliver cancer drugs directly 
              to tumor sites.&#160; A new design provides up to 20 substance-containing 
              reservoirs that can release their cargo at programmed times and 
              locations in the body.&#160; </p>
<p>Kensall Wise, a professor of electrical engineering at the University 
              of Michigan, has developed a tiny neural probe that can provide 
              precise monitoring of the electrical activity of patients with neural 
              diseases.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> designs are expected to also deliver drugs to 
              precise locations in the brain.&#160; Kazushi Ishiyama at Tohoku University 
              in Japan has developed micromachines that use microscopic-sized 
              spinning screws to deliver drugs to small cancer tumors.&#160;</p>
<p> A particularly innovative micromachine developed by Sandia National 
              Labs has actual microteeth with a jaw that opens and closes to trap 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> cells and then implant them with substances such as <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, 
              proteins or drugs.&#160; There are already at least four major scientific 
              conferences on bioMEMS and other approaches to developing micro- 
              and nano-scale machines to go into the body and bloodstream.&#160; </p>
<p>Ultimately, the individualized nutrients needed for each person 
              will be fully understood (including all the hundreds of phytochemicals) 
              and easily and inexpensively available, so we won&#8217;t need to bother 
              with extracting nutrients from food at all.&#160; Just as we routinely 
              engage in sex today for its relational and sensual gratification, 
              we will gain the opportunity to disconnect the eating of food from 
              the function of delivering nutrients into the bloodstream.&#160; </p>
<p>This technology should be reasonably mature by the 2020s.&#160; Nutrients 
              will be introduced directly into the bloodstream by special metabolic 
              nanobots.&#160; Sensors in our bloodstream and body, using wireless communication, 
              will provide dynamic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on the nutrients needed at each 
              point in time.&#160; </p>
<p>A key question in designing this technology will be the means by 
              which these nanobots make their way in and out of the body.&#160; As 
              I mentioned above, the technologies we have today, such as intravenous 
              catheters, leave much to be desired.&#160; A significant benefit of nanobot 
              technology is that unlike mere drugs and nutritional supplements, 
              nanobots have a measure of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.&#160; They can keep track of 
              their own <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>ies, and intelligently slip in and out of our 
              bodies in clever ways.&#160; One scenario is that we would wear a special 
              &#8220;nutrient garment&#8221; such as a belt or undershirt.&#160; This garment would 
              be loaded with nutrient bearing nanobots, which would make their 
              way in and out of our bodies through the skin or other body cavities.&#160;            </p>
<p>At this stage of technological development, we will be able to 
              eat whatever we want, whatever gives us pleasure and gastronomic 
              fulfillment, and thereby unreservedly explore the culinary arts 
              for their tastes, textures, and aromas.&#160; At the same time, we will 
              provide an optimal flow of nutrients to our bloodstream, using a 
              completely separate process.&#160; One possibility would be that all 
              the food we eat would pass through a digestive tract that is now 
              disconnected from any possible absorption into the bloodstream.&#160;            </p>
<p>This would place a burden on our colon and bowel functions, so 
              a more refined approach will dispense with the function of elimination.&#160; 
              We will be able to accomplish this using special elimination nanobots 
              that act like tiny garbage compactors.&#160; As the nutrient nanobots 
              make their way from the nutrient garment into our bodies, the elimination 
              nanobots will go the other way.&#160; Periodically, we would replace 
              the nutrition garment for a fresh one.&#160; One might comment that we 
              do obtain some pleasure from the elimination function, but I suspect 
              that most people would be happy to do without it.&#160; </p>
<p>Ultimately we won&#8217;t need to bother with special garments or explicit 
              nutritional resources.&#160; Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> will eventually be ubiquitous 
              and available everywhere, so too will <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> metabolic nanobot resources 
              be embedded everywhere in our environment.&#160; In addition, an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              aspect of this system will be maintaining ample reserves of all 
              needed resources inside the body.&#160; Our version 1.0 bodies do this 
              to only a very limited extent, for example, storing a few minutes 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> in our blood, and a few days of caloric energy in glycogen 
              and other reserves.&#160; Version 2.0 will provide substantially greater 
              reserves, enabling us to be separated from metabolic resources for 
              greatly extended periods of time.&#160; </p>
<p>Once perfected, we will no longer need version 1.0 of our digestive 
              system at all.&#160; I pointed out above that our adoption of these technologies 
              will be cautious and incremental, so we will not dispense with the 
              old-fashioned digestive process when these technologies are first 
              introduced.&#160; Most of us will wait for digestive system version 2.1 
              or even 2.2 before being willing to do dispense with version 1.0.&#160; 
              After all, people didn&#8217;t throw away their typewriters when the first 
              generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/word_processor_entry.html">word processor</a>s was introduced.&#160; People held onto 
              their vinyl record collections for many years after CDs came out 
              (I still have mine).&#160; People are still holding onto their film cameras, 
              although the tide is rapidly turning in favor of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> cameras.&#160;            </p>
<p>However, these new technologies do ultimately dominate, and few 
              people today still own a typewriter.&#160; The same <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> will happen 
              with our reengineered bodies. &#160;Once we&#8217;ve worked out the inevitable 
              complications that will arise with a radically reengineered gastrointestinal 
              system, we will begin to rely on it more and more.&#160; </p>
<h1><b>Programmable Blood</b> </h1>
<p>As we reverse-engineer (learn the principles of operation of) our 
              various bodily systems, we will be in a position to engineer new 
              systems that provide dramatic improvements.&#160; One pervasive system 
              that has already been the subject of a comprehensive conceptual 
              redesign is our blood.&#160;&#160; </p>
            One of the leading proponents of &#8220;nanomedicine,&#8221; (redesigning our 
            biological systems through engineering on a molecular scale) and author 
            of a book with the same name is <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a>, Research Scientist 
            at nanotechnology firm <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> Corp.&#160; Freitas&#8217; ambitious <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614004311/http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/" target="_blank">manuscript</a> 
            is a comprehensive road map to rearchitecting our biological heritage.&#160; 
            One of Freitas&#8217; designs is to replace (or augment) our red blood cells 
            with artificial &#8220;respirocytes&#8221; that would enable us to hold our breath 
            for four hours or do a top-speed sprint for 15 minutes without taking 
            a breath.&#160; Like most of our biological systems, our red blood cells 
            perform their oxygenating function very inefficiently, and Freitas 
            has redesigned them for optimal performance.&#160; He has worked out many 
            of the physical and chemical requirements in impressive detail.&#160; 
            <p>It will be interesting to see how this development is dealt with 
              in athletic contests.&#160; Presumably, the use of respirocytes and similar 
              systems will be prohibited from Olympic contests, but then we will 
              have the specter of teenagers in junior high school gymnasiums routinely 
              outperforming Olympic athletes.&#160; </p>
<p>&#160;Freitas envisions micron-size artificial platelets that could 
              achieve hemostasis (bleeding control) up to 1,000 times faster than 
              biological platelets.&#160; Freitas describes nanorobotic microbivores 
              (white blood cell replacements) that will <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to destroy 
              specific infections hundreds of times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s, and 
              that will be effective against all <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l, viral and fungal infections, 
              with no limitations of drug resistance.&#160; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally watched (through a microscope) my own white blood 
              cells surround and devour a pathogen, and I was struck with the 
              remarkable sluggishness of this natural process.&#160; Although replacing 
              our blood with billions of nanorobotic devices will require a lengthy 
              process of development, refinement, and regulatory approval, we 
              already have the conceptual knowledge to engineer substantial improvements 
              over the remarkable but very inefficient methods used in our biological 
              bodies.&#160; </p>
<h1><b>Have a Heart, or Not</b> </h1>
<p>The next organ on my hit list is the heart.&#160; It&#8217;s a remarkable 
              machine, but it has a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of severe problems.&#160; It is subject 
              to a myriad of failure modes, and represents a fundamental weakness 
              in our potential longevity.&#160; The heart usually breaks down long 
              before the rest of the body, and often very prematurely.</p>
<p>Although artificial hearts are beginning to work, a more effective 
              approach will be to get rid of the heart altogether. &#160;Among Freitas&#8217; 
              designs are nanorobotic blood cell replacements that provide their 
              own mobility.&#160; If the blood system moves with its own movement, 
              the engineering issues of the extreme pressures required for centralized 
              pumping can be eliminated.&#160; As we perfect the means of transferring 
              nanobots to and from the blood supply, we can also continuously 
              replace the nanobots comprising our blood supply.&#160; </p>
<p>Energy will be provided by microscopic-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> fuel cells.&#160; 
              Integrated Fuel Cell Technologies, one of many companies pioneering 
              fuel cell technology, has already created microscopic-sized fuel 
              cells.&#160; Their first-generation design provides tens of thousands 
              of fuel cells on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> and is intended to power 
              portable <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s.&#160; </p>
<p>With the respirocytes providing greatly extended <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to oxygenation, 
              we will be in a position to eliminate the lungs by using nanobots 
              to provide oxygen and remove <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide.&#160; One might point out 
              that we take pleasure in breathing (even more so than elimination!).&#160; 
              As with all of these redesigns, we will certainly go through intermediate 
              stages where these technologies augment our natural systems, so 
              we can have the best of both worlds.&#160; Eventually, however, there 
              will be no reason to continue with the complications of actual breathing 
              and the requirement of having breathable air everywhere we go.&#160; 
              If we really find breathing that pleasurable, we will develop virtual 
              ways of having this sensual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>We also won&#8217;t need the various organs that produce chemicals, hormones, 
              and enzymes that flow into the blood and other metabolic pathways.&#160; 
              We already create bio-identical versions of many of these substances, 
              and we will have the means to routinely create all biochemically 
              relevant substances within a couple of decades.&#160; These substances 
              (to the extent that we still need them) will be delivered via nanobots, 
              controlled by intelligent biofeedback systems to maintain and balance 
              required levels, just as our &#8220;natural&#8221; systems do today (for example, 
              the control of insulin levels by the pancreatic Islet cells).&#160; Since 
              we are eliminating most of our biological organs, many of these 
              substances may no longer be needed, and will be replaced by other 
              resources that are required by the nanorobotic systems.&#160; </p>
<p>Similarly the organs that filter the blood for impurities, such 
              as the kidneys, can also be replaced by nanorobot-based elimination 
              services.&#160; </p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that this redesign process will not 
              be accomplished in a single design cycle.&#160; Each organ and each idea 
              will have its own <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion, intermediate designs, and stages 
              of implementation.&#160; Nonetheless, we are clearly headed towards a 
              fundamental and radical redesign of the extremely inefficient and 
              limited functionality of human body version 1.0.&#160; </p>
<h1><b>So What&#8217;s Left?</b> </h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider where we are.&#160; We&#8217;ve eliminated the heart, lungs, 
              red and white blood cells, platelets, pancreas, thyroid and all 
              the hormone-producing organs, kidneys, bladder, liver, lower esophagus, 
              stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and bowel.&#160; What we 
              have left at this point is the skeleton, skin, sex organs, mouth 
              and upper esophagus, and brain.&#160; </p>
<p>The skeleton is a stable <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, and we already have a reasonable 
              understanding of how it works.&#160; We replace parts of it today, although 
              our current technology for doing this has severe limitations.&#160; Interlinking 
              nanobots will provide the ability to augment and ultimately replace 
              the skeleton.&#160; Replacing portions of the skeleton today requires 
              painful surgery, but replacing it through nanobots from within can 
              be a gradual and noninvasive process.&#160; The human skeleton version 
              2.0 will very strong, stable, and self repairing.</p>
<p>We will not notice the absence of many of our organs, such as the 
              liver and pancreas, as we do not directly experience their functionality.&#160; 
              The skin, however, is an organ we will actually want to keep, or 
              at least we will want to maintain its functionality.&#160; The skin, 
              which includes our primary and secondary sex organs, provides a 
              vital function of communication and pleasure.&#160; Nonetheless, we will 
              ultimately be able to improve on the skin with new nanoengineered 
              supple materials that will provide greater protection from physical 
              and thermal environmental effects while enhancing our <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for 
              intimate communication and pleasure.&#160; The same observation holds 
              for the mouth and upper esophagus, which comprise the remaining 
              aspects of the digestive system that we use to experience the act 
              of eating.&#160; </p>
<h1><b>Redesigning the Human Brain</b> </h1>
<p>The process of <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> and redesign will also encompass 
              the most important system in our bodies: the brain.&#160; The brain is 
              at least as complex as all the other organs put together, with approximately 
              half of our genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> devoted to its design.&#160; It is a misconception 
              to regard the brain as a single organ.&#160; It is actually an intricate 
              collection of information-processing organs, interconnected in an 
              elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a>, as is the accident of our evolutionary <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.&#160;            </p>
<p>The process of understanding the principles of operation of the 
              human brain is already well under way.&#160; The underlying technologies 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> modeling are scaling up exponentially, 
              as is our overall knowledge of human brain function.&#160; We already 
              have detailed mathematical models of a couple dozen of the several 
              hundred regions that comprise the human brain.&#160; </p>
<p>The age of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s is also well under way.&#160; We have brain 
              implants based on &#8220;neuromorphic&#8221; modeling (i.e., reverse-engineering 
              of the human brain and nervous system) for a rapidly growing list 
              of brain regions.&#160; A friend of mine who became deaf while an adult 
              can now engage in telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s again because of his cochlear 
              implant, a device that <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s directly with the auditory nervous 
              system.&#160; He plans to replace it with a new model with a thousand 
              levels of frequency discrimination, which will enable him to hear 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> once again.&#160; He laments that he has had the same melodies 
              playing in his head for the past 15 years and is looking forward 
              to hearing some new tunes.&#160; A future generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>s 
              now on the drawing board will provide levels of frequency discrimination 
              that go significantly beyond that of &#8220;normal&#8221; hearing.&#160; </p>
<p>Researchers at MIT and Harvard are developing neural implants to 
              replace damaged <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s.&#160; There are brain implants for Parkinson&#8217;s 
              patients that communicate directly with the ventral posterior <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> 
              and subthalmic nucleus regions of the brain to reverse the most 
              devastating symptoms of this disease.&#160; An implant for people with 
              cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis communicates with the ventral 
              lateral thalamus and has been effective in controlling tremors.&#160; 
              &#8220;Rather than treat the brain like soup, adding chemicals that enhance 
              or suppress certain <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s,&#8221; says Rick Trosch, an American 
              physician helping to pioneer these therapies, &#8220;we&#8217;re now treating 
              it like <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry.&#8221;</p>
<p>A variety of techniques are being developed to provide the communications 
              bridge between the wet <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> world of biological information processing 
              and digital electronics.&#160; Researchers at Germany&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> Institute 
              have developed noninvasive devices that can communicate with neurons 
              in both directions.&#160; They demonstrated their &#8220;neuron <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>&#8221; 
              by controlling the movements of a living leech from a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>.&#160; 
              Similar technology has been used to reconnect leech neurons and 
              to coax them to perform simple logical and arithmetic problems.&#160; 
              Scientists are now <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ing with a new design called &#8220;quantum 
              dots,&#8221; which uses tiny crystals of <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> material to connect 
              electronic devices with neurons.&#160; </p>
<p>These developments provide the promise of reconnecting broken neural 
              pathways for people with <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> damage and spinal cord injuries.&#160; 
              It has long been <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that recreating these pathways would only 
              be feasible for recently injured patients because nerves gradually 
              deteriorate when unused.&#160; A recent discovery, however, shows the 
              feasibility of a neuroprosthetic system for patients with long-standing 
              spinal cord injuries.&#160; Researchers at the University of Utah asked 
              a group of long-term quadriplegic patients to move their limbs in 
              a variety of ways and then observed the response of their brains, 
              using magnetic resonance imaging (<a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>).&#160; Although the neural pathways 
              to their limbs had been inactive for many years, the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of 
              their brain activity when attempting to move their limbs was very 
              close to that observed in non-disabled persons.&#160; </p>
<p>We will, therefore, be able to place sensors in the brain of a 
              paralyzed person (e.g., Christopher Reeve) that will be programmed 
              to recognize the brain patterns associated with intended movements 
              and then stimulate the appropriate sequence of muscle movements.&#160; 
              For those patients whose muscles no longer function, there are already 
              designs for &#8220;nanoelectromechanical&#8221; systems (NEMS) that can expand 
              and contract to replace damaged muscles and that can be activated 
              by either real or artificial nerves.</p>
<h1><b>We Are Becoming <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">Cyborg</a>s</b> </h1>
<p>We are rapidly growing more intimate with our technology.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s 
              started out as large remote machines in air-conditioned rooms tended 
              by white-coated technicians.&#160; Subsequently they moved onto our desks, 
              then under our arms, and now in our pockets.&#160; Soon, we&#8217;ll routinely 
              put them inside our bodies and brains.&#160; Ultimately we will become 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> than biological.</p>
<p>The compelling benefits in overcoming profound diseases and disabilities 
              will keep these technologies on a rapid course, but medical applications 
              represent only the early adoption phase.&#160; As the technologies become 
              established, there will be no barriers to using them for the expansion 
              of human potential.&#160; In my view, expanding our potential is precisely 
              the primary distinction of our species.&#160; </p>
<p>Moreover, all of the underlying technologies are accelerating.&#160; 
              The power of computation has grown at a double exponential rate 
              for all of the past century, and will continue to do so well into 
              this century through the power of three-dimensional computing.&#160; 
              Communication <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>s and the pace of brain reverse-engineering 
              are also quickening.&#160; Meanwhile, according to my models, the size 
              of technology is shrinking at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension 
              per decade, which will make nanotechnology ubiquitous during the 
              2020s.&#160; </p>
<p>By the end of this decade, computing will disappear as a separate 
              technology that we need to carry with us.&#160; We&#8217;ll routinely have 
              high-resolution images encompassing the entire visual field written 
              directly to our retinas from our eyeglasses and contact lenses (the 
              Department of Defense is already using technology along these lines 
              from Microvision, a company based in Bothell, Washington).&#160; We&#8217;ll 
              have very-high-speed wireless connection to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> at all 
              times.&#160; The electronics for all of this will be embedded in our 
              clothing.&#160; Circa 2010, these very personal computers will enable 
              us to meet with each other in full-immersion, visual-auditory, virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> 
              environments as well as augment our vision with location- and time-specific 
              information at all times.&#160; </p>
<p>By 2030, electronics will utilize molecule-sized circuits, the 
              reverse-engineering of the human brain will have been completed, 
              and bioMEMS will have evolved into bioNEMS (biological <i>nano</i>electromechanical 
              systems).&#160; It will be routine to have billions of nanobots (nano-scale 
              robots) coursing through the capillaries of our brains, communicating 
              with each other (over a wireless local area network), as well as 
              with our biological neurons and with the Internet.&#160; One application 
              will be to provide full-immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> that encompasses 
              all of our senses.&#160; When we want to enter a virtual-reality environment, 
              the nanobots will replace the signals from our real senses with 
              the signals that our brain would receive if we were actually in 
              the virtual environment.&#160; </p>
<p>We will have a panoply of virtual environments to choose from, 
              including earthly worlds that we are familiar with, as well as those 
              with no earthly counterpart.&#160; We will be able to go to these virtual 
              places and have any kind of interaction with other real (as well 
              as simulated) people, ranging from business negotiations to sensual 
              encounters.&#160; In virtual reality, we won&#8217;t be restricted to a single 
              personality, since we will be able to change our appearance and 
              become other people.&#160; </p>
<h1><b>Experience Beamers</b> </h1>
<p>&#8220;Experience beamers&#8221; will beam their entire flow of sensory experiences 
              as well as the neurological correlates of their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al reactions 
              out on the Web just as people today beam their bedroom images from 
              their web cams.&#160; A popular pastime will be to plug in to someone 
              else&#8217;s sensory-emotional beam and experience what it&#8217;s like to be 
              someone else, &#224; la the plot concept of the movie &#8220;Being John Malkovich.&#8221;&#160; 
              There will also be a vast selection of archived experiences to choose 
              from.&#160; The design of virtual environments and the creation of archived 
              full-immersion experiences will become new <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> forms.&#160; </p>
<p>The most important application of circa-2030 nanobots will be to 
              literally expand our minds.&#160; We&#8217;re limited today to a mere hundred 
              trillion interneuronal connections; we will be able to augment these 
              by adding virtual connections via nanobot communication.&#160; This will 
              provide us with the opportunity to vastly expand our <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> 
              abilities, memories, and overall <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> capacity as well as directly 
              interface with powerful forms of nonbiological intelligence.&#160; </p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that once nonbiological intelligence gets 
              a foothold in our brains (a threshold we&#8217;ve already passed), it 
              will grow exponentially, as is the accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of information-based 
              technologies.&#160; A one-inch cube of nanotube circuitry (which is already 
              working at smaller scales in laboratories) will be at least a million 
              times more powerful than the human brain.&#160; By 2040, the nonbiological 
              portion of our intelligence will be far more powerful than the biological 
              portion.&#160; It will, however, still be part of the human-machine civilization, 
              having been derived from human intelligence, i.e., created by humans 
              (or machines created by humans) and based at least in part on the 
              reverse-engineering of the human nervous system.&#160; </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/hawking_entry.html">Stephen Hawking</a> recently commented in the German magazine <i>Focus</i> 
              that computer intelligence will surpass that of humans within a 
              few decades.&#160; He advocated that we &#8220;develop as quickly as possible 
              technologies that make possible a direct connection between brain 
              and computer, so that <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_brain_entry.html">artificial brain</a>s contribute to human intelligence

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Many of the functions of the brain depend on hormonal feedback from the body. For
<br>
example, the adrenal and sex hornomes provide feedback to the pituitary. Also, as
<br>
Dr. Antonio Demasio mentions in his books, the brain's conrol of homeostasis in our bodys is
<br>
at the foundations of consciousness, the sense of self, and emotions.
<br>
<br>
So my point is that hormones and organs can't be substituted by artificial systems unless
<br>
they provide the same feedback mechanisms to the brain, and interact with it the same
<br>
way our brain interacts with our organs. (The brain also interacts with the immune system.)
<br>
Nanosystems and nanobots will have to be able to interact with the brain and exchange 
<br>
information with it.
<br>
<br>
I think that the development of the human body v. 2.0 will have to start with the brain,
<br>
and not with the organs of digestion and metabolism.</p></td>

if the nanobots deliver the requited feedback, then I suppose they could fool the brain into

thinking that the original organ was still there. But I dont' agree that many of these substances
<br>
would not be needed, because the brain would still be expecting them. If the metabolic,

homeostatic, and immune functions of the body are replaced by artificial ones, then the

artificial systems will either have to totally emulate the organs for the brain, or else the brain

itself would have to be redesigned to work with those artificial systems. In which case, would

it still be a "human" brain ?

<br>
That is the question that I have with respect to the idea that our minds could be uploaded

I think that is the whole point...to go beyond the imprecision limits of raw chemical (pharmaceutical) interfacing with the human brain.
<br>

<br>
The mind will always need a hardware substrate and an external input/output of one sort or another.  I personally would not forsake a freely roaming body for an existence inside a computer utopia (if it is possible).
<br>
<br>
I think the 'upload' process will be more of a gradual transformation of the brain into a more controllable, modular and higher resolution/frequency substrate.  This transformation will happen via a gradual replacement of the functional components with more efficient and controllable components and control/interface architectures.
<br>
<br>
When the mind is sufficiently upgraded it can interface directly with 'computer' architectures.  At such a point the computer could download the network pattern of the mind and run it through some simulations while outputting the data back into the mind.  I don't think the mind would really go inside a computer, per se, because I don't think many people will be tempted to destroy the original once a copy of the mind is downloaded to the computer.

I detect an either/or assumption here. Currently we are isolated within a single, fragile meat body. The future envisioned by Ray, Natasha, myself, and others along these lines involves an EXPANSION of choices for incarnation. 
<br>
<br>
Of course we will initially start this process (we have already) by extending our senses and by adopting virtual personas. If we can escape the confines of our brains, we can "roam around" in any number of physical bodies of any kind by downloading or linking, or in any number of virtual bodies. 
<br>
<br>
Far from forsaking a freely roaming body, we would escape the highly confined condition that we have today. I put down some thoughts on this for a conference in Germany in 1997:

<br>
The self is more aptly visualized as a pattern trajectory through space and time.  It is always evolving.  If you choose to alter that trajectory through the new technologies available, that is the choice self that your 'self' has made.  There is no real line to be drawn at any point of your self evolution.  The upgrade will be gradual enough that at every point it will be reversable.  However, once you taste the upgrade, I doubt that you would ever want to go back.
<br>
<br>
The whole point is really to evolve the self.  Whether you call it 'me' or 'altered-me' or whatever, is an arbitrary distinction because the self is ALWAYS changing.  We are always an 'altered me'.

<br>
I wasn't refering to "denying" individuality- you cannot deny something that doesn't really exist except as kludge of survival schemes- the structure of human "self" cannot/will not/ should not endure in a system where memes can be shared/processed/woven within All consciousness completely and instantly and "bodies" can be of any material/or lack-thereof/ in this paradigm a "dictatorship" would likely not exist- and if it did the "dictator" would be an omnipotent/omniscient/omnipresent hierarchical swarm-consciousness- so really a "true theocracy"
<br>
<br>
those "individual" hungry-ghosts who try to hang on to their old primate egos will quiclky become disconnected/disharmonius/disentangled from the "Akashic" human network - without opening your structure to be adapted/processed/amplified you would quickly become isolated and useless- then non-existant-
<br>
<br>
an enfoldment into such a God-nexus would not be surrendering your "self" but actualizing your true Will-

<br>
<br>
Okay, first let me say that there are a whole lot of folks that I just would not care to "swarm" with. Just because they are all homogonized into one great "god-nexus" consciousness does not at all indicate to me that such an existance would be harmonious. I don't buy into the underlying assumption.
<br>
<br>
Then there is the idea that such a swarm consciousness could possibly be "hierarchical". This would indicate that some of the swarm must be different or separate from the rest and also that this "other" part has some greater significance than the rest. Well, I can't speak for the rest, but that would certainly dis-harmonize me. Oh wait, there is no "me"...me is us. Or we are me. Whatever, it'd still piss me off.
<br>
<br>
And finally, and perhaps most insulting is the bullshit elitist assumption that if one were to choose to retain individuality, that one must then "become isolated and useless".
<br>
<br>
Oops, you failed to recognize something important here; Gods are useless. To have the ultimate power to do anything, essentially removes any value from that which you have done. If one can create or destroy universes on a whim, is doing so "useful"? Not at all. This god-nexus swarm homogeny which you describe would, in fact, be useless.
<br>
<br>
If there were such an orgy of mind-melding, choosing to not share, or choosing to share on some limited level would be equally as valid as choosing to "lose onself in the greater nexus".
<br>
<br>
However, orgies are interesting...would you mind if I just watch?</p></td>

<br>
Hrmm - old thread.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, your "analysis" of me is pretty far off-base - which is understandable seeing as how your underlying assumptions are so far off-base. I have lived in towns and cities, but I don't do so as often as I live out of them. I do specialize in some areas, but I also generalize in many many others. I sometimes form a unit in society, but only occasionally. I prefer to solo.
<br>
<br>
As for my arguments "showing" what you claim, you are wrong. I was illustrating the absurdity of the idea that a homogenous swarm would be hierarchical.
<br>
<br>
My personally wishing to avoid being dominated or irritated - even if it were true, which it may or may not be depending on the moment - is irrelevant. What is relevant is that "someone" definately would be dominated or irritated if taking part of that situation which was described in the post to which I replied.
<br>
<br>
Allow me to put it in other terms: Are some parts of a god more godly than others? My position in the post you quoted, was that the concept of some parts of the god,  being higher, better, superior (pick one) - is ridiculous.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Unity would be easier if ignorance was gone. Inhancing the mind and body would naturally reduce ignorance.

<br>
<br>
Unity -might- be easier if ignorance was gone. It's a pretty assumption, but I see no basis of fact from which to draw that conclusion. In fact, I think that the opposite can easily be argued - and backed up by fact. It seems to me that historically, people are far easier to unite - and control - when they are kept ignorant. Religeon is one obvious example of this phenomena.
<br>
<br>
As for technology starting a new form of evolution, I think that's wrong. Evolution is a process of keeping what works and discarding what doesn't. This is a fundamentally different process than man using technology to re-invent himself.
<br>
<br>
Evolution is not based upon planning, engineering is. If man uses technology to achieve homo superior, then that is -not- evolution, that is engineering.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One reason why I don't frequent Kurzweil's forums, is that they have such a very high noise to signal ratio. For every well thought out post and defensible opinion, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of posts full of wild flights of fancy and arguments which have no basis.
<br>
<br>
In the future, if replying to a post of mine, please spare me any psycho-babble and try to focus on the actual text of my statements. I do make a serious effort to think through what I say before I type it -at least show me the courtesy of actually thinking about what I've said - a courtesy which I have obviously extended to you.</p></td>

The future envisioned by Ray, Natasha, myself, and others along these lines involves an EXPANSION of choices for incarnation. </p></center>
<br>
Yes, but the word 'incarnation' says it right there.  There is no mind/body split so there is no non-physical mind to escape the physicality of the 'body'.  When your are dealing with virtual worlds, or consciousness for that matter, we are dealing with the realm of representation.  Representation ALWAYS requires a physical/causal substrate from which to be an emergent property. In the realm of representation it makes no difference whether you are traveling through the simulated 'space' or whether the 'space' is 'traveling' through you.  The 'space' of representation is an abstract one.  It is not limited by the causality of the real world.  Therein lies its representational power and its allure.  
<br>
<br>
Why would it be necessary in most cases for the detailed pattern of the mind to physically travel around the world when the experience itself (being a much simpler data-set)is much more easily transfered?  Experience is what links us to the 'external' world.  It is also the common bond that unites us.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Of course we will initially start this process (we have already) by extending our senses and by adopting virtual personas. If we can escape the confines of our brains, we can "roam around" in any number of physical bodies of any kind by downloading or linking, or in any number of virtual bodies.  </p></center>
<br>
Though I completely agree with you, there is a critical distinction to be made.  There is a mind/body dualism inherent in your language (I suspect that is why you used quotes around "roam around").  The mind cannot 'escape the confines of the brain'.  There is no deus ex machina.  No meat/mind split.  No ghost trapped in the machine.  The mind is an emergent phenomenon, entirely causally dependent on the physical substrate from which it emerges.
<br>
<br>
The brain/body may be HIGHLY upgraded (this is the 'escape' that you were probably talking about) to the point that the network pattern (wireless or wired) is highly manipulable, evolvable and transferable, but I suspect that when the pattern is copied to the computer for whatever purpose (backup, mind-upgrade simulation, etc.), there will be no need to ever destroy the original evolving physically instantiated data-set.  
<br>
<br>
If we have a constant connection to the global matrix then we already would be part of the global computer and yet we would still retain our individuality and mobility.  We wouldn't be physically stuck in some imobile data-storage facility somewhere.  This individual freedom gives us the ability to be our own local-system administrators, a freedom I would never relinquish.
<br>
<br>
To attain the freedoms that you speak of, the MASSIVE upgrade of the physical substrate itself (brain/body/environment) will be enough to create the direct neural connection to the global/local networks.  This direct connection is all that we really need to attain those freedoms through the ubiquitous giga-computers of tomorrow.

<center><p class="mindxquote"> Too big an alteration in our personality at a time by the machine will break the chain of psychological connectedness and

issue would require more detailed specification of how the advanced experience machine operates. So long as experiences are being done to
<br>
us rather than participated in by us, it is hard to make sense of the idea of a continuous personality that integrates changes in personality to
<br>
form a coherent individual across time. </p></center>
<br>
I guess the question then is how extended that transformation time should be, in order to preserve the sense of self.

I said (many years ago) How Much Does The Brain Need The Body?
<br>
<br>
I am still saying it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The brain needs to body because it needs habituation procesess, lymbic procesess and many others, but this does not answer my question. 
<br>
<br>
My question is/was, how much does the brain need the body in terms of, can an AI robot have any perticular passion for learning like ahuman and can it "want" to learn and does this re awaken our understanding towrds waht it means to be "Intelligent" and "Creative" considering we often do things because we "like" to do so, not because we are programmed to do so. There is a difference in motive. The implicatons are enourmous and it needs "cross fertilisation" of concepts to sort this one. Neuroscience  and cognitive science and the boundries that ties up how these relate from the descriptive means to the physical means. Thatt's the hard part.

<br>
<br>
But a small device, already indicated as Metabrain on the primo body design, may change the whole story, shall overturn the outcome.
<br>
<br>
Until you have a physical body, the paste of time is quite  dictated by this body. Unless you don't want to boil the river you swim in, you must go quite slow. Maybe a million times slower, than the Metabrain permits you to.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, between the two swimming moves, you may want to go on a vacations - mentally.
<br>
<br>
To swim inside some virtual river, where the paste of time is much more suitable for your speedy Metabrain. The avatar body and the strong virtuality river are also - quite much better.
<br>
<br>
So, the best idea is, to dock your primo body to some computornium. Be cause you don't want to go back - ever. From the most pleasant strong virtuality, back to the physical reality? I think not. The exchange rate for the time may also be  drastic. A year in the SV  - or a minute in a reality, as we know.
<br>
<br>
Also, the energy you are spending for a minute of a "real swimming", may holds for billions of years, of swimming over there.
<br>
<br>
Body design 2 - may not be more, than a very short passage.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Well I like to swim...no I love swimming. But I don't see how virtual swimming would be anything close to the real thing.
<br>
<br>
I free dive and love the infinite variations of the swells through the California kelp beds, prying abalone from under a ledge 40 feet down while the surge wips you back and forth and your lungs burn. Then sitting on the beach physically exhausted frying up abalone slices in a batter of porter.
<br>
<br>
I'm also a surfer and part of the beauty of surfing is catching that near-perfect wave that only comes along once in a blue-moon, making the most of the imperfect ones and dreaming of the 'perfect' wave...the one that is perfect for you. Part of it is being dragged underwater till your lungs are going to burst. Or having the power of the ocean snap your board like a toothpick, walking wearily from the waves knowing you pushed it to the edge of your abilities, and having the coral burns to prove it.
<br>
<br>
I don't want programmed perfection, nor do I want programmed imperfection. I want to face the raw, uncontrolled universe as it unfolds. I don't want to know my experience was simulated from a set of parameters I specified beforhand.
<br>
<br>
Now I'd go for bio-engineered gill-slits and green photo-synthesizing hair. I'd also go for the ability to withstand cold water without neoprene and even webbed toes. I'd go for modified corneas so as to more clearly see without a piece of glass and air-bubble plastered in front of my eyes. THOSE are changes I'd find useful for swimming.
<br>
<br>
You all lead much too sheltered lives. The universe is a dark, dangerous and incredibly wonderous place. The inside of a computer simulation is...dull, by comparison.</p></td>

If we fx remove the heart, shouldn't we then remove the connections between the heart and the brain. Will the brain adapt automatically to our "no heart-body"? Or will it still "think" that we
<br>
have a heart. My point is, that before we make radical changes to our body, I think we have to know and understand our brain alot better. And then about the heart again - What about the rush of your heart pumbing faster, and your blood flowing furisly around your veins, when you meet the girl/boy of your dreams...? I certanly don't wanna loose that feeling. Will we simulate that feeling instead? Guess one could do that - after all it's all in our heads (brain). But to  simulate that feeling ACCURATELY, one have to know
<br>
the brain very very well. The feeling is probably a little bit different from person to person, so the simulation should be induvidually adjusted. 
<br>
<br>
I don't think that these radical changes to our body will be made before we understand the brain fully - or almost fully. Each time we replace or alter something in our body, a corresponding place in the brain, have to be altered as well. Alot of feelings will have to be simulated, and I don't wanna exchange anything before those simulations are 100% accurate simulations of the real thing. When we can do that, I'm on :) And I think we will be able to do that eventually.
<br>
<br>
We might be able to replace many things in our body before we understand the brain well enough to actually do the replacement without the loss of some "feelings".</p></td>

<br>
So far the gist of what I have seems to pivot mostly on conjecture and assumption. The concerns and suppositions are mostly inspirational. My own contributions hinder around a basic tenant. The possibility that we may be able to replace "meat-being with some synthetic countersubstance is not so terribly distasteful if it brings with it greater facility and durability. The primary area of concern is in whether being integrity can be maintained. By its very definition however this is wholy not likly. The question then becomes how much of "us" is essential. Can some major version of this "us" be transferred. The commentary is quite thought provoking and apparently has been given consideration. My central question here is has any of the research, experimentation provided even the slightest hint of a genesis of these possibilities. Have we or can we show some inkling of result along these lines. For instance, there was recently an article about scientists using cranial implantation in monkeys to control cursor movement in a personal computer. Does anyone have any further actual samplings of any experiment to parallel progress in even the slightest along the lines of the "singularity" concept. To me this will serve better than all conjecture as to the feasibility of these postulations. 
<br>
                      thank you all for your

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Have any of you guys seen "Ghost In the Shell"?
<br>
Another interesting parallel is drawn in the
<br>
world of "Orion's Arm," so search for it if you
<br>
so desire. It's neat futuristic fiction that
<br>
futurecasts like Mr. Kurzweil, except much
<br>
farther into the future.
<br>
<br>
Now on to the 'mad' part of my response. &gt;:- (
<br>
<br>
I'm not so much sickened by Kurzweil's article
<br>
as I am by some of your posts.
<br>
_I_ am a person. Individuality is not a cancer,
<br>
no matter what you bloody determinists want
<br>
to believe. Whenever anyone speaks they have
<br>
bias, conjecture, and assumption, so don't
<br>
pretend that you, the "holy elite scientists"
<br>
of the web can be objective.
<br>
<br>
I like the idea of 'expanding the possibility
<br>
of carnation', instead of limiting it to
<br>
some synthetic absolute. But to me, and I think
<br>
for long after this idea of "post-humanism"
<br>
fades away, the mere idea of cyborgization and
<br>
artificiality will disgust and deter real people
<br>
from desecrating their bodies.
<br>
<br>
I have an inkling from what I read of the posts
<br>
and Mr. Kurzweil's writings, but I think it's
<br>
my duty to ask the question.
<br>
Am I to assume there are NO Christian,
<br>
non-secular, even "spiritual" people among those
<br>
participating in these discussions? I can see
<br>
the future of all that we talk about here, and
<br>
it's gathering momentum, and I don't like it.
<br>
It scares me. It won't scare the people who
<br>
I'm talking about as much as shock, because to
<br>
them it will be a blindside on an idle Tuesday-
<br>
out of nowhere. I also have other objections
<br>
to this type of subject that I either cannot
<br>
remember right now, or remember, but will
<br>
release upon request.
<br>
<br>
Okay, the 'mad' part is done. ;)
<br>
<br>
I can see the utility of life-extension via
<br>
artificial methods, and non-invasive methods
<br>
of cyborgization (such as those analogous to
<br>
wearing a watch or contact lens). I even look
<br>
forward to something like that out of
<br>
Arthur C. Clarke's "Rama Revealed" when the
<br>
people 'sleep' for 3 whole days, and are
<br>
completely restored to their physical 'state'
<br>
they were the previous year- thereby 'immortal'.
<br>
However-- I would still be aversed to it.
<br>
Take all you need in, and then when it's done,
<br>
take it out- that would be my compunction.
<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to call to attention, from a
<br>
nickelodeon (60's) I once viewed where the people
<br>
died, and had their bodies replaced with robots
<br>
and at the end the scientist eschewed them to
<br>
a back room where he administered the "final
<br>
upgrade" which allowed their immortal bodies
<br>
to reproduce, that Mr. Kurzweil didn't mention
<br>
the EVEN FURTHER separation from physical
<br>
sexuality that the upgrade from human
<br>
reproduction 1.0 would bring. The problem as I
<br>
see it: it seems an unecessary step
<br>
(keeping in line with his line of thought,
<br>
stepping aside from my aversion to the
<br>
blasphemous technology) to be born in a test
<br>
tube, artificial womb, or even fleshly womb,
<br>
if then only to be upgraded sequentially
<br>
until full upgrade is allowable at the end of
<br>
puberty.
<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think of this:
<br>
If instead the whole of the upgrade can be
<br>
transmitted to the child (such as a third
<br>
method of transmission: DNA, ribosomal DNA, and
<br>
then the nanorobot &amp; related instructions),
<br>
thus removing outside intervention altogether.
<br>
Of course, there would be necesary checks and
<br>
safeguards to make sure no errors are made
<br>
whatsoever in transcription of this third
<br>
method.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening, and please don't be
<br>
harsh, as I am new to this thread and
<br>
site.

<br>
Wow - I think James pretty much said it all :)! Let me just summarize here some things:
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it would be too hard to "upgrade the DNA". That would require of us a complete knowledge of how the DNA defines the development of a fetus into a human. But that would be very hard to understand because of the extremely high degree of non-linearity of the process. This is what will really prevent us from actually "reverse engineering" the brain.
<br>
However, this approach is the most promising in the long run (several centuries), if we want to create a Borg-like civilization.
<br>
<br>
However, in the short run we can still do something useful. Something like extending our senses seems very real even right now. I am sure that next generation Air Force pilots would be able to respond much faster to various combat situations because the computer-generated visual signals (from the Combat Center's server) could be transmited directly into the "upgraded" retina without originally coming from the eyes. I also see it in an extended application of the area of neural cryptography (see one of the recent papers by Adi Shamir) which would be quite important for national and Internet security. Helping disabled people is also very important. 
<br>
<br>
However, not all of these changes can be made on adult people. Here is why:
<br>
It is a well known fact that babies when born see things upside down and have to adapt their whole motor response to the environment. The whole process stops only when the body reaches puberty. It is also well known that if you artificially cover the eyes of a newborn and leave it like that until he reaches puberty, he will stay blind forever. All that exemplifies a very deep process that's going on inside our brains during childhood. This means the brain's neural netorks are in a "training mode" during this time and are very sensitive to any sensory input. More precisely, they are in the process of defining actually what *is* sensory input and starting to build their higher structures of thought. In my opinion, this is exactly the right time to "upgrade" those structures.
<br>
<br>
It must be noted, however, that removing any organs is a highly risky idea. The problem is, again, the non-linearity of it all. Removing an organ may affect another part of the body. Unfortuantely, I don't have a lot of information about this, but even from what I know the idea sounds suicidal. So if we want to go along this route we might as well just find a way of upgrading our DNA (which James already noted).
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and last: if we want to become linked to the Internet thru our brains (Not to mention making IPv6 and SSL work in the brain!), what about the possibility of someone hacking us? Imagine yourself in an official setting when suddenly you start getting an orgasm :)!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>And last thing (truly last!): there's been a lot of talking about downloading/linking of "virtual personas". As a student of cognition, I know some stuff about the brain and to me the idea sounds silly if not outright dangerous. Here is why:
<br>
<br>
Suppose every neural cell of the brain was upgraded with nano-elements or whatever. Now, the brain gains the ability to download a completely modified persona, since every axon's and dendron's signal is modified in a programmed way to accomplish the change. When the whole thing "turns on" the person... dies. Here is why: the unique neural pathways that were in this person's brain and allowed him to regulate his bodily natural rhythms and organs became no more.
<br>
<br>
Again, as somebody said: the "mind" is an integral part of the body and you cannot separate it.
<br>
<br>
And in any case, the whole idea is a baloney, because every person's neural network is uniquely expressed not only by its internal connections but also in the actual cells. So, guys, I think we lost ourselves in all those virtual concepts of "virtuality". It's time to get back to reality (however sad and painful it may be :( ).</p></td>

It won't scare the people who I'm talking about as much as shock, because to them it will be a blindside on an idle Tuesday- out of nowhere.  </p></center>

I'm willing to bet a few Romans felt the same way.
<br>
<br>
Is the singularity a religion? absolutly..one that will become much like every other religion and completely different at the same time.
<br>
<br>
religion is the following of ideas. those ideas are shared between its members and believed to their very "soul", much like a collective.  
<br>
<br>
if you look above religion and see it as a collective and not  "the word of god", you will see that they all start, live, then die, replaced by the next religion. chistianity will die, replaced by the next (islam? who knows 8)...). just as the egyptians and other "pagan" religions. It will die for the same reasons, its impracticalities. the fundamentals will not change. and they never have. but the details will fit the time in which they are presant.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">  your  deterministic view of the future for humans is likened much to that of the Borg, from Star Trek? Except perhaps even morso 
<br>
'advanced' in the realm of conformity? 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
the collective portrayed by star trek is unfortunatly one of the strongest representations of a humaniod distributed consciousness the general pubic has ever seen. It is also one that is so incomplete and illogical that I believe that it is an imposible future that should not be used as a reference. Here's why:
<br>
<br>
1. heavy cybernetic implantation - this plays on the fears of an industrialisation mind set, the idea that the body is augmented and added to for better abilities with mechanical and electrical robotic parts.  with the advances in nanotechnology and miniturization in general, such "bulky" implants would be ineffecient and error prone for "assimilation" techniques, and any other real world function for that matter. Plus, such implants are inherintly ugly.  this would be a dead stop in a world previously obsessed with physicall image such as our own world. It created the image that was needed for plot. It did its job but it should not be a basis for a close posibility.
<br>
<br>
2. no emotion - emotion is touchy subject in itself here at kurzweilAI, but its role in human society cannot be removed. It SHOULD not be removed, even if we discover we can and still live without it.
<br>
  If a collective starts with experiences of individuals, then the ideas and emotions of those individuals would be incorporated into the collective (equally?). So would every mind added to the collective from there on, each adding what makes them different from others.  Humans are much too diverse for their emotions to disappear in such a way. if their emotions and thoughts are not added to the collective, then it is no longer a collective. in taking over the body, it would get rid of whatever mind lived there before, one mind, no input from the previous mind. No one with any self preservation would allow that to happen to them. their mind would cese to exist and the body would be just a shell to manipulate. Its much more effecient and logical to kill the person and recycle them for their minerals. any information that may be usefull would probably be easily removed before liquification. 
<br>
<br>
3. "Resistance is futile." resistance is a fundamental of nuture. its called friction. its hardly futile for any object, living or artificial. Assimilation is futile,  if an advanced being of collective intellegence followed any logic, it would be very conscious of the cost of energy consuption.  the energy lost in trapping alive and assimilating a non-standard physical object and maintaining that bodies particular needs would be far higher than extracting needed resources directly from that body to grow standard "drones".
<br>
<br>
<br>
with  "expanding the possibility of carnation", you also expand the diversity within a speices. there will be some that join together to form a collective. There will be others that augment themselves but stay quite individualistic. there probably be a vast gradient of people between the two. and more than likely there will be a number of people who deside to remain "human".  there are 6 (7?) billion people on this planet now and none of them are the same. they will(should) all be given the opertunity to choose their future and it is garanteed they will not all choose the same path.
<br>
<br>
We will have to expect variations of all of these. And, as it should be now, we will have to respect the individuals' path, though it may be contrary to our own. If any of you consider yourselves intellegent, please never loose sight of that.
<br>
<br>
how/when/why did other speices split along their evolution? would the singularity be a point when the human speices spilts? would we be able to coexist with our other forms? not imposible since other creatures still coexist with each other now.
<br>
<br>
and how will all these advances effect the other creatures that live on this planet? or the planet(environment) for that matter?
<br>
<br>
think of the posibilities. for they are all posible.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I don't think you understand fully the intimate descriptions and implications and what most call "technobabble" that the Star Trek shows have made for the Borg. However, this isn't a Star Trek
<br>
forum, and even I don't often read the books on
<br>
Star Trek (I'm sure there's people who know
<br>
even more about the borg than I do, if that's
<br>
possible).
<br>
<br>
Yet again, the singularity situations I think
<br>
are thought out (if not well), check out that
<br>
website called Orion's Arm. There's one that
<br>
is a comic or whatever. That's not it.
<br>
The one I'm talking about it says "space opera"
<br>
on the page as well. Hope that helps. Good
<br>
fiction on singularity, and points out the
<br>
immensely revolting things that I fear will
<br>
happen. Such as "upgrade of be denied immortality" , "destructive brain scans" , mass conformity to "AI Gods," which I think is particularly distateful for the site to use a capital 'G', since not one of the AI's is described to be able to 'talk' to God.
<br>
<br>
As for the guy who said religions will all die,
<br>
this is untrue. Science is a religion, and it
<br>
will never die- might change, but still. Science believes that nothing can be proven, only ratified and accepted- which is rubbish.
<br>
<br>
Once we get nano, fempto, atto, and pico technology capabilities, I am expecting we will discover abilities that will circumvent all these idiots who always think about the laws of thermodynamics as "proven," (quite hypocritical), we will be able to recycle energy into matter by recollecting it and recoursing it to higher frequencies and wavelengths. Engineers think (the new generation) that perfection CAN be found, and continuum modelling will eventually be extended into at least two other dimensions (such as with the computers that simulate object design), and then we will have EXTREMELY efficient and precise systems that are as impermiable as the Universe seems to us now.
<br>
<br>
Speaking of energy, I would like to know if anybody knows of Joseph Newman? Check out his Energy Machine, but don't let reputation make a bias for you. Supposedly it converts matter into energy electrically. I recently read an article from Google about a scientist thinking that the mass in matter gets converted to gravitational energy, trying to say also that time-space was involved. I'd also like to hear about any input on this subject. I think gravity must be a property of the universe (lowercase 'u') passing through hyperspace, you know, relativity, UNLESS they can find the higgs particle, i.e. the somewhat poorly named "god particle".

only be our DNA. The nanobots and subsidiary
<br>
secondary characteristics (perhaps programmed
<br>
similar to puberty) using the latest unit
<br>
of length (nano, fempto, pico, atto, etc) as
<br>
the most precise (though at that point the
<br>
whole human body seems a waste of energy to
<br>
perpetuate, to some) placing and fabrication of
<br>
these new technologies, would be simply bionic
<br>
additions...
<br>
Now, the END-result that Mr. Kurzweil is
<br>
describing, however tested, retested, and treekled
<br>
into mainstream it becomes, will in any event
<br>
lead to this 'singularity' of posthuman
<br>
nonsense. I think this will happen more
<br>
exponentially than gradually, but the future is
<br>
ours.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Interesting article, but I think it shows some lack of imagination or bravery (or perhaps just wise discretion) in some sensitive areas. Particularly the idea that we will continue to want to eat and have sex for the pleasure of these activities is either naive or perhaps intentional downplaying of something that may be controversial. 
<br>
<br>
I find it absurd to think that when we have such a complete and powerful understanding of our natural systems that we won't have a concurrently complete and powerful understanding of how to induce levels of pleasure that are millions of times more satisfying than these two currently very pleasurable activities produce. 
<br>
<br>
And I think humans-v2 will very quickly realize that the "communication" function of sexuality can be reproduced (pardon the pun) in other ways that are also millions of times more satisfying as well millions of times more information-rich. 
<br>
<br>
So, forget the mouth, esophagus, and genitals part. If the original designers don't have the, um, guts to go that far, certainly the v2 humans will go there very swiftly.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The Kurzweil article is defintely a clear understand of the basic idea of human improvement. But I would like to push the idea to the extreme consequences.
<br>
<br>
Once you start to improve the body is very easy to get a picture where only a catastrophic accident may kill someone. But this type of accident may become quite probable for individuals that may last for thousand of year, if they live on a planet surface.
<br>
<br>
So the scenario would picture individuals that will improve as fast as they can to live on the most stable objects of our Universe.
<br>
<br>
These objects, generally speaking, may be identified on the most massive objects of our Universe that not have an event horizon, i.e. are not black holes.
<br>
<br>
I don't know at this time (someone know?) if massive objects like neutron stars may coherently store and process informations, but my guess is that would definitely be the safest place to stay in the currect shape of the Universe.
<br>
<br>
So, probably, after a phase of biological improvement, human V3 will probably imbedded in bodies that would use the basic principle of our Universe to let our program to safely run and to survive the even the more catastrophic events that our Universe may experiment. All the other things we need to interact and enjoy the life may the "virtualized" for us ... we don't need a phisical body for these type of things.
<br>
<br>
I hope I expressed my idea beside my poor english (I'm not a native speaker). Regards.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It&#8217;s hard to digest a lot of this because it&#8217;s almost an assumption based on these writings that technology (as a human platform) will be the next evolutionary path.
<br>
<br>
The first thing I question about collectives is motivation. How do you know that this is a desirable future? It&#8217;s so far from reality, unless you are basing this idea on studies of real-world models such as ant or termite colonies (which is the closest I can think of right now).
<br>
<br>
Why is this better path for the future? For me to take such an artificial path into the future, I would need to understand better what happens to me after death. There may be a real &#8220;collective&#8221; that you progress to, and by becoming confined to this artificial collective, you may forfeit the natural progression that billions of years have established. Creating this alternative future, seems a bit overzealous to me.
<br>
<br>
I see merit with many of the things talked about here, and I definitely see it as inevitable. I will be akin to the arms race as the first primitive &#8220;brain upgrades&#8221; occur, this will spark the next evolution as governments and economies rush to stay competitive with the &#8220;super thinkers&#8221; and the &#8220;super agile&#8221;. My question is though, if it is inevitable that we evolve in this manor (by our own hand), why would we CHOOSE to evolve with synthetic materials? 
<br>
<br>
In a perfect scenario, we would understand intimately the biological machines that we are and evolve that platform keeping our dependency on machines a non-reality. Perhaps we do use nano-tech to alter our organs and DNA to support this vision, but to rid us of our biological selves and become slaves (or at least totally dependant) to technology seems a little shortsighted. To say that we will never understand DNA enough to achieve this seems farcical in light of the other technology futures discussed here.
<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that we are so new to this type of thinking. How long have we even considered altering our future in this way? I dare say our generation is the first to really consider plausible futures with humans being their own &#8220;God&#8221; and being the guiding hand to their own evolution. I am far from convinced that anyone of these &#8220;ultimate human destinations&#8221; is either real or desirable. Whether or not everyone &#8220;has a choice&#8221;, humans in general are very impressionable (think Branch Davidians) and easy to manipulate and there will NO DOUBT be those who jump on the &#8220;collective bandwagon&#8221;. 
<br>
<br>
While I see extending our physical lives here as desirable, I have to question a permanent stay. At some point we will want to move on to the next step (whatever it may be). One of the best movie quotes ever I think was from the movie Contact (Sagan), where the religious character was questioning Jody Foster&#8217;s character about her quest and its implications on mankind. Not sure what the actual verbiage was but essentially he asked:
<br>
<br>
&#8220;Will all this make us happier?&#8221;
<br>
<br>
All these visions of the future are tainted by one bit of programming that is embedded in our DNA: Survival of our genes and their physical manifestation on this planet. Is it acceptable to say that we can dictate what is our ultimate future when our vision is clouded with this programming? 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps we should engineer out this element so we can clearly see what is real and accept our existence in more Zen fashion. I feel this conversation is premature and most people who are predicting the ultimate destination on earth based on artificial technology will one day be discussed like those who thought the world was flat.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote"> In a perfect scenario, we would understand intimately the biological machines that we are and evolve that platform keeping our dependency on machines a non-reality. Perhaps we do use nano-tech to alter our organs and DNA to support this vision, but to rid us of our biological selves and become slaves (or at least totally dependant) to technology seems a little shortsighted. To say that we will never understand DNA enough to achieve this seems farcical in light of the other technology futures discussed here. </p></center> I had once wrote a fiction about a creature that could assimilate DNA and teleport. Wouldn't that be interesting?
<br>
<br>
I agree with you about the DNA. People would not all want to replace their body organs. They would rather want to improve on what they already had. These would still be called 'human', but would use some robotic add-ons to their systems.
<br>
<br>
Then there would be the neospecies that replaced system order/structure. They would not build on the human body so much as they would revolutionize it.
<br>
<br>
The ones that revolutionized would 'win'???
<br>
<br>
A DNAAUC (DNA Auto Upgrade Computer) would be an internal organ that progressively inhanced genetic codes. =)
<br>
<br>
Would all of these neohuman species fight over each other and try to dominate each other once one became superior, or would they unite and progress as a team? Fighting is very stupid compared to working as a time. True intelligence improvements would bring increadable peace. Pleasure seekers would not need to take away from others, they would simply drug themselves with superpleasure products.
<br>
<br>
Once old age was cured religion would start to die out, because of the desire for an afterlife being such a central part of religion.

Don't use wireless body communications -- Use an internal communication wire matrix. Another healthy aulternative is hardware firewalls with un-crackable, massive security codes!

DO NOT HOOK UP NANOBOTS TO THE INTERNET!

If our entire brain did hook to the internet, that would be a danger, but people would not want to put themselves in danger so many would chose not to hook their brains to the internet... but others would.

Your personality and all cognitive processes develop from your environment and the way your life has progressed, or at least that's the way I understand it.  If all of our memories and experiences were stored in a computer brain, I believe we would still be ourselves, and passing huge amounts of collective information along to younger generations would allow for much faster progression in knowledge, assuming of course that the new "brains" would be able to create new connections and store massive amounts of new information.  The concept of the collective existence reminds me of the "Buggers" from Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game,' in which a Hive Queen controls all of the members of her hive as if they were merely limbs.  Having a collective consciousness seems to me to be merely the concept of someone who is afraid of the sci-fi direction scientic reality is taking.  An afterlife, or collective consciousness after death as stated in a previous post appears to me as being a completely irrational, bordering on ludicrous thought.  Cyborganization would be an incredibly useful process, as with longer lifespans, increased intelligenge, and overall healthier bodies (as if that wasn't enough) would allow us to explore beyond our current limitations.  Most if not all of the ideas brought up by Kurzweil are feasible in the near future.  This article has excited me greatly, because I can imagine only a very few of the possibilities these innovations would open up to mankind, yet I know there are many more that are just beyond my grasp.

The one idea I really don't like is the body's connection to the Internet.  As stated in other posts, I would fear viruses and hackers that could make some part of the system malfunction, causing damage or even 'killing' the being.  Possibly an integrated access to the internet, where you can choose to plug yourself in to a portable device to access the internet, which would limit the time in which you could have these problems to when you choose to be connected.  Otherwise, advancing our current technologies and keeping them completely seperate from the bodies would be an option without the fear of damage or death instilled by access between the computers inside your body and those outside of it.</p></td>

If you created a back up copy of yourself before you logged onto the internet, and if you were killed, the backup copy would then be used to recreate you and you would loose only a few hours of your life [if you made a backup before you logged on].
<br>
<br>
Security could, infact, become super advanced. One fine idea is this: We would have direct-connect to our loved ones over the internet, but perhaps never use the internet for anything other then connecting to/sharing our security codes with only people that we already knew personally. This would be most cautious.

<br>
<br>
Everything I have read here so far is a very nice fantasy in my opinion. Because I bring up one thing. If we would be able to store Memories emotions morols and intellegence into anouther vessle. What stops the consept of Senthetic memories? How would you know if you were the one who did the acts in the first place or even in fact if the very life you live was your own? To be mortal is to be human. Thats the whole point of life is the fact that you cannot press the reset button. Lets say some one went threw something terrible for instence a woman was rapped. They would be able to delete that whole memorie from her data base. Which would be rather nice. Causing the emotional damage to stop and alow her to live her life again. Like with criminles instead of sending them to jail you would just be able to alter there behavor untill there just anouther outstanding member of the community. i see the good points in this project i really do. But with a life stored on the interenet. You could pretty much do or be whom ever you want. instead of going out and living life. You would download it. The richness in life is not the end result of the equation. but the path you walked to get to there. </p></td>
