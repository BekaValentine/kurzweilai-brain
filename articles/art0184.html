<div class="TeaserText">In this keynote given at the 8th Annual Foresight Conference, Raymond Kurzweil discusses exponential trends in various technologies, and the double-edged sword accelerating technologies represent.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally presented November 2000. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2001.</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to be here. I speak quite a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. It's enjoyable to speak to a group that actually understands something about the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and believes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>I want to start off by sharing some views about the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends. I was talking with Rob Freitas about his very compelling book, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a>, which I think will emerge ultimately as a classic book, much like Drexler's book, establishing some of the foundation for the feasibility of an important technological concept. A lot of the scenarios that I talk about are dependent on the marriage of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s which Rob Freitas has explored.</p>
<p>As Rob and I were talking, he, <a class="thought" href="entries/hall_entry.html">J. Storrs Hall</a>, and Ralph Merkle were chiding me for the conversation I had with <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> in a bar in Lake Tahoe, which, I guess, started Bill on a course that he's still on. And I do want to address the issues that <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> has raised.</p>
<p>Another person at that bar room conversation was <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a>, the philosopher. I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, actually, that some of the interactions I had with John would end up being more controversial. But, not as many people are interested in the controversy about <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Although I'll touch on that as well, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, and whether <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is limited to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> and I are very often paired as the pessimistic/optimistic respectively, and I do take issue with <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s conclusions. Particularly, I feel that his prescription for relinquishing broad areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is unrealistic, unfeasible, not desirable, and basically totalitarian.</p>
<p>But, if there's more than just Bill and I on a panel, I very often end up defending Bill on the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> feasibility of the scenarios that he describes. The panel rarely gets beyond that point once somebody attacks the feasibility of the kinds of technological capabilities that Bill describes and worries about.</p>
<p>We were on a panel at Harvard a few weeks ago, and a Nobel Prize winning molecular scientist said, "Oh, we're not going to see <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s for a hundred years. So, therefore, these scenarios are nothing to be concerned about."</p>
<p>I said, "Actually, that's not a bad estimate, with the amount of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> that we need to make to achieve that particular technological milestone at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>." But, we are accelerating the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and, in fact, a lot of people are quick to agree to that. This is something that I've studied now for the last 20 years. And I can show you a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> about that.</p>
<p>According to my models, we're actually doubling the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>, or the rate of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, every decade. So, we'll see a hundred years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the next 20 or 25 years. Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is so explosive, particularly when you get to the <a class="thought" href="entries/knee_of_the_curve_entry.html">knee of the curve</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s start out flat and stay about zero for a very long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, which is why nobody notices them. Then suddenly, they flow seemingly out of nowhere and get very powerful. And we're now entering that <a class="thought" href="entries/knee_of_the_curve_entry.html">knee of the curve</a>. This field of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is one example of that. But, there's a whole confluence of revolutions all of which are governed by what I call The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> and exponential acceleration.</p>
<p>The very rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> itself is an example of this law. If you figure out the implications of doubling the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> every decade, you'll see that we will experience 20,000 years of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, not a 100 years worth of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. And that makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>A lot of people are quick to agree, "Oh, yeah, things are accelerating," but relatively few serious observers or commentators about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> really truly internalize the implications of this. Otherwise <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful people will very often say, "Oh, that's going to take a 100 years." Or, "We won't see that for 300 years." This is not the conception of how much change we'll see in those kinds of timeframes if you accept the exponential rate of change. But, if you have a linear view of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>--and I call that the <a class="thought" href="entries/intuitive_linear_view_entry.html">intuitive linear view</a>--then things look very different.</p>
<p>In centuries past, people didn't even accept the fact that things were changing because things for them had been pretty much like their parents, and things in the present were very much like the past. And they expected the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to be the same. Today, it's generally accepted that things are changing, that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is driving change. But, very few people really internalize the implications of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>.</p>
<p>We really only saw 25 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the 20<sup>th</sup> century because we've been accelerating up to this point. The 21<sup>st</sup> century will be almost a thousand times greater in technical change. Of course, the 20<sup>th</sup> century was pretty dramatic as it is.</p>
<p>I want to share with you what I've explored in terms of technical change in different fields, some of which bears on the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. I see this area of investigation as a less than sharply defined field, and more the inevitable end result of another pervasive <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>, which is the trend toward <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, which also goes back hundreds of years; but again, people didn't notice it because it was so slow. Now it's reaching the <a class="thought" href="entries/knee_of_the_curve_entry.html">knee of the curve</a> in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> and making things smaller. We're currently shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> at a rate of 5.6 per linear dimension per decade--pretty much the same figure in both <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>And that gets us to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> ranges, which are not very well defined. I mean, how many nano meters is still considered <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>? But, the speed at which <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is shrinking gets us there within a couple of decades, two or three decades, depending on where you draw the line. And that's another <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why the <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> of broad areas like <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s prescription, is utterly unfeasible, or unrealistic, because it's really not one field; it's really the end result of thousands of very diverse projects which are incrementally making things a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> smaller, at a very gradual and continuous rate.</p>
<p>I'd like to explore some of those trends with you, and then put them together in some scenarios and discuss the kinds of impact this will have, because I see it as very pervasive. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> is getting more and more intimate. It's already expanding the reach and capability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. And, ultimately, I think we'll expand the capabilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings themselves. By the end of the century, I don't think there will be a clear distinction between you and a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>Most people today have a concept of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> as something much more brittle, much less subtle, much less <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al or capable than <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. But, that's because the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s we interact with are still on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a million times simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body. But, that won't remain the case, particularly as we succeed in <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>; and, we're well along that path. I'll talk a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> about that, later.</p>
<p>So, as we combine this field of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> with some of the other very powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s, it will change the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of most things, including what it means to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. This exploration really started by my reflecting on <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. And very often when I speak, particularly to educated lay audiences, I'll ask how many people have heard of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. Even in non-technical audiences, I've stopped doing that, because pretty much everybody has heard of it.</p>
<p>But, four or five years ago, even in the technical audiences, only a scattering of hands would go up. So, there's certainly been increasing recognition of that trend. But, that trend is not the only <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>. I began to think, "Why is <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> growing exponentially?" I mean, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> literally means the shrinking of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, so it is an example of <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>. It's actually approximately every 24 months that there are twice as many <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>. That results in a quadrupling of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power, because you can put twice as many on the <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, and they run twice as fast because the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s have less distance to travel. This has been going on since <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s were first introduced.</p>
<p>Is this a special field? Why do we have <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s? Is there something more profound going on? Or, is it, as Randy Isaac said, "...just a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of industry expectations now. We're kind of used to it, so we know what we need to target two years out, four years out, in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to remain competitive and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."</p>
<p>This actually becomes quite significant and relevant in terms of the question of whether <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in computing will outlive <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. Because increasingly, it's being recognized that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, as a specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, is going to run out of steam in somewhere between 10 and 18 years. And now there is the consensus that by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the key features will be some <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able number of atoms and then, they wouldn't be able to shrink them anymore. The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> conclusion is, okay, that will be it.</p>
<p>So, I began to think about this, and have been <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about this for 20 years. The book I wrote in 1990, <i>The </i><a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a>, reflected on some of those implications. The first thing I realized is that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> was not the first, but actually the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in computing. I know these charts are kind of small; you don't really have to see the details. They all kind of go like this. (Laughter, as Ray mimics <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>)</p>
<p>This goes back to the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. I put 49 famous <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on a graph--and this is an exponential graph. Most of the charts I'll show you are exponential graphs, where a straight line means <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. This chart goes back to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that were used in the 1890 census, which was the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> processing equipment was used in a census.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231828im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart03.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>I've since then put a lot more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on this chart. It just fills it in, but it's the same trend. The first thing you notice is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing didn't start with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. It goes back a hundred years. Also, that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> is the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. And, every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> one <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> ran out of steam, another <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> was ready to pick up the pace. We had relay-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s say in 1940, with the <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> which cracked the German's enigma <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. It created a real dilemma for Winston Churchill because he got the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about which cities were to be bombed. He was told, for example, that Coventry was to be bombed, and he refused to warn them, because that would have tipped off the Germans that their seemingly impregnable <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> had been cracked.</p>
<p>Next, there was the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, like the one that predicted the election of Eisenhower. <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> used <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> based <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the 1960's in the first <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> launches; I think they still use them. And there, at the upper right, is the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> you just bought your nephew for Christmas.</p>
<p>Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> ran out of steam, another one stepped in. They were making <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s smaller. They finally couldn't make them any smaller and still keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>. And then <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s came along, which had already been in development. <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">Transistor</a>s are not just small <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s; it's a completely different approach.</p>
<p>It's clear to me, and I'm sure to many of you, where the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> will come in. It will come from molecular computing. We live in a three dimensional world. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> uses a very bulky, inefficient form of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing--I mean, it's a different <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> than the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s we're used to; it is electro-chemical, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> control <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>, it's not simply parallel, and they're very bulky structures. Most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> has to do with maintaining their <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> processes.</p>
<p>They're very slow. The reset <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is typically on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of five milliseconds, so they can do maybe 200 calculations per second in a neural connection, which is where most of the processing takes place. But, they're organized massively parallel in three dimensions. They get their very prodigious powers from that organization. We have about a hundred billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, about a thousand connections from one <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to another, so it's a hundred trillion connections, a hundred trillion fold parallelism. And multiplied by typically 200 calculations per second, it's 20 million billion calculations per second or 20 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPs</a>.</p>
<p>And that's conservatively high. We're beginning to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er some portions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and there's been some very impressive work done in the auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. We are starting to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s. And, we're able to replicate them with far fewer computes than that theoretical calculation would imply.</p>
<p>By putting things in three dimensions we can keep that trend going actually well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. And there are quite a few very interesting three dimensional computing technologies being explored. </p>
<p>We were talking last night about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>. We have some challenges, but we do know how to do computing with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, and small electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s have been created using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>. They're very strong, as you know. If we could build them in three dimensional lattices, they could have structural properties and computing properties. And if you figure out the theoretical potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, a one inch cube would have at least a million times the processing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. There are at least a dozen different molecular computing initiatives. And I hear about new ones on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But, back to the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing. Generally, as one <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> died, the other <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s were already being experimented with. There were many competing projects. And it's when the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of one <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> ran out of steam that the other one took over and was able to continue the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that this is not a straight line in this chart; it's another exponential. I have a mathematical model of why that takes place. All of these trends actually have double exponentials. The first exponential, in general terms, occurs because we get more and more powerful tools from one generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> which enables us to create the next generation more quickly, and with greater capability. We've had <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> problems in the exponential domains. We don't try to add things lineally; we try to make things twice as powerful. We try to increase things by a multiple.</p>
<p>The second increment really comes from the slowly exponentially growing resources for a particular type of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. And since we are in early stages of this field, you can see that already, the resources for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and for shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are growing exponentially. They have been for computing as well, which is why you see that slow second exponent there. We doubled the computing power every three years at the beginning of the century, every two years in the middle of the century. We're now doubling it--Well, actually, two or three years ago it was every year; it's now down to maybe every 11 months that we are doubling computing power.</p>
<p>We are increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> exponentially in many different fields. It's not limited to computing power. It's an inherent property of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> is an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process, and an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process grows exponentially. We certainly saw that in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. As I'll show you at the end, there is a very clear indication that technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is a continuation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> process that created the first <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in the first place.</p>
<p>This chart shows <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning via resolution, which has been growing exponentially. There's already <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that can see inter-<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al features with very high resolution, provided the scanning tip is near the tissues being scanned. Later, I'll talk about a way in which we can combine <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, using some of the principles that Rob Freitas has talked about, to scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from inside, which is how we ultimately will get a full <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>.<br>

<p>This chart shows <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> sequencing: When the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">Genome</a> Project was first announced 15 years ago it was considered a fringe project. There were many critics who pointed out that at the rate we could scan a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, it would take 10,000 years to finish the project, but it actually finished a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> ahead of schedule.<br>

<p>And the speed has been growing exponentially. The <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> is well known. And this is not just a manifestation of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>; this has to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in other technologies other than packing more <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>.

<p>And here, as I'm getting enough points on these graphs, you can actually see the stack S curves. People very often challenge me and say, "Well, <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> can't go on forever," like rabbits in Australia; they eventually hit a wall because they run out of resources; they can't grow exponentially anymore. And that is true for any particular <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. Like rabbits in Australia, they grow exponentially for a while, but in such small numbers you don't notice it. Then there's an explosion where <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> really takes off. And then they hit a wall and you get this sort of stretched out S curve, which is called a Sigmoid. But, its a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>, shifting to some other <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> innovation, that keeps the law of accelerating the trends and the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> going on.</p>
<p>If you get enough points on the graph you can actually see these stacked up S codes. I'm getting an update now in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al realm to actually see these small S curves every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we've had a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>. And here you can see that in this chart of ISP cost performance.<br>

</p>
<p>This is an interesting one because when I was writing <i>The </i><a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a> in the late 1980s, I felt we would see an explosion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> around the mid-1990s. This was very clear to me because I could see that the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> was developing quite predictably.</p>
<p>These trends are predictable in the exponential domain. But, we don't experience <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in the exponential domain; we experience it in the linear domain. This is how people have experienced the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. When the numbers are 10,000 doubling to 20,000 doubling to 40,000, scientists and the general public don't notice it. But, when it gets to 40 million or 80 million people, then it becomes quite noticeable. Seemingly, out of nowhere, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> exploded in the mid-1990s, but it was quite predictable from the exponential chart.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">Wireless</a>--same thing. <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> is a different manifestation of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, although, actually magnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> storage is different; that's more of a material <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. But that's also been growing exponentially.</p>
<p>If you take the model and project it out through the 21<sup>st</sup> century in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, current <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is currently somewhere between an <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> and a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, but not as well organized as an <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> or a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and not very good at <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. But, we are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> some of the chaotic processes that <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian brains use for <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. That's actually my field. The highly parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s--and actually <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s--will be ideal for that. In theory, you can do anything in a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> domain that you can do in the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> domain because you can simulate <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> processes to any desired level of accuracy.</p>
<p>But, it takes a lot more <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s by a factor of maybe a thousand. It takes thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s to do a multiply. <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a>ly, you can do an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> multiply, in theory, with just a couple <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. Maybe you need some to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> it up. But, it's an <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a thousand fewer <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s for <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> processes. Particularly for things like <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>-nets and self organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>ing, it is a very good and efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering tradeoff, which is what <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> arrived at in the design of <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian brains.</p>
<p>We'll get to at least the raw capacity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> by around 2020. By 2050, a thousand dollars of computing will equal all <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. That might be off by a couple of years. But, the 21<sup>st</sup> century won't be wanting for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources. And I'll show you a few implications outside of pure technologies.</p>
<p>Our economy is driven by the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. It's been growing exponentially as well. I mean, Republican, Democrats, recessions, you almost don't see these trends. The economy just grows exponentially. The events that you can actually notice on this chart are the depression and then the post-World War II reconstruction.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231828im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart24.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This chart is on a linear scale, and you can see a little more clearly the recessions; but they're relatively a minor cycle built on basically an <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. And it's also true on a per capita basis, so this is not a function of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> and population.</p>
<p>And it's also double exponential. The <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> rate itself has been growing exponentially. It's been very clear for the last 10 years. The models that are used, which I've looked at in some detail, by the Fed and by other policymakers, have all of these old economy factors of labor, capital investment, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> prices, and don't model at all things like <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPs</a>, megabytes and <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, intellectual property, all of which are growing exponentially. And all of which are increasingly driving the economy. But, I won't get further into that.</p>
<p>And, it affects <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. We've been eliminating jobs at the bottom of the skill ladder for 200 years through automation increasing and aiding new jobs at the top of the skill ladder. The skill ladder has been moving up, and we've been growing. This chart shows that there has been <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> at an exponential rate in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> in constant dollars and per capita.</p>
<p>Even <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> longevity has been growing exponentially. In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, we added a few days to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy every year. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century we added a few weeks every year. We're now adding about 120 days every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy. And there's a consensus, at least among some of us, that within 10 years, from the revolutions in <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> and podiomics, national drug design, cloning, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> capabilities, we'll be adding more than a year every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy.</p>
<p>So, if you can hang in there a little while longer, you actually will get to see how dramatic the 21<sup>st</sup> century will be.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">Miniaturization</a>: a trend that is quite relevant to this conference. We've been shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. These are exponential charts of elecronic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, private <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and private mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. This is why I don't see <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> as just one sharply defined field--as if Drexler defined these capabilities, and now this field is only of building Drexlerian <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231828im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart18.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>We're really getting there through this pervasive, and actually very old trend. But a trend again that starts out very slowly, and then flows exponentially into smaller and smaller realms. And will ultimately get to Drexlerian type <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but not because we're building them directly, but because that's the inevitable end result of this pervasive trend toward <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>. What Drexler showed was the feasibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> at those scales. I don't believe we'll actually stop at nanoscales, either.</p>
<p>And finally, I talked about the intuitive-linear perspective of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> versus the <a class="thought" href="entries/historical_exponential_view_entry.html">historical exponential view</a>. It's just remarkable to me how many otherwise <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful scientists and observers and would-be prognosticators just assume a linear view of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and assume that things will carry on at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, even though they've been around long enough to see that the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> today is much faster than it was 10 years ago.</p>

</p>
<p>This is a particularly interesting chart, because it's a double exponential. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>, which was the creation of primitive cells, was shortly after that the first stages of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. It took billions of years. Then, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> Explosion, things moved a lot faster and the various body plans were devised in only tens of millions of years. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s came around, <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s were down to tens of millions of years, and for primates, millions of years. Home sapiens evolved in hundreds of thousands of years. And at that point, the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to create more and more intelligent processes, really shifted from <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by the first <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Actually, there were a few such <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, but there was only room for one surviving <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in that ecological niche.<br>

</p>
<p>The first <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> took tens of thousands of years--stone tools, fire, the wheel. A thousand years ago, a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> only took a few hundred years. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, more was accomplished than in the previous eight centuries. During the first 20 years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, we accomplished more than the entire 19<sup>th</sup> century. Today a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> only takes a few years <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The worldwide web didn't exist 10 years ago; it really exploded in 1993, 1994. I first heard of it in 1994.</p>
<p>Sometimes people look at the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> behind this chart and say, "Well, wait a second, this particular body plan didn't take 10 million years; that took 40 million years. And the web wasn't seven years; that went back to the Arpanet and that was 15 years. But, this doesn't change the data; you still get a straight line. The <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> Explosion didn't take place in 10 years. And the web didn't take 50 million years.</p>
<p>The acceleration of these <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary processes and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> as a continuation of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by other means is a very powerful, inexorable trend.</p>
<p>Let's now talk about what some of the implications of putting these trends together are. I think by the end of this decade, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as we know them will disappear. And that's one of the steps along the way in <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>. We'll have images written on our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s by our eyeglasses. These are all technologies you can see today. They're not ready for prime <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. But, we'll walk around with images written to our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> from our eyeglasses and contact lenses. We'll have very high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> connection to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> at all times, <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly. The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s for all of that and all the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> will be so tiny they'll be in your eyeglasses, woven in your clothing. You won't be carrying around even palm pilot <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.</p>
<p>Computing will disappear into the environment. It won't be inside our bodies yet for most people, but it will be very close and intimate. Going to a website will mean entering a shared <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment, at least encompassing the visual and auditory senses. So, for a meeting such as this, or just when getting together with someone else, you can be in a shared <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment, which might overlay real reality, or it might replace real reality, at least for the visual and auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>.</p>
<p>And increasingly, going to a website will mean choosing some <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment that may have some different properties than real reality.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> becomes particularly interesting as we go inside the body. We've already started that process. We actually are using <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s throughout our bodies; virtually every <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has some early stages of the use of artificial technologies. Particularly the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>--I have a friend who is profoundly deaf, but I can actually talk to him on the phone now because of an implant. There has been a dramatic demonstration by a French doctor, Dr. Benebid, a few years ago. Parkinson's patients were wheeled into a room. The doctor could turn implanted <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s on and off from outside by radio control. When he had the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> turned off, and they were in a very rigid state common in advanced Parkinson patients. When he turned the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> on, and they seemingly came alive, with these implants replacing the function of the particular cells that had been destroyed.</p>
<p>We're increasingly using early stages of neuroimplants. And finding, in fact, that we can model and replace and simulate what specific <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> areas do.</p>
<p>Sometimes people question whether or not it's really feasible to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. I think by 2030, we will have all the raw <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. I'll explain in a moment how I think we can get that. But, the question then comes, once you have the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, can you really make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of it? Or, are we inherently, as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, incapable of understanding the organization of our own brains?</p>
<p>The reality is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> process is very hot on the heels of the availability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> models and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> interconnection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not one big tabular rasa or one big neural net. There are hundreds of specialized regions. In each region there are different types of wiring or interconnections. The <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are structured differently. And they're optimized with very different kinds of functions.</p>
<p>Lloyd Wright has developed a detailed model of the auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, or a significant portion of the auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, that shows five parallel pathways. And, he has identified about 20 different <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions, which each do different types of processing, trying to identify the location of sounds in three dimensions, and there's a different way of doing it left to right and up and down. The model is trying to separate different sounds that are coming from different sources, and identifying what they are.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231828im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart23.gif" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Such modeling is used extensively in speech recognition. We've actually only been using the results of modeling two of those five pathways; some of the other pathways actually would help us, for example, to eliminate background <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> by being able to identify a particular person's voice coming from a particular location and eliminating other voices coming from other locations.</p>
<p>But, Lloyd has a very detailed model including the way in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is encoded in the inter-<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al signals at each stage. And, he has implemented that model. The model does the same sorts of things with the same acuity as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. It's very impressive work. It also demonstrates that these simulations require on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 100 or 1,000 times less <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> than the theoretical potential of these <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. But, it also shows the feasibility of taking the detailed models coming from neuro-<a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, and the detailed scans that are coming from <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, and putting them together in very intricate models of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not one organ. It's really hundreds of specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing organs.</p>
<p>We'll get the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, I think ultimately by scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from the inside, and Rob Freitas' book will help us in this process. A we get to the third decade of this century, the 2020's, we will be sending little <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s inside our bloodstream. They we all be on a <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>, and they can be scanning from inside As Rob points out, many of these will have medical applications.</p>
<p>We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, that, if you put the scanning probe right near the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, it can see it with extremely high resolution, almost good enough today to what we need to accurately scan these internal connections. But, you have to be right near the neural features. So, if you send nano scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s through the capillaries of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which by definition travel next to every neural feature, and send billions of them, with various ways having them transmit the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and compiling it back, you can get very detailed <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>s from inside. At leas, that's one way of doing it.</p>
<p>Another way, of course, is to do a destructive scan, which is feasible today. There's one condemned killer who actually agreed to have his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ned. You can see the 10 billion bytes of his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">internet</a>. There's also a 25 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/byte_entry.html">byte</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> companion up there as well.</p>
<p>A project at Carnegie Mellon is now scanning a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with 100 nanometer resolution, which is almost good enough for these applications. Destructive scanning actually is good enough also to give us the raw <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from which to do the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> that will enable us to understand how the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works.</p>
<p>We already use these very early results. For example, in the mid-1990's,some detailed models became available for the early stages of auditory processing in at least two of the five parallel pathways. We (at Kurzweil Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>, Inc.) implemented those in speech recognition. Our competitors did as well, Dragon and <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> in the front end of speech recognition. And it definitely improves the quality of speech recognition. With these more detailed models now becoming available, we'll be able to do an even better job of dealing with things like background <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>.</p>
<p>So, as these models become available from <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and the neural processes we have there, there's a very quick and rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion from the availability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> models and interconnection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, two <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering models, to working simulations, to applying that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the creation of more intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. As we really understand how the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> fits together and works, and we're far from that today, but because of the acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, because of the ability of being able to make things smaller, and ultimately sending that into the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> where we can get a very close look at how it works, we'll have very good ideas, and very accurate models by 2030 of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works, which will give us great insight into ourselves, into <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">Emotion</a>, by the way, is not some kind of side issue that distracts us from the real capability of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">Emotion</a> and our ability to recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> and respond appropriately to it, is the most complex, richest, deepest, most subtle thing that we do. It's a real exemplar of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. If we understand that better, we'll have better insight into ourselves, we'll have better insight into <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> dysfunction, and we'll be able to create more and more intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>Another scenario using these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in 2030, is to send them through the bloodstream to take up positions around nerves and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s within the brain; the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s is actually <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>. So, if you <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s and have them take their positions by all the <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> fibers coming from all of our sensors, you can provide full immersion, shared <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments from within, encompassing all of the senses.</p>
<p>If you want to be in real reality, they just sit there and do nothing; if you want to enter <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they shut down the signals coming from your real senses, replace them with the signals that would be appropriate for the virtual environment. And then you can be an actor in the virtual environment. You can decide to move your hand in front of your face. Your real hand doesn't move. It instead moves your virtual hand.</p>
<p>And you can see it, you can hear it. You can have other people in your shared virtual environment who also see you do those things. And you can have any kind of interaction with anyone, from business negotiations to central encounters in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> encompassing all of the senses. And these can also involve other neurological correlates of secondary reactions to our sensory experiences.</p>
<p>In my book, I talk about open <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> surgery where this young girl was conscious during the surgery. When they stimulated a specific spot in her <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, she began to laugh. They assumed well, they must be triggering some kind of involuntary laugh reflex. But they quickly discovered that no, they actually were triggering the perception of <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>. Whenever they stimulated this spot, she just found everything hilarious. Her typical comment was, "You guys are just so funny standing there." And everything was a riot.</p>
<p>Through our neurological correlates, (some of which may be more complex than just stimulating a specific spot, but there are correlates of our secondary experiences from sexual pleasure to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al reaction) certainly things like fear and <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a> can be detected, and also can be triggered.</p>
<p>So, we'll have people, rather than just sending out their grainy images as they do today from web CAM's in their living room, sending out their full stream of sensory experiences, as well as their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al overlays. You can experience someone else's <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, a la John Malkovich, with these experience beamers circa 2030. Most of those experiences probably won't be that interesting, so you might want to go to the archive where more interesting experiences will be saved.</p>
<p>This will be an important way in which we can get together and communicate. Certainly meetings like this, or any kind of interaction between two or more people can be in shared environments. And we're going to start down that path this decade with <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s inside our bodies and brains that are nonetheless very close to our bodies as the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> gets more and more personal.</p>
<p>These <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s can also expand our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Since they are communicating <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly, they can create a new connection, a virtual connection. The computing or <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that takes place in our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is in the inter-neural connections is not a simple wire. There are various complex things that happen to the signals. But, those can be modeled, and have been modeled quite successfully in a number of cases, showing the feasibility of this.</p>
<p>If we have two <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s communicating <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly, they can create a new internal connection. So, now, instead of having 100 trillion connections in your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, you can have a 100 trillion and one. That won't do you much good. And none of the connections are all that important. There's no chief executive officer <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> or connection. Our brains are different than <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>If you go open up your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> and cut one of the wires, you'll probably break it. But, if you break any of the internal connections in your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, or even thousands of them, it has absolutely no effect. It's much more holographic in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that it is the patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that are important. So, adding one connection won't do any good, but you could double the connections and ultimately have another 100 trillion connections. That will make a minor difference.</p>
<p>If you look at the trends and see the kind of capabilities that the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will provide, you can see how we can expand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We can multiply the capacity of our brains many-fold, ultimately by factors of thousands or millions. By the end of the century, it's actually by factors of trillions. When you meet somebody in 2040, typically a person of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> origin, they will have <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> processes going on inside their <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that are <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> as well as non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>.</p>
<p>However, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is flat. I mean, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race right now, under 10 billion people, have approximately 10 to the 26 power calculations per second. And that's a generous estimate. And that's going to still be 10 of the 26 calculations per second at the end of the century.</p>
<p>Non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is growing exponentially. It's under that figure by a factor of more than a million; but it's growing. It will cross over before 2030. And by the end of the century, non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> will be trillions of times more powerful than <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. And people say, "Okay, it will be very powerful, but it won't have the subtlety and the suppleness and the richness of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>; they'll just be extremely fast <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s." But, that's not true.</p>
<p>Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, the richness, the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is going to be understood and reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered and utilized by these non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>I'll make one last point, and hopefully we will have a few minutes for questions. There are some natural advantages of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s can share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. If I spend years <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> French, I can't <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to you. We don't have quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports on the patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in our brains.</p>
<p>But, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. We spend years training one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> speech, (and it learns because we're using chaotic methods, self organizing methods like neural nets and markup models and <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s). As it learns the material, it's developing a pattern.</p>
<p>Now, if you want your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> to understand you and speak to you, you don't have to spend years training it; you can just load the pattern that we evolved in our <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> by loading the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. We don't have the ways of doing that with <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. But, with non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, we'll be able to do that. And, non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is much faster. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s is already 10 million times faster than the ponderous speed of our internal connections.</p>
<p>And the accuracy of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is far greater in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. I mean, we're hard pressed to remember a handful of phone numbers, whereas <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can remember billions of things quite accurately. If you combine those advantages with a real <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, and harness the subtlety and strength of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> represents, that will be a very formidable combination.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Question &amp; Answer:</p>
<p>Q: You have been not merely an <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>, an innovator, an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er, but really an artist of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. And I don't want anyone to think that what I have to say is an attack on your character. (laughter)</p>
<p>You have done a tremendous amount of work here documenting the trends and making the case very convincingly for the overall trend in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that you have perceived. And I generally share your perception, although I might argue with some of your timetables and so forth. As you've said, that's not really important. What is important is the overall trends, the overall direction.</p>
<p>I myself work in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. I'm a graduate student doing work in <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. I've read your book, <i>The </i><a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>. I've also read a great deal of other material from what is a very large and growing cult, but known basically as <a class="thought" href="entries/extropian_entry.html">extropian</a>s, trans-humanists--basically, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> worshippers. And you are now the most notable, most articulate, and I would say the leading exponent of that point of view.</p>
<p>Your message is not primarily technological, I think, although you've done such a good job here today with outlining the technical trends. But really, it is a moral and philosophical message that you've brought to the public. And I have to say I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to tell you here in front of this audience what I think of that.</p>
<p>In terms of a <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, a moral <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, it is the nadir, it is the new low, the new depths of depravity. Hitler only wanted to exterminate certain groups of people, but you have advocated the extermination or the gradual <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>, the elimination of the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race and its replacement by something else, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Now, you have not proposed any <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> camps, you have not proposed the use of force; rather you use seductive <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, and this notion of man/<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> convergence and so on. By these means, by these gradual means, you propose that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> shall replace the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race. This is the most hideous notion that has ever been proposed in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>RK: Well, first I'd say, don't shoot the messenger. But, I think you forcefully articulate a legitimate and, I think, fundamentally important point. And the question is whether what I'm talking about amounts to a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist point of view where I'm saying that people are just <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, or whether I'm really elevating the concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to something profound.</p>
<p>I think the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> moves forward in incremental steps, each of which makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, and guides us along a certain path. And it's not that we're going to suddenly wake up in 2050 and realize that we've suddenly altered humanity in this profound way. We're going to get there one step at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for example, is not one field. <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>'s idea of "let's just shut down <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, we'll just shut those couple of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> labs and close down <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> and other companies" won't work. It's a pervasive trend of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, to make things smaller.</p>
<p>We've been expanding the capabilities of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> by amplifying our ability, including our direct personal ability, through <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. These trends are going to get more and more powerful. In my view, this is still the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. And this is what it will look like as we go through this century. Of course, the story of the century hasn't been written yet, and there are some dangers. And I think the dangers that <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> has talked about are real, but I don't think <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> is a viable or responsible direction to move in.</p>
<p>Q: Why not have humans maintain control of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, instead of allowing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to control <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> destiny?</p>
<p>RK: Well, let me finish. I think we are in control of it. I think, as we make <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> smaller, to put it inside our clothing, inside our bodies and brains, which we're doing already today, we make those decisions one step at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. And my own view is that this will enhance what we value about humanity. And we're making <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> more capable, and more of what we value as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings.</p>
<p>I really think it comes down to what I said earlier. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s." If you take what most people think of the word <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, and say we're going to make <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings into <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, it is as depressing a vision as you describe. However, if you have a different view that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is really an <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of humanity, we're going to increase the power of our own ability, particularly in the area of the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>. And those things are going to become richer. We're going to become more of what we value of humanity, then it's a profoundly positive vision. I see it as the next step of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>It's not so much something I'm advocating; it is something that I think is going to happen. And we do need to guide it. The difference though between <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has been called "the <a class="thought" href="entries/blind_watchmaker_entry.html">blind watchmaker</a>." I don't like that term because it's insensitive to blind people. Call it "a mindless watchmaker," whereas <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is guided by a <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful thesis. We do have the responsibility to guide this in ways that emphasize our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> values, despite the fact that we don't have an absolute consensus on what those are. We could talk a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> about this, but that's my view.</p>
<p>Q: With this last <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> remaining, I'm interested in hearing what your conversation about <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> what <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a> was about. And, I think, perhaps related to that is your talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s entering the body and triggering or turning off the functions of certain <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. I'll be in trouble for putting it quite this way, but--where is the locus of meaning? Where is any kind of meaning--and I don't mean that to be a broadly philosophical question--and where is the bottom line of the experience? How do you internalize that? Once those <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s are in the bloodstream--the status of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> changes.</p>
<p>In a central experience, perhaps the <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> isn't as significant as, say, in a business experience where people might want to have a bottom line accomplished But, first, I guess if you could briefly talk about Searle's position and your position on the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>RK: Well, another profoundly important question. The locus of meaning is maybe a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> different than the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. In my mind, meaning and some of the higher level <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings deal with are emergent properties of very profound subtle patterns of activity that take place in our brains.</p>
<p>And it's really the output of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. As I said before, the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> is the most subtle thing we do. It's not some side effect of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. I think any <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> as complex as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is going to necessarily have <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, at least as a behavior.</p>
<p>But, your real question gets at trying to separate or focus on the difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> and ability to deal with it as an objective phenomena and what we actually experience. It's one thing to look at this girl's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> as some kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, you trigger it, she starts laughing and you deal with it as a cause and effect. And it's another thing that she's actually experiencing <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>, or we experience fear or passion or any of the other things we experience. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a> says that I'm a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist, but I think that he's a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist. In my mind it's a deep mystery, not a scientific question. There is no scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> into which you can slide something into the end and a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> will go on, conscious or not conscious. We will have entities in 2030, 2040 that claim to be conscious. We have them today, but they're not very convincing. But, in 2040, they'll claim to be conscious and they'll be very convincing. They'll have all the subtle, <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al, and rich kinds of behaviors, the kind that convince us that each other are conscious.</p>
<p>But, some people will say, "Well, no, that <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is not conscious because it doesn't squirt <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s, it's not <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>." And there's no way to resolve those questions. You can argue about it. Look inside its <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. It's got the feedback loops and it's modeling the environment, and it's just as complex and rich as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being. In fact, it's a copy of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, modified in certain ways.</p>
<p>But, no, it's not <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, it can't be conscious. There's no absolute way we can resolve that. We have a consensus with each other, conscious that other <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings that don't appear to be unconscious are conscious. But, as you go outside to share a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> experience, that consensus breaks down. We argue about <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. That's at the <a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>'s right issue. Are our <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s really experiencing the <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s they seem to be experiencing?</p>
<p>When we say that they do, even that's a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> centric reaction because we've seen <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s acting in a way that reminds us of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s. I think my <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> is conscious, but other people don't agree because they haven't met my <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>. But, this issue will be even more <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ious when we get to non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities, whose behavior is even closer to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior than <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s are.</p>
<p>But, there's no absolute way to identify or to measure consicousness. It comes down to the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> difference between objective and subjective. <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> is about objective measurement and the <a class="thought" href="entries/deduction_entry.html">deduction</a>s we can make from that. And subjectivity is another word for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. And there's really no way to enter the <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> of another <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>.</p>
<p>Now, how will we resolve this question? Well, we'll resolve it politically. These <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be so intelligent and so subtle, they'll be able to convince most people that they're conscious. If we don't believe them, they'll get mad at us. So, we'll probably end up believing them. But, that's a political prediction, not a real philosophical statement.</p>
<p>Searle says no, we can measure <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, and we're going to discover some specific <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> process in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that causes <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>However, there's no actual conception; if anything, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is an emerging property of the supremely complex subtle patterns that take place in our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. But, even that, in my view, can't be absolutely measured in an objective way. In my view, Searle is a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that it's just some physical process. He actually says that <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is just another <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> property and compares <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of digestion, and we'll discover what the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is. And then we'll know that something is conscious.</p>
<p>So, I pointed out, "Well, if we discover that, why can't we build a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that has the same frame?"</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
