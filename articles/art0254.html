<div class="TeaserText">The neural net approach to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> explained, written for "The Futurecast," a monthly column in the Library Journal.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published October 1992. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 6, 2001.</p>
<p>Consider the task of the lowly <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. Signals stream in from the thousands of branches of its dendrites, each representing a message from another <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. Some of the messages are subtle, others are urgent. The mission of the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> is to render a judgment. It does this by summarizing the thousands of chaotic messages it receives into a coherent answer that reflects its particular view of the world. Its conclusion is expressed in rather simple terms: it either sends its characteristic threshold message or it doesn't.</p>
<p>The human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> has been called the most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> in the world. It is certainly the most complex that we are aware of (although the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>s of certain other mammals such as dolphins and elephants are arguably more extensive). It is the organ of our bodies that gives rise to mind, to <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, to our awareness of our <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. Within the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, there is astonishing <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of function and form. Yet despite the broad variety of neuronal <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and purpose, the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> used by the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is remarkably uniform.</p>
<p>The typical <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> has a soma or cell body, thread-like extensions called dendrites, and a single projection called an axon. The dendrites, which act as the inputs to the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, generally look like trees branching into finer and finer structures with the trunks extending from the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> cell body. The "leafs" of these input trees terminate at synapses (gaps) that receive messages from other neureons. The output of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, called the axon, also looks like a tree (with a long trunk), which may also branch into finer and finer structures. The "leafs" of the output axon tree also terminate at synapses that communicate with the inputs (terminal dendrites) of other neurons. The <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> that allows a message to pass from a terminal leaf of the (output) axon tree of one <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to a terminal leaf of an (input) dendrite tree of some other <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>.</p>
<p>Each nerve fiber (dendrite or axon) is capable of transmitting signals or packets of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> potentials. These signals are manifest in electrical potentials of about 100 millivolts that last for a millisecond and result from the actual movement of charged sodium ions across the fiber's membrane. The fiber does not make a good electrical wire as its resistance is too high, so the signal generally dies within a millimeter or two. Thus the potential must be recreated frequently along the way by a series of electro-chemical processes. The speed of the signal is, therefore, quite slow - no more than 100 meters per second, which is a million times slower than the electrical signals used in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p><h1>Chemical messengers</h1><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> across the <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> between an axon (output) branch of one <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> and a dendrite (input) branch of another <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> has been the subject of considerable <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, in part because it is here that most <a class="thought" href="entries/psychotropic_entry.html">psychotropic</a> drugs have their influence. The transfer of an <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> potential across a <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> is mediated by a variety of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, of which close to 50 have been identified. Cocaine, for example, facilitates (at Ieast at first) the transmission of <a class="thought" href="entries/dopamine_entry.html">dopamine</a>. Interestingly, many antipsychotic drugs have the opposite effect. Chronic use of cocaine, however, results in the total disruption of <a class="thought" href="entries/dopamine_entry.html">dopamine</a> absorption, which influences the <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> of pleasure as well as other vital processes. Prozac, a popular antidepressant, intensifies the effect of <a class="thought" href="entries/serotonin_entry.html">serotonin</a>, another key <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>.&#160;The soma acts as a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but not a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> one. It is essentially an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, integrating (adding and subtracting over time) the signals from its dendrite branches. The signals vary in strength and are given different weights (i.e., levels of importance) by the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. To this sum, the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> applies a "nonlinearity," a thresholding function that is a key to the ability of this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. The purpose of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> is to destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Indeed the selective destruction of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is what <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is all about. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) pioneer Ed Feigenbaum says that "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> is not the same as <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>; <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that has been pared and shaped." Our eyes alone provide the equivalent of 50 billion bits of data every second. Clearly, we could not begin to make sense of such a vast river of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> unless we select very carefully certain abstractions that warrant our attention.</p>
<p>A typical <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> receives <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from hundreds or thousands of dendritic branches. Each of these inputs reflects either a datum of sensory input or the judgment of another <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. Essentially, the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> waits until the sum of its weighted inputs exceeds its characteristic threshold level, at which point its electrical potential explodes by sending an <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> potential down its axon. It thus summarizes these hundreds or thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> (continuously variable) values into its own judgment, usually expressed as a single bit of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (yes or no). Each layer of neural processing exhibits the ability to extract increasingly abstract levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. In visual processing, for example, David Hubel and Tanten Diesel of the Harvard Medical School have discovered specialized cells that are adjacent to the retinal photoreceptor "cone" cells that are "wired" to detect "edges" in visual images. These in turn are summarized by the next layer of neurons that detect lines and curves in certain orientations. After several dozen more layers of <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>, there are neurons that respond to the percept of particular faces.</p>
<p>Key to this process is the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of feedback, without which a net of neurons would be unable to learn. The relative strength of each <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> may be increased or decreased to better reflect the desired response. There appear to be specific modulatory neurons that facilitate this process. There are a variety of neural <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> techniques that have been hyped, and the exact mechanisms involved is an area of particularly intense contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. Regardless of the means, however, the performance of each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> is constantly being monitored, and the synaptic strengths are continually readjusted to improve the overall performance of each layer of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. Neurons can also grow new dendritic and axon branches and create new synapses with other neurons. You may be doing this right now as you read this month's Futurecast.</p>
<p>While the electrochemical implementation of the neural process is complex, the basic computational <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> is simple and surprisingly powerfuL In essence, a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> takes the outputs of other neurons, weights each of these values according to a set of changing synaptic weights, takes the sum of these weighted values, and then compares the sum to a threshold value. It then communicates its fundamentally yes or no judgment to other neurons. Periodically, the synaptic weights are adjusted to improve the ability of a net of neurons to perform their intended function.&#160;The output of each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> is, therefore, a very simple summary of its inputs. Through elaborate timed cascades and hierarchies of such simplification functions, percepts and concepts are realized and decisions made.</p><h1>Decisions, decisions</h1><p>As humans form societies, we see the same process of simplification and summarization in almost every activity. Consider an election: As we consider each candidate, each of us weighs many complex factors but finally renders a very simple judgment - yes or no on each candidate. We may not be consciously aware of how we weighted each factor, or even what all of the factors are, yet we nonetheless are able to come to a decision. Each of these <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> judgments flow into thousands or millions of other similar judgements. All of this enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is finally summarized by a few bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>: each candidate either wins or loses. This decision then flows into yet other derisions.</p>
<p>There are three aspects of this decision process that are counterintuitive. First, this type of decision-making process is fundamental to all <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Our ability to make sense of our senses, to navigate our lives at every level depends on a massive process of decision-making, where every decision results in the destruction of almost all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that went into the decision. Only a very simple summary of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that went into each judgment is passed on to the next level. It is not just our conscious decisions that use this process, but all levels of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Second, very little of our decision-making is what we might regard as "rational," but rather the result of a panoply of inherently irrational judgments. Third, the vast majority of our decisions are not conscious. Even our nominally conscious decisions are heavily influenced by millions of preconscious judgments.</p><h1>Re-creating human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a></h1><p>In addition to helping us understand human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, insights into human <a class="thought" href="entries/neurobiology_entry.html">neurobiology</a> have provided an approach to recreating <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that is radically different from the logic-based approaches that have been dominant in the early <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Such "neural nets" use mathematical models of neurons with simulated dendrites, axons, and synapses.</p>
<p>A particularly effective contemporary application of neural nets is the automatic recognition of hand-printed characters. Letters and numbers written by hand are often sloppy and unpredictable, and thus it is difficult for the more traditional rule-based approaches to deal with the highly variable forms created by human handwriting. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>-based neural nets do not need to be provided with rules at all; they simply need to be exposed to tens of thousands of examples of the patterns to be recognized. Then through extensive trial and error, they are capable of developing their own rules.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">Pattern recognition</a> systems based on neural nets learn the same way that people do - slowly. Previously, designers of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> systems had to provide handcrafted algorithms that defined the patterns to be recognized. For example, the designer of a character-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> might <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> in the fact that a capital D consists of a straight vertical line connected to the right half of a circle. The human designer of a neural-netbased character-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, on the other hand, does not need to be concerned with such rules nor does the designer even need to define the types of patterns that are expected. The neural net <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is able to discover these rules for itself. Instead, the task of the neural net designer is similar to that of a kindergarten teacher patiently providing thousands of examples from which the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can learn and providing it feedback as to when it is right and wrong</p>
<p>The designer also needs to set up the initial neural connections with the right topology. The wiring of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not random, but is exquisitely set up to facilitate the types of patterns that humans deal with - objects, faces, <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, music, and the myriad other skills that make up human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Neural net <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been employed in an increasing variety of tasks ranging from recognizing human speech to making financial credit decisions. In the latter case, designers recently allowed a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based neural net to learn by "watching" the decisions of its human counterparts. Apparently, it learned its lessons too well, discovering not only the proper methods of credit authorization, but also mastering its human teachers' unconscious (or at least undocumented) prejudices. It apparently would refuse credit to anyone from a disadvantaged neighborhood regardless of the applicant's credit <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>In the past two months we have examined two radically different approaches to capturing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, examined in last month's Futurecast, has been a popular and successful technique using conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> architectures. The human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is not very effective at using the recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, but relies instead on the neural net <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> described above. We are now discovering that computers can make effective use of both approaches.</p>
<p>In next month's column, we will examine what it would take to create a neural net with the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, what such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> might be capable of achieving, and when that will be feasible.</p>
