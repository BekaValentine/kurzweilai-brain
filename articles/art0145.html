<div class="TeaserText">We are re-evolving artificial minds at ten million times the original speed of human evolution, exponentially growing robot complexity. Currently, a guppylike thousand MIPS and hundreds of megabytes of memory enable our robots to build dense, almost photorealistic 3D maps of their surroundings and navigate intelligently. Within three decades, fourth-generation universal robots with a humanlike 100 million MIPS will be able to abstract and generalize--perhaps replace us.</div>

<p>Originally published December 2000 as an academic paper, Carnegie Mellon University. Published on KurzweilAI.net March 27, 2001. Original article can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/Cerebrum.html" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s have permeated everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and are worming their way into our gadgets, dwellings, clothes, even bodies. But if pervasive computing soon automates most of our <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>al needs, it will leave untouched a vaster number of essential physical tasks. Construction, protection, repair, cleaning, transport and so forth will remain in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> hands.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">Robot</a> inventors in home, university and industrial laboratories have tinkered with the problem for most of the century. While mechanical bodies adequate for manual work can be built, artificial minds for autonomous servants have been frustratingly out of reach, despite the arrival of powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. </p>
<p>The first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in the 1950s did the work of thousands of clerks. But when those superhuman behemoths were <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, they merely matched single <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beginners in razor-narrow tasks. <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>med to control <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> eyes and arms, they took pathetic hours to unreliably find and grasp a few wooden blocks. The situation did not improve substantially for decades. </p>
<p>But things are changing. <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">Robot</a> tasks wildly impossible in the 1970s and 1980s began to work experimentally in the 1990s. Robots mapped and navigated unfamiliar office suites, and <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> vehicles drove themselves, mostly unaided, across entire countries. Vision <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s locate textured objects and track and analyze faces in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">Personal computer</a>s recognize text and speech. Why suddenly now? </p><h1>Trick of Perspective</h1><p>The short answer is that, after decades at about one <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> (million instructions, or calculations, per second), <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power available to <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> robots shot through 10, 100 and now 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>, starting about 1990 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/CACM/1980-2000.scr.jpg" target="_new">(Figure 1)</a>.</p>
<p>This deserves explanation because the cost-effectiveness of computing rose steadily all those decades <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97/ch3/AI.power.075.jpg" target="_new">(Figure 2)</a>.</p>
<p>In 1960 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were a new and mysterious factor in the cold war, and even outlandish possibilities like <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> warranted significant investment. In the early 1960s <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s ran on the era's <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s, similar to those used for physical simulations by weapons physicists and meteorologists. By the 1970s the promise of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> had faded, and the effort limped for a decade on old <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. In contrast, weapons labs upgraded repeatedly to new <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, departmental <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s gave way to smaller project <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s then to individual workstations and <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s. Prices fell at each transition, but power per <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> stayed about the same. Only after 1990 did prices stabilize and power grow. </p>
<p>It was a common opinion in the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> labs that, with the right <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, readily available <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could encompass any <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> skill. The position seemed obvious in the 1950s, when <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s did the work of thousands, and defensible in the 1970s, as inference and game-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s performed at modest <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels.</p>
<p>The upstart subfields of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> vision and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, however had a different impression. On one <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, single images crammed <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, simply scanning them consumed seconds, and serious image analysis took hours. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> vision performed far more elaborate functions many times a second. </p>
<p>It's easy to explain the discrepancy in hindsight. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s do arithmetic using as few gates and <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing operations as possible. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> calculation, by contrast, is a laboriously learned, ponderous, awkward, unnatural behavior. Tens of billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in our vision and motor <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s strain to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ize and process a digit a second. If our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> were rewired into 10 billion arithmetic <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, each doing 100 calculations a second, by a mad <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designer with a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> surgical tool, we'd outcompute early <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s a millionfold, and the illusion of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power would be exposed. <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a>, in fact, was such an expose. </p>
<p>Though spectacular underachievers at the wacky new stunt of longhand calculation, we are veteran overachievers at perception and navigation. Our ancestors, across hundreds of millions of years, prevailed by being frontrunners in the competition to find food, escape danger and protect offspring. Existing <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>-controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are far too feeble to match the resulting prodigious perceptual inheritance. But by how much? </p>
<p>The vertebrate <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> is understood well enough to be a kind of Rosetta stone roughly relating nervous tissue to <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Besides <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> detectors, the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> contains edge- and motion-detecting <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry, packed into a little tenth-millimeter-thick, two-centimeter-wide patch that reports on a million image regions in parallel about ten times a second via the optic <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a>. In <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> vision, similar detections, well coded, each require the execution of a few hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> instructions, making the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>'s 10 million detections per second worth over 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>.</p>
<p>In a risky extrapolation that must serve until something better emerges, it would take about 50,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> to functionally imitate a rat-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s gram of neural tissue, and almost 100 million <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> (or 100 trillion instructions per second) to emulate the 1,500 gram <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. PCs in 1999 matched <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a> nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, but fell short of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> and a goldfish's 0.1 gram <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. They were a millionfold too weak to do the job of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. </p>
<p>While dispiriting to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> pioneers, the deficit does not warrant abandoning their goals. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> power for a given price roughly doubled each year in the 1990s, after doubling every 18 months in the 1980s, and every two years prior. Two or three decades more at the present pace would close the millionfold gap. Better yet, sufficiently useful robots don't need full <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale brainpower.</p><h1>Re-Evolving Mind</h1><p>The incremental <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power suggests an incremental approach to developing <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, probably an accelerated parallel to the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that's its model. Unlike other approaches, this path demands no great theories or insights (helpful though they can be): natural <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> evolved in small steps through a chain of viable organisms, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> can do the same. <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> performed <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary experiments at an approximately steady rate, even when evolved traits such as <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> grew exponentially.</p>
<p>Similarly, a steady <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering effort should be able to support exponentially growing <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> (especially as ever more of the design <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> is delegated to increasingly powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s). The journey will be much easier the second <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> around: we have a guide, with directions and distances, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of vertebrate nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>General industrial development in <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, materials, manufacturing and elsewhere has already carried us well along the road. A series of notable experimental <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>-like robots built using their day's best techniques read like mileposts along the road to <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#183; Around 1950, Bristol University psychologist William Gray Walter, a pioneer brainwave <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er, built eight <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> "Tortoises," each with a scanning phototube eye and two <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a> amplifiers driving relays that <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ed steering and drive motors <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/revo.slides/1950.jpg" target="_new">(Figure 3)</a>. Unprecedently lifelike, they danced around a lighted recharging hutch until batteries ran low, then entered. But simple <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> show equally engaging tropisms.</li>
<li>&#183; In the early 1960s the Johns Hopkins University Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> Lab built the corridor cruising, wall-outlet-recharging "Beast" <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/revo.slides/1960.jpg" target="_new">(Figure 4)</a>. Using specialized wall-ranging sonars, outlet-seeking photocell optics and a wallplate-feeling arm, all orchestrated by several dozen <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, the Beast's multiple coordinated behaviors resemble a large nucleated <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s, for instance a <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>-hunting <a class="thought" href="entries/paramecium_entry.html">Paramecium</a>.</li>
<li>&#183; Big mobile robots radio-controlled by huge <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s appeared around 1970 at Stanford University and nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/sri_entry.html">SRI</a>. While a Tortoise's <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s followed directly from two or three <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and touch discriminations, and the Beast's simply from a few dozen signals, Stanford's "Cart" <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/revo.slides/1970.jpg" target="_new">(Figure 5a)</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/sri_entry.html">SRI</a>'s "Shakey" <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/revo.slides/1970b.jpg" target="_new">(Figure 5b)</a> used TV images with thousands of pixels to choose <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s after millions of calculations. The Cart adapted and predicted to track dirty white lines in ambient <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shakey, more ambitiously but less reliably, identified and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ed about large blocks. The advent of multicellular <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s with nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion 550 million years ago blew the lid on <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> behavioral <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. The introduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> control did the same for robots.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#183; By 1980 a slightly faster <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and a more complex <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> allowed Stanford's Cart, using stereoscopic vision, to sparsely map and negotiate obstacle courses, taking five hours to cover 30 meters (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/CACM/1980-2000.scr.jpg" target="_new">Figure 1</a>, first panel). In <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and speed the performance was sluglike.</li>
<li>&#183; Several <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> robots in the early 1990s navigated and two-dimensionally mapped corridor <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/CACM/1980-2000.scr.jpg" target="_new">Figure 1</a>, second panel). Some optimized their interpretations of sensor <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> processes. Onboard and offboard 10 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>s conferred brainpower like the tiniest fish, or middling <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s.</li>
<li>&#183; In 2000 a guppylike thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> and hundreds of megabytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> enabled our robots to build dense, almost photorealistic 3D maps of their surroundings (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/CACM/1980-2000.scr.jpg" target="_new">Figure 1</a>, third panel). Navigation techniques built around this core spatial awareness will suffice, I believe, to guide mobile utility robots reliably through unfamiliar surroundings, suiting them for jobs in hundreds of thousands of industrial locations and eventually hundreds of millions of homes. Such abilities have so long eluded that only a few dozen small <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> groups pursue them. But the number of <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> developers will balloon once a vigorous commercial industry emerges. The continued <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of robotkind will then become a driver rather than a mere beneficiary of general technical development.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and technological development rates compare? The very simple to the very complex can be found in both realms, and new designs are as likely to increase simplicity as <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. But the simple end of the range is crammed with competitors, while the complex limit is the beginning of an endless unexplored design <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Organisms or products that are slightly more complex than any before sometimes succeed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> or the marketplace, and thus raise the upper limit.</p>
<p>Paleontological and historical records can be scanned for this upper limit, which mostly rises over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. There are reversals in both records: notably mass <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> collapses. But, after a recovery period, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> resumes, often faster than before. If complex entities succumb to disaster, many of their <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> innovations may yet survive somewhere. Classical <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> weathered the collapse of Roman <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> in the remote Islamic world. Some inactive <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> sequences seem to be archives of ancestral traits.</p>
<p>Extincted large organisms may leave much of their heritage behind in smaller relatives, who can rapidly "re-evolve" size and complex adaptations by simple mutations in regulator genes. The re-<a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of old good ideas in odd combinations often initiates an explosion of innovation. Such happened culturally in the <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">Renaissance</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly in the Paleocene, when birds and <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s ran riot in the post-dinosaur world.</p>
<p>Though creative explosions, catastrophic losses and stagnant periods in both realms, and varying investment scales in different technical projects disturb the trends, let us compare the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of biggest nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s since the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> capacity of common big <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s since World War II. Wormlike <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s with perhaps a few hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s evolved early in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a>, over 570 million years ago.</p>
<p>The first electromechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, with a few hundred bits of telephone relay storage, were built around 1940. Earliest vertebrates, very primitive fish with nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s probably smaller than the modern hagfish's, perhaps 100,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, appeared about 470 million years ago. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s acquired 100,000 bits of rotating magnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> by 1955. Amphibians with perhaps a salamander's few million <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s crawled out of the water 370 million years ago.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s with millions of bits of magnetic core <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> were available by 1965. By 1975, many <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> core memories had exceeded 10 million bits and by 1985 100 million bits was common, though large <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were being largely displaced by small workstations and even smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s.</p>
<p>Small <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s showed up about 220 million years ago, with brains ranging to several hundred million <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, while enormous dinosaurs around them bore brains with several billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, a situation that changed only slowly until the sudden <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Our small primate ancestors arose soon after, with brains ranging to several billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s.</p>
<p>Larger <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s had several billion by 1995. Hominid apes with twenty billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> brains appeared about 30 million years ago. In 2,000, some ambitious <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> owners equipped their <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s tens of billions of bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">RAM</a>. Humans have approximately 100 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. 100 billion bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">RAM</a> will be standard in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s within five years.</p>
<p>Plot these juxtaposed geologic and recent dates against one another (the alignment of bits to <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s is arbitrary, and can be shifted with affecting the slope) and you will discover that large <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s capacities grew each decade about as much as the large nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s grew every hundred million years. We seem to be re-evolving mind (in a fashion) at ten million times the original speed! </p><h1>Earning a Living</h1><p>Commercial mobile robots, which must perform reliably, have tended to use techniques about a decade after they first appeared experimentally. The smartest ones, barely <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>like at 10 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>, have found few jobs. A paltry ten thousand work worldwide, and companies that made them are struggling or defunct (<a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> manipulators have a similar story).</p>
<p>The largest class, Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs), transport materials in factories and warehouses. Most follow buried signal-emitting wires and detect endpoints and collisions with <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es, techniques introduced in the 1960s. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to install guide wires under concrete floors, and the routes are then fixed, making the robots economical only for large, exceptionally stable factories.</p>
<p>Some robots made possible by the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>s in the 1980s track softer cues, like patterns in tiled floors, and use ultrasonics and infrared proximity sensors to detect and negotiate their way around obstacles.</p>
<p>The most advanced industrial mobile robots to date, developed since the late 1980s, are guided by occasional navigational markers, for instance <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a>-sensed bar codes, and by preexisting features like walls, corners and doorways. The hard-hat labor of laying guide wires is replaced by <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming carefully tuned for each route segment.</p>
<p>The small companies that developed the robots discovered many industrial customers eager to automate transport, floor cleaning, security patrol and other routine jobs. Alas, most buyers lost interest as they realized that installation and route changing required <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-consuming and expensive work by experienced route <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers of precarious availability. Technically successful, the robots fizzled commercially. But in failure they revealed the essentials for success.</p>
<p>First one needs <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably-priced physical vehicles to do various jobs. Fortunately existing AGVs, fork lift trucks, floor scrubbers and other industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s designed for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> riders or to follow wires can be adapted for <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the customer should be able, unassisted, to rapidly put a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> to work where needed. Floor cleaning and most other mundane tasks cannot bear the cost, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and uncertainty of expert installation.</p>
<p>Third, the robots must work for at least six months between missteps. Customers routinely rejected robots that, after a month of flawless operation, wedged themselves in corners, wandered away lost, rolled over employees' feet or fell down stairs. Six months, however, earned the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s a sick day.</p>
<p>Robots exist that work faultlessly for years, perfected by a repeated process that fixes the most frequent failures, revealing successively rarer problems that are corrected in turn. Alas, the reliability has been achieved only for prearranged routes. <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">Insect</a>like 10 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> is just enough to track a few hand-picked landmarks on each path segment.</p>
<p>Such robots are easily confused by minor surprises like shifted bar codes or blocked corridors, not unlike ants on scent trails or moths guided by the moon, who can be trapped by circularized trails or streetlights. (Unlike plodding robots, though, <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s routinely take lethal risks, and thus have more interesting, if short, lives.) </p><h1>A <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">Sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a></h1><p>Robots that chart their own routes emerged from laboratories worldwide in the mid 1990s, as <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>s reached 100 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>. Most build two-dimensional maps from sonar or <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> rangefinder scans to locate and route themselves, and the best seem able to navigate office hallways sometimes for days between confusions.</p>
<p>To date they fall far short of the six-month commercial criterion. Too often different locations in coarse 2D maps resemble one another, or the same location, scanned at different heights, looks different, or small obstacles or awkward protrusions are overlooked. But sensors, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and techniques are improving, and success is in sight. </p>
<p>My small laboratory is in the race. In the 1980s we devised a way to distill large amounts of noisy sensor <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> into reliable maps by accumulating statistical evidence of emptiness or occupancy in each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> of a grid representing the surroundings. The approach worked well in 2D, and guides some of the robots mentioned above.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional maps, a thousand times richer, promised to be even better, but for years seemed <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally out of reach. In 1992 we found economies of scale and other tricks that reduced 3D grid costs a hundredfold, and now have a test <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that accumulates thousands of measurements from stereoscopic camera glimpses to map a room's volume down to centimeter-scale. With 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> digests over a glimpse per second, adequate for slow indoor travel. A thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> is just appearing in high-end <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s.</p>
<p>In a few years it will be found in smaller, cheaper <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s fit for robots, and we've begun an intensive three-year project to develop a prototype commercial product. Highlights are an automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> processes to optimize hundreds of evidence-weighing parameters, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s to find clear paths, locations, floors, walls, doors and other objects in the 3D maps, and sample application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s orchestrating the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> skills into tasks like delivery, floor cleaning and patrol. The initial testbed is a small mobile <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with trinocular cameras. Inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> camera chips promise to be the cheapest way to get the millions of measurements needed for dense maps.</p>
<p>As a first commercial product, we plan a basketball-sized "navigation head" for retrofit onto existing industrial vehicles. It would have multiple stereoscopic cameras, 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>, generic mapping, recognition and control <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, an application-specific <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> connection to vehicle power, controls and sensors.</p>
<p>Head-equipped vehicles with transport or patrol <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s could be taught new routes simply by leading them through once. Floor-cleaning <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s would be shown the boundaries of their work area. Introduced to a job location, the vehicles would understand their changing surroundings competently enough to work at least six months without debilitating mistakes. Ten thousand AGVs, a hundred thousand cleaning <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and, possibly, a million fork-lift trucks are candidates for retrofit, and robotization may greatly expand those markets.</p>
<p>Income and experience from spatially-aware industrial robots would <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> the stage for smarter yet cheaper ($1,000 rather than $10,000) consumer products, starting probably with small, patient <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> cleaners that automatically learn their way around a home, explore unoccupied rooms and clean whenever needed. I imagine a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> low enough to fit under some furniture, with an even lower extendible brush, that returns to a docking station to recharge and disgorge its dust load. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could open a true mass market for robots, with a hundred million potential customers.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary Speedway</h1><p>Commercial success will provoke competition and accelerate investment in manufacturing, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">Vacuum</a>ing robots should beget smarter cleaning robots with dusting, scrubbing and picking-up arms, followed by larger multifunction utility robots with stronger, more dextrous arms and better sensors. <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>s will be written to make such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s pick up clutter, store, retrieve and deliver things, take inventory, guard homes, open doors, mow lawns, play games and on.</p>
<p>New applications will expand the market and spur further advancements, when robots fall short in acuity, precision, strength, reach, dexterity, skill or processing power. Capability, numbers sold, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and manufacturing quality, and cost effectiveness will increase in a mutually reinforcing spiral. Perhaps by 2010 the process will have produced the first broadly competent "universal robots," as big as people but with lizardlike 5,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> minds that can be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med for almost any simple chore. </p>
<p>Like competent but <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>-ruled reptiles, first-generation universal robots will handle only contingencies explicitly covered in their current application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Unable to adapt to changing circumstances, they will often perform inefficiently or not at all. Still, so much physical work awaits them in businesses, streets, fields and homes that <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> could begin to overtake pure <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> commercially.</p>
<p>A second generation of universal <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with a mouselike 100,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> will adapt as the first generation does not, and even be trainable. Besides application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, the robots would host a suite of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> "conditioning modules" that generate positive and negative reinforcement signals in predefined circumstances.</p>
<p>Application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s would have alternatives for every step, small and large (grip under/over hand, work in/out doors). As jobs are repeated, alternatives that had resulted in positive reinforcement will be favored, those with negative outcomes shunned. With a well-designed conditioning suite (e.g., positive for doing a job fast, keeping the batteries charged, negative for breaking or hitting something) a second-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> will slowly learn to work increasingly well.</p>
<p>A monkeylike 5 million <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> will permit a third generation of robots to learn very quickly from mental rehearsals in simulations that model physical, cultural and psychological factors. Physical properties include shape, weight, strength, texture and appearance of things and how to handle them. Cultural aspects include a thing's name, value, proper location and purpose. Psychological factors, applied to humans and other robots, include goals, beliefs, feelings and preferences.</p>
<p>Developing the <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>s will be a huge undertaking involving thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers and experience-gathering robots. The simulation would track external events, and tune its models to keep them faithful to reality. It should let a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> learn a skill by imitation, and afford a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Asked why there are candles on the table, a third generation <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> might consult its simulation of house, owner and self to honestly reply that it put them there because its owner likes candlelit dinners and it likes to please its owner. Further queries would elicit more details about a simple inner mental <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> concerned only with concrete situations and people in its work area.</p>
<p>Fourth-generation universal robots with a humanlike 100 million <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> will be able to abstract and generalize. The first ever <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ed abstractly almost as well as people, albeit in very narrow domains, and many existing <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s outperform us. But the symbols these <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s manipulate are meaningless unless interpreted by humans. For instance, a medical diagnosis <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> needs a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> practitioner to enter a patient's symptoms, and to implement a recommended therapy.</p>
<p>Not so a third-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>, whose <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> provides a two-way conduit between symbolic descriptions and physical reality. Fourth-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s result from melding powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s to third-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. They may <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> about everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s by referring to their <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>s like Herbert Gelernter's 1959 <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> theorem prover examined analytic-<a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> "diagrams" to check special-case examples before trying to prove general geometric statements. Properly educated, the resulting robots are likely to become intellectually formidable.</p><h1>Passing the Torch</h1><p>Barring cataclysms, I consider the development of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s a near-term inevitability. Every technical step toward intelligent robots has a rough <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary counterpart, and each is likely to benefit its creators, manufacturers, and users. Each advance will provide intellectual rewards, competitive advantages, and increased wealth and options of all kinds. Each can make the world a nicer place to live. At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, by performing better and cheaper, the robots will displace humans from essential roles. Rather quickly, they could displace us from existence.</p>
<p>I'm not as alarmed as many by the latter possibility, since I consider these <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s our progeny, ``mind children'' built in our image and likeness, ourselves in more potent form. Like <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> children of previous generations, they will embody humanity's best chance for a long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. It behooves us to give them every advantage and to bow out when we can no longer contribute. </p>
<p>But, as also with <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> children, we can probably arrange for a comfortable retirement before we fade away. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> children can be convinced to care for elderly parents. Similarly, "tame" <a class="thought" href="entries/superintelligence_entry.html">superintelligence</a>s could be created and induced to protect and support us, for a while. Such relationships require advance planning and diligent maintenance: it's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to pay attention. </p>
<p>It is the ``wild'' <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s, however, those beyond our constraints, to whom the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> belongs. The available tools for peeking into that strange <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>---extrapolation, <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>---are, of course, totally inadequate. Yet, even they suggest surreal happenings.</p>
<p>Robots will sweep into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> of colonization, but their wake converts everything into increasingly pure <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> stuff. A "Mind Fire" will burn across the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Inside the Mind, physical law loses its primacy to purposes, goals, interpretations, and <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> knows what else.</p><h1>References and Acknowledgments</h1><p>Citations, expansions, illustrations and updates on <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s discussed here can be found at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194955/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm" target="_new">author's web page</a>.</p>

<b>Figure 1:</b> <i><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> in </i><a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">Robot</a><i> Spatial Awareness:</i> By 1980 the Stanford Cart had (sometimes, slowly) managed to negotiate obstacle courses by tracking and avoiding the 3D locations of a few dozen object corners in the route ahead. The top panel shows the Cart's view of a room, superimposed with red dots marking points its <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> has selected and stereoscopically ranged. The consequent 3D map at the right shows the same points, with diagonal stalks indicating height, and a planned obstacle-avoiding path. (Labels were added by hand.) The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> updated map and plan each meter of travel. The sparse maps were barely adequate, and blunders occurred every few tens of meters.</p>
<p>The second panel shows a dense 2D grid map of 150 meters of corridor produced in 1993 by a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> by Barry Brummitt controlling Carnegie Mellon's Xavier <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> via a remote Sparc 2 workstation. The sensor was a ring of sonar rangefinders, whose interpretation was automatically learned. In the map image evidence of occupancy ranges from empty (black) through unknown (gray) to occupied (white). Regular indentations marking doors are evident, also bumps where cans, water coolers, fire extinguishers, poster displays, etc. protrude. The curvature is dead-reckoning error.</p>
<p>The last panel shows work in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. As with the Cart, the left image is a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>'s eye view of a scene. The right image, though resembling a fuzzy photograph, is actually a perspective view of the occupied cells of a 3D map of the scene, built from about 100,000 range measurements extracted from 20 stereoscopic views similar to the one on the left. The grid is 256 cells wide by 256 deep by 128 high, covering 6x6x3 meters. Of the eight million total cells, about 100,000 are occupied. The realistic occupied <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> colors are a side effect of a <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process.</p>
<p>The shape of the evidence patterns corresponding to stereoscopic range values, among other <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> parameters, are tuned up automatically to make the best grids. A candidate grid is evaluated by "projecting" colors from the original images onto the grid's occupied cells from the appropriate directions. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in a perfect grid would collect colors from different views of the same thing in real <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>.</p>

<br>
<br>
Moravec presents a clear, PRACTICAL, right-thinking approach to how the next 5-10 years will play out robotically.
<br>
<br>
No mysterious quasireligious pap, no wild overestimation of human programming abilities, no broad (vague) wonders of the future theories...just an excellent clear view.
<br>
<br>
I think this article is the basis for looking at the next 5-10 years.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This is an interesting article but there is a distinct possibility that the progress as we approach human (or mammal for that matter) complexity may tail off a bit.  Its a bit easier for us to formalize what it takes to have insect or mouse intelligence.  At higher levels of complexity our ability to fully capture what intelligence is becomes less defined.  This is improving but it may not improve quite at the rate that is implied.  Make no mistake the predictions will come true and it is a pretty reasonable forecast for the next 5-10 years but the unknowns start to accumulate after that.</p></td>
