<p>19<i>.</i> David L. Parnas delivers one perspective on this topic in "Computers in Weapons: The Limits of Confidence," in David Bellin and Gary Chapman, eds., <i>Computers in Battle -Will They Work?</i> pp. 209-231<i>;</i> also of interest is a statement on <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> prospects for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> by Robert Dale, in Allen M. Din, ed., <i>Arms and </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i><i>,</i> p. 45.</p>
<p>20. This possibility may be more hypothetical than real because of the close relationship between manufacturing and services. Loss of manufacturing in key areas, for example, could be perilous to next-stage prospects for innovation. For an analysis of these and related problems, see S. S. Cohen and J. Zysman, <i>Manufacturing Matters</i>.</p>
<p>21. Translated from the Russian, "SAM" means surface-to-air missile, or literally, fixed maintenance depot to air.</p>
<p>22. See Tom Athanasiou, "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> as <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">Military</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>," in Bellin and Chapman, eds., <i>Computers in Battle.</i>
</p>
<p>23. SCI is aimed toward the use of advanced computing to develop weapons and systems "for battle management in complex environments where human decision-making [isl seen to be inadequate" (Allan M. Din, ed., <i>Arms and </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, p. 7; see also pp. <i>90-91</i> in the same volume).</p><h1>What Is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, Anyway?</h1><p>1. Similar definitions are found in many standard textbooks on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<p>2<i>.</i> This conference was originally called the Dartmouth Summer <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Project on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>; for a full account of this landmark event, see Pamela McCorduck, <i>Machines Who Think,</i> pp. 93 ff.</p>
<p>3. Norbert Weiner, the famous mathematician who coined this term (later supplanted by the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>"), was clearly fond of the meaning of its Greek root, "kubernetes": pilot or governor.</p>
<p>4. These terms were introduced by <a class="thought" href="entries/feigenbaum_entry.html">Edward Feigenbaum</a>; see his "<a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">Art</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>: Themes and Case Studies in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> Engines," in <i>AFIPS</i> <i>Conference Proceedings of the 1978 National </i><i>Computer</i><i> Conference</i> 47: 227-240.</p>

See <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a>'s defense of Darwinism in <i>The </i><i>Blind Watchmaker</i><i>: Why the Evidence of </i><i>Evolution</i><i> Reveals a </i><i>Universe</i><i> without Design;</i> for some classic arguments on design versus necessity, also see A. Hunter Dupree, in Ada Gray, ed., <i>Darwiniana,</i> pp. 51-71.</p>
<p>12. This subject is eloquently addressed in a slim volume (23 pages) by S. Alexander, <i>Art</i><i> and </i><i>Instinct</i><i>.</i>
</p>
<p>13. To some, of course, the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> is not applicable to Buddhism; see William James, <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience,</i> pp. 42-44 and 315<i>.</i>
</p>
<p>14. <a class="thought" href="entries/darwin_entry.html">Charles Darwin</a>, <i>The Origin of the </i><i>Species</i><i>.</i> In this, his classic work on natural selection and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, Darwin states, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ(ism) existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely breakdown" (p 229).</p>
<p>15. <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a>, <i>The </i><i>Blind Watchmaker</i><i>,</i> pp<i>.</i> 112-113.</p>
<p>16. Note, for example, a compelling argument against this notion (which instead champions the notion of <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>) in Stephen Jay Gould, "Is a New and General Theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> Emerging?" <i>Paleobiology</i> 6 (1979): 19-130.</p>
<p>17. See Gould, <i>Paleobiology</i> 6 (1979): 119-130. Also, in Stephen Jay Gould, <i>The Mismeasure of Man,</i> pp. 326-334, mention is made of "human <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>" in relation to the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of natural selection. See also <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a>, <i>The </i><i>Blind Watchmaker</i><i>,</i> pp. 141-142.</p>
<p>18. This idea is supported, at least in theory, by some pioneers of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>; see, for example, Lawrence Fogel, Alvin Owens, and Michael Walsh, <i>Artificial</i> <i>Intelligence</i><i> through Simulated </i><i>Evolution</i><i>,</i> pp. viii and 112.</p>
<p>19. Edward Fredkin of MIT is credited with saying, "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a> is the next step in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>" in <a class="thought" href="entries/turkle_entry.html">Sherry Turkle</a>, <i>The Second Self</i>, p. 242.</p><h1>Philosophical Roots</h1><p>1. The literature on mind as <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is extensive. One provocative work is Daniel <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Dennett's <i>Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on </i><i>Mind</i><i> and </i><i>Psychology</i><i>.</i> Dennett, a philosopher, draws upon the achievements of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> to formulate a new theory of mind. An important survey of philosophical issues can be found in <a class="thought" href="entries/boden_entry.html">Margaret Boden</a>'s <i>Artificial</i> <i>Intelligence</i><i> and Natural Man</i>, chapter 14; see also Pamela McCorduck, <i>Machines Who Think.</i> A brief, useful summary of trends is the introduction ("<a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>: Some Issues") to Steve Torrance, ed., <i>The </i><i>Mind</i><i> and the </i><i>Machine</i>: <i>Philosophical Aspects of </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i><i>.</i> For the <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> nexus, see the papers in Martin D. Ringle, ed., Philosophical <i>Perspectives in</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>. Another important source is John Haugeland, ed., <i>Mind</i><i> Design</i>. The legacy of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_body_entry.html">mind-body problem</a> is related to contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> debates in succinct, lively fashion by Paul M. Churchland in <i>Matter</i><i> and </i><i>Consciousness</i><i>.</i>
</p>
<p>2. Some theorists who have argued for the mind-beyond-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> approach are J. R. Lucas, Hubert Dreyfus, and <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a>. Lucas, in 1961, used G&#246;del's incompleteness theorem to argue that computers could never model the human mind successfully; see his "Minds, Machines and G&#246;del," <i>Philosophy</i> 36 (1961): 120-124. For a refutation of this position, see Dennett's <i>Brainstorms</i>, chapter 13. Dreyfus's famous critique of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is <i>What Computers Can't Do: The Limits of </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i>. Searle distinguishes between the capacities of "<a class="thought" href="entries/weak_ai_entry.html">weak AI</a>" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>" in his 1980 paper "Minds, Brains, and Programs," <i>The Behavioral and </i><i>Brain</i><i> Sciences</i> 3 (1980): 417-424. (Searle's paper is reprinted as chapter 10 of Haugeland's <i>Mind</i><i> Designs</i>.) Here Searle introduces his famous "<a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese room</a>" example to criticize what he sees as the "residual behaviorism" of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. A particularly useful review of criticism of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is J. Schwartz, "Limits of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>," in Stuart <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Shapiro, ed., <i>Encyclopedia of </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i><i>,</i> vol. 1. The <i>Encyclopedia</i> is an excellent general source.</p>
<p>3. See Boden's discussion, in <i>Artificial Intelligence</i><i>,</i> pp. 21-63, of Colby's attempt to develop a computational model of human emotions; on pages 440-444 she argues that emotions are not "merely" feelings; in <i>What Computers Can't Do</i>, Dreyfus argues from a phenomenological standpoint that computers can never simulate our understanding, in part because of our <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> emotions. Dennett provides an intriguing discussion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in chapter 11 ("Why You Can't Make a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> That Feels Pain") of <i>Brainstorms</i>.</p>
<p>4. According to Dreyfus in <i>What Computers Can't Do</i>, "The story of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> might well begin around 450 B.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.," when <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> expressed the idea that "all <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> must be stateable in explicit definitions which anyone could apply" (p. 67).</p>
<p>5. For an overview see D. A. Rees, "Platonism and the Platonic Tradition," <i>The Encyclopedia of </i><i>Philosophy</i><i>,</i> vol. 6, pp. 333-341 (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1967).</p>
<p>6. See Thomas L. Hankins, <i>Science</i><i> and </i><i>the Enlightenment</i>. See also Ernst Cassirer, <i>The </i><i>Philosophy</i><i> of </i><i>the Enlightenment</i><i>;</i> the first three chapters provide an important overview of the new studies of mind and how they reflected methods of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>7. See Reinhardt Grossman, <i>Phenomenology and </i><i>Existentialism</i><i>: An Introduction;</i> the critiques of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> mounted by Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus have their roots in phenomenology. Hubert Dreyfus has developed the Heideggerian notion that understanding is embedded in a world of social purpose, which cannot be adequately represented as a set of facts. Stuart Dreyfus emphasizes the importance of skills that elude representations and rules by drawing upon the existential phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty. See H. Hall, "Phenomenology," in Shapiro, <i>Encyclopedia of </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, vol. 2, pp. 730-736.</p>
<p>8. See A. J. Ayer, "Editor's Introduction," in A. J. Ayer, ed., <i>Logical Positivism</i>, pp. 3-28; Rudolf Carnap, "The Elimination of <a class="thought" href="entries/metaphysics_entry.html">Metaphysics</a> through Logical Analysis of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a>," in Ayer's <i>Logical Positivism</i>, pp. 3-81; <a class="thought" href="entries/chomsky_entry.html">Noam Chomsky</a>, <i>Syntactic Structures</i> (1957). For a review of Chomsky's achievement and influence, see Frederick J. Newmeyer's <i>Linguistic Theory in America</i>, 2nd ed., chapter 2, "The Chomskyan Revolution."</p>
<p>9. This debate, in its technical and personal dimensions, is described in some detail in McCorduck's <i>Machines Who Think.</i>
</p>
<p>10. <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s works are readily available in Greek and English in the Loeb Classical Library editions; some other English translations of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> works are mentioned below. An excellent place to begin is any of several reference works: Gilbert Ryle, "<a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>," in <i>The Encyclopedia of </i><i>Philosophy</i><i>,</i> vol. 6, pp. 324-333; D. J. Allan, "<a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>," in <i>The Dictionary of Scientific Biography, v</i>ol. 11, pp. 22-31 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1975). A more detailed account can be found in J. N. Findlay, <i>Plato</i><i> and Platonism: An Introduction.</i>
</p>
<p>11. In <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>: <i>The </i><i>Growth</i><i> and </i><i>Structure</i><i> of His </i><i>Thought</i>, chapters 2 and 3, G. E. R. Lloyd describes <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> as both a pupil and a critic of <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>.</p>
<p>12. See "The Greek Academy," in <i>The Encyclopedia of </i><i>Philosophy</i><i>,</i> vol. 3, pp. 382-385. The Academy is also treated in Ryle's "<a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>," pp. 317-319. In his excellent survey, <i>A </i><i>History</i><i> of Greek </i><i>Philosophy</i><i>,</i> vol. 4, p. 19, W. K. <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Guthrie explains that the Academy was by no means like our modern university: it had religious elements we might more readily associate with a medieval college. Volume 4 of this survey is devoted to <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>; the Academy is discussed on pp. 8-38. The early years of <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s Academy are described in the reprint edition of Eduard Zeller's 1888 classic, <i>Plato</i><i> and the Older Academy</i>. See note 17 below.</p>
<p>13. Guthrie (vol. 4, pp. 338-340) points out that <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> was influenced by the mystery religions of his day, especially in the <i>Phaedo.</i>
</p>
<p>14. <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> describes the movements of the planets in important passages in the <i>Republic and the Timaeus</i>; In <i>Plato</i><i>'s Timaeus</i>, pp. 33-35, Francis Cornford provides a useful summary of the kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> describes in the <i>Timaeus</i>. G. E. R. Lloyd has a lucid and concise discussion of <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">astronomy</a> in chapter 7 of <i>Early Greek</i> <i>Science</i><i>: </i><i>Thales</i><i> to </i><i>Aristotle</i>, pp. 80-98. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">astronomy</a>, long a controversial subject for the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, is analyzed in John D. Anton's <i>Science</i><i> and the Sciences in </i><i>Plato</i>.</p>
<p>15. The myth of Er in the <i>Republic</i> (617-618) was <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s version of a scheme originally developed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, who put fire at the extremity and at the center of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, thus displacing the earth from its central position (G. S. Kirk, J. E. Raven, and M. Schofield, <i>The Presocratic</i> <i>Philosophers,</i> p. 259). The Pythagorean <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a central fire is described by S. Sambursky in <i>The Physical</i> <i>World of the Greeks</i>, pp. 64-66.</p>
<p>16. The discovery of irrational numbers eventually resulted in the rejection of a Pythagorean "geometric atomism" and led to the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the continuum (S. Sambursky, <i>The Physical World of the Greeks</i>, pp. 33-35). In <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s <i>Theaetetus</i>, the mathematician Theodorus demonstrates the irrationality of nonsquare numbers up to the root of 17. <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> then claims that the roots of all numbers that are not squares are irrational. According to G. E. R. Lloyd (<i>Early Greek </i><i>Science</i><i>: </i><i>Thales</i><i> to </i><i>Aristotle</i>, pp. 32-34), the irrationality of the square root of 2 was known even before the time of <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>. The Greeks commonly expressed the proof in geometrical terms, by showing that the diagonal of a square is not commensurable with its side. (The proof assumes this commensurability, then shows that it leads to an impossibility because the resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> is both odd and even.) The discovery that some magnitudes are incommensurable (c. 450-441 B.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.) is attributed to Hippacos of Mepontum, a member of the Pythagorean Brotherhood, in Alexander Helleman and Bryan Bunch, <i>The Timetables of </i><i>Science</i>, p. 31.</p>
<p>17. E. R. Dodds, <i>The Greeks and the Irrational</i> is a classic treatment of this subject. <i>Ananke</i> is described in detail in F. M. Cornford, <i>Plato</i><i>'s </i><i>Cosmology</i>, pp. 159-177. A more recent work is Richard R Mohr's <i>Platonic </i><i>Cosmology</i>.</p>
<p>18. In the <i>Phaedo</i> and <i>The Republic,</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> opposes the activity of intellect to the "brutish" passivity of desire (Martha Nussbaum, "Rational Animals and the Explanation of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">Action</a>," in <i>The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and</i> <i>Ethics</i><i> in Greek Tragedy and </i><i>Philosophy</i>, p. 273). In this book Nussbaum explores the antithesis in Greek <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> between the controlling power of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> and events beyond one's control, an antithesis central to <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s dialogues.</p>
<p>19. The first mention of the Forms is in the <i>Phaedo</i>; an excellent discussion can be found in Gilbert Ryle's article (pp. 320-324) in <i>The Encyclopedia of </i><i>Philosophy</i>.</p>
<p>20. <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the <i>Timaeus,</i> where the smallest particles are triangles, is a blend of Pythagorean ideas and Democritan atomism (see S. Sambursky, <i>The Physical World of the Greeks,</i> p. 31).</p>
<p>21. Cornford, in <i>Plato</i><i>'s </i><i>Cosmology</i><i>,</i> pp<i>.</i> 159-177, provides a lucid discussion of this tension between necessity and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>.</p>

<p>23. Physicist <a class="thought" href="entries/heisenberg_entry.html">Werner Heisenberg</a> describes how he arrived at his <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a>, which he formulated in 1927 in chapter 6 of his gracefully written and entertaining volume <i>Physics</i><i> and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations.</i> Heisenberg was influenced by <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s corpuscular <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, and he explores the relation between <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s ideas and quantum theory in chapter 20, "Elementary Particles and Platonic <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> (1961-1965)."</p>
<p>24. A refreshing new interpretation of the <i>Phaedrus</i> emphasizin<i>g</i> the role of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> is Martha Nussbaum's "'This Story Isn't True': Madness, <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>, and Recantation in the <i>Phaedrus,</i>" chapter 7 in <i>The Fragility of Goodness,</i> pp<i>.</i> 200-228.</p>

It was Xenocrates, who headed the Academy after the death of Speusippus, <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s immediate successor, who identified the Platonic Ideas with mathematical numbers, not the "ideal" numbers postulated in the Academy under <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> and discussed in the <i>Phaedo</i>. The fates of the various forms of Platonism are reviewed in several brief articles in the <i>Dictionary of the </i><i>History</i><i> of Ideas</i> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973), vol. 3: John Fisher's "Platonism in <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/poetry_entry.html">Poetry</a>," pp. 502-508; John Charles Nelson's "Platonism in the <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">Renaissance</a>," pp. 508-515; and Ernst Moritz Manasse's "Platonism since <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a>," pp. 515-525.</p>

Tutelage is the inability to use one's understanding without the guidance of another person. This tutelage is self-incurred if its cause lies not in any weakness of the understanding, but in indecision and lack of courage to use the mind without the guidance of another.

<p>42. Ayer, in <i>Logical Positivism</i>, p. 11, points out the positivist <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of Hume's attack on <a class="thought" href="entries/metaphysics_entry.html">metaphysics</a> and then claims that he could well have cited Kant instead, "who maintained that human understanding lost itself in contradictions when it ventured beyond the bounds of possible <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>." Ayer claims that "the originality of the logical positivists lay in their making the impossibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/metaphysics_entry.html">metaphysics</a> depend not upon the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of what could be known but upon the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of what could be said" (<i>Logical Positivism</i>, p. 11).</p>

<p>53. Michael Dummett, in his "Frege and Wittgenstein" (in Irving Block, ed., <i>Perspectives on the</i> <i>Philosophy</i><i> of Wittgenstein</i>, pp. 31-42), argues that Wittgenstein tried and failed to provide a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> in <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>.</p>
<p>54. In the preface to <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> (p. vi), Wittgenstein claims that he recognized "grave mistakes" in his earlier work, the <i>Tractatus</i>. The more atomistic approach of the latter is challenged by a greater emphasis on contexts in <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. Anthony Kenny compares the two works in "Wittgenstein's Early <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a>," Block, ed., <i>Perspectives</i>, pp. 140-147.

<p>59. Pamela McCorduck, <i>Machines Who Think</i>, p. 204. McCorduck devotes chapter 9 ("L'Affair Dreyfus") to an engaging <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of Dreyfus's critique and the reactions it provoked in the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community.</p>
<p>60. <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> was first announced in Joseph Weizenbaum's "<a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a>-A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> for the Study of <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">Natural Language</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> between Man and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>," <i>Communications of the Association for</i> <i>Computing</i> <i>Machinery</i> 9 (1966): 36-45. Hubert Dreyfus stumped <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> by entering the phrase "I'm feeling happy," and then correcting it, by adding "No, elated." <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> responded with "Don't be so negative," because it is programmed to respond that way whenever "no" appears anywhere in the input. See Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus, "Why Computers May Never Think like People," <i>Technology</i><i> Review</i> 89 (1986): 42-61.</p>
<p>61. <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> mimics a Rogerian psychotherapist, whose technique consists largely of echoing utterances of the patient; it therefore uses very little <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and arrives at its "answers" by combining transformations of the "input" sentences with phrases stored under keywords. Its profound limitations were acknowledged by its creator. In his 1976 work, <i>Computer</i><i> Power and </i><i>Human</i><i> </i><i>Reason</i>, Weizenbaum argues that <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a>'s limitations serve to illustrate the importance of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding, a point made in his original paper. He chose this kind of psychotherapeutic dialog precisely because the psychotherapist in such a dialog need know practically nothing about the real world. See <a class="thought" href="entries/boden_entry.html">Margaret Boden</a>, <i>Artificial</i> <i>Intelligence</i><i> and Natural Man</i>, p. 108.</p>
<p>62. Dreyfus developed this argument in detail in <i>What Computers Can't Do:</i> <i>The Limits of Artificial</i> <i>Intelligence</i><i>.</i> There he sets out objections to "the assumption that man functions like a general-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>-manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>" (p. 156). Especially drawing his ire was the work of Allen Newell and H. A. Simon, <i>Computer</i><i> Simulation of </i><i>Human</i> <i>Thinking</i><i>,</i> The RAND Corporation, P-2276 (April 1961).</p>
<p>63. <a class="thought" href="entries/prolog_entry.html">PROLOG</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> based upon logic programming, was devised by Colmerauer at Marseille around 1970 (see W.

<p>68. <i>In What Computers Can't</i> <i>Do</i> Dreyfus argues, "There is no justification for the assumption that we first <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> isolated facts, or snapshots of facts, or momentary views of snapshots of isolated facts, and then give them significance. The analytical superfluousness of such a process is what contemporary philosophers such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein are trying to point out" (p. 270).</p>

Jacquet-Droz's son, Henri-Louis, created a mechanical artist that drew flowers and a musician that played a clavecin. He also made a pair of artificial hands for a general's son, who had lost his own hands in a hunting accident. Henri-Louis's success in this venture was praised by the great creator of automata Jacques de Vaucanson (1709-1782). See the entries for Pierre-Jacquet Droz and Henri-Louis-Jacquet Droz in <i>Nouvelle Biographie G&#233;n&#233;rale</i>, vol. 14 (Paris: Didot, 1868), pp. 812-813.

Von Neumann stressed the differences between the nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in "The General and Logical Theory of Automata," in L. A. Jeffress, ed., <i>Cerebral</i> <i>Mechanisms in Behavior</i> (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1951). He fails to see how these two can be made to be functionally equivalent.</p>

Hubel and Wiesel are responsible for many important aspects of our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> today about the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mechanisms for vision. They conducted many imaginative experiments to reveal the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and functional decomposition of the cortex. Notable is their discovery of the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/edge_detection_entry.html">edge detection</a> neurons. See D. H. Hubel and T. N.

<p>14. David Marr is brilliant at fusing studies from <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> vision. His highly influential classic, published posthumously, is <i>Vision</i>. A paper that excellently summarizes and demonstrates his computational approach to vision is D. Marr and H. K. Nishihara, "Visual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Processing: <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> and the Sensorium of Sight," <i>Technology</i><i> Review,</i> October 1978.</p>

<p>16. The <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> of stereopsis and stereo vision is discussed well in S. T. Barnard and M. A. Fischler, "Computational Stereo from an IU Perspective," <i>Proceedings of the Image Understanding Workshop</i>, 1981.</p>
<p>17. Edges introduce constraints that greatly reduce the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of ways two images can be fused. Without such preprocessing, matching would be extremely difficult. Consider, for example, the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of fusing random-dot stereograms. See David Marr, <i>Vision</i>, p. 9.</p>

<p>19. See W. Eric L. Crimson, <i>From Images to Surfaces.</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">Object</a> recognition and labeling is a hard problem.

<p>20. The parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the computational processes constituting early vision is examined in an excellent review article: <a class="thought" href="entries/poggio_entry.html">Tomaso Poggio</a>, Vincent Torre, and Christof Koch, "Computational Vision and Regularization Theory," <i>Nature</i>, September 26, 1985. The role of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computations is also discussed there.</p>

<p>25. Neural networks and related mechanisms have been applied fairly successfully in vision problems. For work in early vision, see D. H. Ballard, "<a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">Parameter</a> Nets: Toward a Theory of Low-Level Vision," <i>Artificial Intelligence</i><i> Journal</i> 22 (1984): 235-267. For higher-level processes, see D. Sabbah, "Computing with Connections in Visual Recognition of Origami Objects," <i>Cognitive Science</i> 9 (1985): 25-50.</p>
<p>26. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, early neural networks failed to determine connectedness of drawings. The ability of more complex neural nets to determine connectedness remains controversial. See <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> and Seymour Papert, <i>Perceptrons</i>, pp. 136-150.</p>

The manifesto of the new connectionists is <i>Parallel</i> <i>Distributed Processing,</i> vols. 1 and 2, by David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Group. Chapter 2 of this book describes the new neural-net structures.</p>
<p>28. <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> and Seymour Papert, <i>Perceptrons</i>, revised ed., p. vii.</p>
<p>29. Distributed systems, whose mechanisms and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> are stored not centrally but over a large space, are less prone to catastrophic degradation. Neural networks are not only parallel but also distributed systems. See chapter 1 of D. E. Rumelhart, J. L. McClelland, and the PDP <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Group, <i>Parallel</i> <i>Distributed Processing: Explorations in the</i> <i>Microstructure of Cognition</i>, vol. 1.</p>
<p>30. An excellent study of skill acquisition with some implications for parallel distributed processing is D. E. Rumelhart and D. A. Norman, "Simulating a Skilled Typist: A Study of Skilled Cognitive-Motor Performance," Institute for <a class="thought" href="entries/cognitive_science_entry.html">Cognitive Science</a>, technical report 8102, University of California, San Diego, 1981.</p>
<p>31. This objection is articulated in Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus, <i>Mind</i><i> Over </i><i>Machine</i><i>: The Power of </i><i>Human</i><i> </i><i>Intuition</i><i> and Expertise in the Era of the </i><i>Computer</i> (New York: The Free Press, 1986), pp. 101-121.</p>
<p>32. <a class="thought" href="entries/hillis_entry.html">Daniel Hillis</a> points out that for many physical systems that are inherently parallel, fluid flow, for example, it is simply not convenient to think in terms of sequential processes. Similarly, logic turns out to be inconvenient for the analysis of, say, early-vision processes. See W. <a class="thought" href="entries/hillis_entry.html">Daniel Hillis</a>, "The <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a>," <i>Scientific American</i>, June 1987.</p>
<p>33. This multilevel, multiparadigm approach is followed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> theory of the mind. See <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, <i>The </i><i>Society of Mind</i><i>.</i>
</p>
<p>34. Higher-level descriptions have a smaller volume of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, but they incorporate a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of constraints and require more extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the physical world. See chapter 1 in David Marr, <i>Vision.</i>

<p>39. <a class="thought" href="entries/hillis_entry.html">Daniel Hillis</a>'s thesis suggests areas where parallelism ought to be exploited. See W. <a class="thought" href="entries/hillis_entry.html">Daniel Hillis</a>, <i>The Connection</i> <i>Machine</i> (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1985).</p>
<p>40. David Marr is responsible for these important representations for vision processing. All three are clearly explained in D. Marr and H. K. Nishihara, "Visual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Processing: <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> and the Sensorium of Sight," <i>Technology</i><i> Review</i>, October 1978.</p>
<p>41. <a class="thought" href="entries/segmentation_entry.html">Segmentation</a> was one of the chief concerns in the construction of the Hearsay speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.

<p>43. The early years of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> saw a lot of work on character recognition. But researchers could not perform extensive experiments on their programs because of a lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power. See W. W. Bledsoe and I. Browning, "<a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">Pattern Recognition</a> and Reading by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>," <i>Proceedings of the Eastern Joint </i><i>Computer</i><i> Conference</i>, 1959.

Franklin, Laura Davis, Randall Shumaker, and Paul Morawski, "<a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">Military</a> Applications," in Stuart Shapiro ed., <i>Encyclopedia of </i><i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, vol. 1 (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1987).</p>
<p>61. The <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of remotely piloted aircraft offers great possibilities, as one can see from Peter Gwynne, "Remotely Piloted Vehicles Join the Service," <i>High </i><i>Technology</i>, January 1987, pp. 38-43.</p>
<p>62. Expert systems, <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> and other kinds of medical-<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> systems will become increasingly utilized in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>.

<p>65. To J. B. Watson, the founder of behaviorism in America, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> was like talking to oneself. He attached great importance to the small movements of the tongue and larynx when one is <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. See J. B. Watson, <i>Behaviorism</i> (New York: Norton, 1925).</p>
<p>66. Viewers of the film <i>My Fair Lady</i> will recall that the anatomy of speech production is an important topic for phoneticians. See M. Kenstowicz and <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Kissebereth, <i>Generative Phonology: Description and Theory</i> (New York: Academic Press, 1979) and P.

<p>4. The successes and limitations of these systems are discussed in the excellent book Lynn Margulus and Karlene Schwartz, <i>Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla</i> <i>of </i><i>Life</i><i> on </i><i>Earth</i>, 2nd ed. (New York: W. H. Freeman, 1988).</p>
<p>5. Dewey first published his classic work anonymously under the title, "A <a class="thought" href="entries/classification_entry.html">Classification</a> and Subject Title." Many editions have appeared since, because the Dewey <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has grown to meet every challenge of the world's libraries. See Melvil Dewey, <i>Dewey Decimal Classification and Relative Index: Devised by Melvil Dewey</i>, 19th ed., edited under the direction of Benjamin Custer (Albany, N.Y.: Forest Press, 1979).</p>
<p>6. Ross Quillian is generally credited with developing semantic networks as a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">knowledge representation</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> systems. Although he introduced this representation as early as 1963, the standard reference for his work in this area is M. Ross Quillian, "Semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a>," in <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, <i>Semantic </i><i>Information</i><i> Processing</i> (1968).</p>

<p>9. Some interesting explanations of cognitive dissonance are given in Henry Gleitman, <i>Psychology</i>, 2nd ed. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1986), pp. 374-376.</p>
<p>10. An excellent book on the influence of media on political <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, <i>The Spot: The Rise of Political </i><i>Advertising</i><i> on Television</i> (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1984).</p>
<p>11. A revealing book on the psychological aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">advertising</a> today is William Meyers, <i>The Image Makers: Power and Persuasion on Madison Avenue</i> (New York: Times Books, 1984).</p>
<p>12. Much <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> has been done in recent years on the mechanisms for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> in the human brain, particularly since any new <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> could contribute significantly to the debate on <a class="thought" href="entries/connectionism_entry.html">connectionism</a>. An introductory account is in Paul M. Churchland, <i>Matter</i><i> and </i><i>Consciousness</i><i>,</i> revised edition.</p>
<p>13. This last point is strongly brought out by <a class="thought" href="entries/schank_entry.html">Roger Schank</a> and Peter Childers in <i>The Creative Attitude</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1988).</p>
<p>14. That computers can never be creative has long been an argument against the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. A short rebuttal and an examination of what it means to be creative appears as part of <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, "Why People Think Computers Can't" <i>A1 Magazine</i> 3, no. 4 (Fall 1982).</p>

<p>19. See Eliot Hearst, "Man and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>."</p>
<p>20. Newell and his associates maintain that much of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> is reorganization of certain memories into efficient "chunks." See John E. Laird, P. Rosenbloom, and Allen Newell, "Toward Chunking as a General <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> Mechanism," <i>Proceedings of the National Conference of the American Association for Artificial</i> <i>Intelligence</i><i>,</i> Austin, Tex, 1984.</p>

<p>22. An excellent introductory book on the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and design of expert systems, with contributions from many figures notable for their work in this area, is Frederick Hayes-Roth, D. A. Waterman, and D. B. Lenat, eds., <i>Building Expert Systems.</i>

<p>25. Many techniques were introduced to handle the uncertainty of propositions that an <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> is asked to deal with. <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">Fuzzy logic</a> is one such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. See Lofti Zadeh, "<a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">Fuzzy Logic</a> and Approximate Reasoning," <i>Synthese 30</i> (1975): 407-428. Zadeh's <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a> has a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of limitations, and other systems for uncertainty have grown in popularity.

<p>31. The results of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> project at Stanford have been very influential on current <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>.

<p>35. The <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> originally appeared as Edward Shortliffe's doctoral dissertation in 1974. Other Stanford dissertations explored further the broad concepts behind <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> and produced some important tools and applications. Randall Davis's TEIRESIAS, an interactive tool to help the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> engineer <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> expertise, is presented in Randall Davis, "Applications of Meta-Level <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> to the Construction, Maintenance, and Use of Large <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> Bases," Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford University, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory, 1976. William van Melle succeeded in showing that in keeping with the conceptual framework proposed earlier by Feigenbaum et al., the inference <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> could in fact be separated out. Van Melle's <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, EMYCIN, represented the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of inferences and reasoning in <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a>.

<p>55. This is not surprising, since <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is a principle means of expressing <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. The entire field of psycholinguistics is devoted to studying the connection between <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. So strong is the appeal of this connection that some believe the Whorfian <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>, which, loosely stated, holds that there can be no <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> without <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. Others accept a much weaker form of the Whorfian <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>: that there has to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that is not necessarily the same as one's spoken <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> See J.

<p>77. Fully automatic factories are unusual today. More common are plants whose organization and <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> rely significantly on robotic machinery, while human workers handle other important operations. The <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of such production units is realistically described in Christopher Joyce, "Factories Will Measure As They Make," <i>New Scientist</i>, September 4, 1986.</p>
<p>78. What will the factory of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> be like? Some analyses are put forward in Philippe Millers, "Intelligent Robots: Moving Toward Megassembly," and Paul Russo, "Intelligent Robots: Myth or <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">Reality</a>."

</p>
<p>17. Advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics are occurring at a rapid rate, and the literature is vast. Several important sources of up-to-date <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> are the <i>ACM Transactions on</i> <i>Graphics, </i><i>Computer</i><i> Graphics, Quarterly Report of the ACM Special Interest Group of</i> <i>Graphics, </i><i>Computer</i><i> Graphics World</i>, and articles on <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics in <i>Byte</i><i>.</i> Melvin L. Prueitt's <i>Art</i><i> and the </i><i>Computer</i> has dazzling pictures produced using a wide variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-graphics techniques and includes a series of examples of art produced on personal computers (see pp. 29 and 191-194). A review of the early <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics, complete with illustrations, is provided by H. W. Francke in <i>Computer</i><i> Graphics-</i><i>Computer</i><i> </i><i>Art</i>, pp. 57-105. Examples of practical applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics are found in Donald Greenberg, Aaron Marcus, Allen H. Schmidt, and Vernon Gorter, <i>The </i><i>Computer</i><i> Image: Applications of </i><i>Computer</i><i> Graphics</i>. The shift from fixed images to the modern transformable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> image has stimulated a new analytical approach to graphics, exemplified by Jacques Bertin, <i>Semiology of Graphics</i>, trans. William J. Berg.</p>
<p>18. Recent developments in color-graphics displays are described in H. John Durrett, ed., <i>Color and the </i><i>Computer</i>. Chapter 12 reviews the available <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for color hard-copy devices, and there are also chapters on color in medical images, cartography, and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> applications.</p>
<p>19. Many of these techniques are described and illustrated in Prueitt, <i>Art</i> <i>and the </i><i>Computer</i><i>.</i> Some of the extraordinary achievements in rendering reflection are illustrated on pp. 144-150, and an example of the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of natural and artificial scenes can be found on p. 29. An excellent example of distortion is provided by plates E to J of Foley and Van Dam, <i>Fundamentals of Interactive </i><i>Computer</i><i> Graphics</i>, which illustrate the mapping of images of a mandrill onto a series of different geometric shapes. Chapter 14 of that work provides a description of techniques being used to enhance the realism of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> imagery.</p>
<p>20. Those interested in the technical aspects of image transformation should consult chapter 8 of Foley and Van Dam, <i>Fundamentals of Interactive </i><i>Computer</i><i> Graphics.</i>
</p>
<p>21. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> artists active during the 1970s describe their relations to their chosen medium in Ruth Leavitt, <i>Artist and </i><i>Computer</i>. When asked if his work could be done without the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> artist Aldo Giorgini said, "Yes, in a fashion analogous to the one of carving marble with a sponge" (p. 12).</p>
<p>22. The game of life was invented by John Conway in 1970 and is one example of a cellular automaton. As Tommaso Toffoli and Norman Margolis point out, "A <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>." See their <i>Cellular Automata</i><i> Machines: A New Environment for Modeling,</i> p. 1. An entertaining explanation of games of life can be found in chapter 7 of Ivars Peterson, <i>The Mathematical Tourist: Snapshots of Modern</i> <i>Mathematics</i>. See also A. K. Dewdney, <i>The Armchair </i><i>Universe</i><i>,</i>  "World Four: <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> in Automata." Dewdney explores the concepts of one-dimensional computers and threedimensional life. Chapter 25 in Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, <i>Winning Ways for Your</i> <i>Mathematical Plays,</i> is devoted to games of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. On page 830 the authors describe how to make a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>: "Many computers have been programmed to play the game of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. We shall now return the compliment by showing how to define <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> patterns that can imitate computers." See, as well, William Poundstone, <i>The Recursive </i><i>Universe</i><i>: Cosmic </i><i>Complexity</i><i> and the Limits of Scientific</i> <i>Knowledge</i>, chapters 11 and 12 and the section "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> for Home Computers."</p>
<p>23. See <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a>'s 1987 work <i>The </i><i>Blind Watchmaker</i><i>.</i> Dawkins devised a simple model for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>; starting with a stick figure, his <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> produces more and more complex figures often resembling actual natural shapes, such as insects. Sixteen numbers function as "genes" and determine the resulting forms, or "biomorphs."</p>
<p>24. In Dawkins's scheme, the human observer provides the natural selection, choosing "mutations" that will "survive." An artist could use aesthetic criteria to determine the direction of "<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>." A. K. Dewdney describes Dawkins's <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, which runs on the Mac, in "A <a class="thought" href="entries/blind_watchmaker_entry.html">Blind Watchmaker</a> Surveys the Land of Biomorphs," <i>Scientific American</i>, February 1988, pp. 128-131.</p>

<p>26. An account of Mandelbrot's eclectic career and his discovery of the "<a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>" can be found in James Gleick, <i>Chaos</i><i>: Making a New </i><i>Science</i>, pp. 81-118. The bible of <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is Benoit Mandelbrot, <i>The </i><i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i> of </i><i>Nature</i> (1983). This work superseded Mandelbrot's earlier volume <i>Fractals: Form,</i> <i>Chance, and Dimension</i>. Images produced by fractals are described and illustrated in the classic work by H.-0. Peitgen and P. H. Richter, <i>The </i><i>Beauty</i><i> of Fractals: Images of Complex</i> <i>Dynamical Systems</i>. Peitgen and Richter devoted themselves to the study of the Mandelbrot set and produced spectacular pictures, which they published and displayed (see Gleick, <i>Chaos</i><i>,</i> pp, 229 ff).</p>
<p>27. See pp. 213-240 in Gleick's <i>Chaos</i><i>.</i> Chaotic-<a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> evolutions are discussed in chapter 20 of Mandelbrot's <i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i>.</i>

<p>31. "One should not be surprised that scaling fractals should be limited to providing first approximations of the natural shapes to be tackled. One must rather marvel that these first approximations are so strikingly reasonable" (Mandelbrot, <i>The </i><i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i> of</i> <i>Nature</i>, p. 19.) In "The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> as Microscope," in <i>The Mathematical Tourist,</i> Peterson points out that "natural fractals are often self-similar in a statistical sense" (p. 119). See also pp. 155-164.</p>
<p>32. "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> graphics provides a convenient way of picturing and exploring <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> objects, and <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is a useful tool for creating <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> images" (Peterson, <i>The Mathematical Tourist,</i> p. 123.)</p>
<p>33.

<p>34. Mandelbrot's discussion of the etymology is in <i>The </i><i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i> of </i><i>Nature</i>, pp. 4-5.</p>
<p>35. The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of dimensionality is central to an understanding of fractals and to an understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.

</p>
<p>36. See Mandelbrot, "Index of Selected Dimensions," in <i>Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension,</i> p. 365, where the seacoast dimension is given as 1.25. Mandelbrot devotes chapter 6 of <i>The </i><i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i> of </i><i>Nature</i> to "Snowflakes and Other Koch Curves." In "The Koch Curve Tamed" he gives its <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> dimension as 1.2618 (p. 36). Peterson describes the Koch curve, created in 1904, in <i>The Mathematical Tourist</i>, pp. 116-119.</p>

<p>38. See Mandelbrot on <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> art, pp. 23-24 of <i>The </i><i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i> of </i><i>Nature</i>. He points out that the images created by fractals may be reminiscent of the work of M. <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Escher because Escher was influenced by hyperbolic tilings, which are related to <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> shapes (p. 23). Mandelbrot also suggests that the work of certain great artists of the past, when it illustrated <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, exemplified "issues tackled by <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>": the examples are the frontispiece of <i>Bible moralis&#233;e illustr&#233;es</i>, Leonardo's <i>Deluge</i>, and Hokusai's <i>Great </i><i>Wave</i> (see pp. C1, 2, 3, 16). Some striking examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> images are described and illustrated in Prueitt's <i>Art</i> <i>and the </i><i>Computer</i> (pp. 119, 121-124, 127, 166, 169). Alan Norton has produced beautiful and bizarre complex shapes by generating and displaying geometric fractals in three dimensions (see Prueitt, pp. 123-124). For images that resemble natural landscapes, see plates C9, C11, C13, and C15 in Mandelbrot's <i>Fractal</i><i> </i><i>Geometry</i><i> of</i> <i>Nature</i><i>.</i> Mandelbrot himself claims that these artificial landscapes are the <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> equivalent of the "complete <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of hemoglobin from the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> atoms and (a great deal of) time and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>" (p.

<p>48. In the Introduction to <a class="thought" href="entries/racter_entry.html">RACTER</a>, <i>The Policeman's Beard is Half-Constructed,</i> William Chamberlain describes the process behind <a class="thought" href="entries/racter_entry.html">RACTER</a>'s prose: certain rules of English are entered into the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and what the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> produces is based upon the words it finds in its files, which are then combined according to "<a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> directives." Chamberlain concludes that this process "seems to spin a thread of what might initially pass for coherent <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-generated copy so that once the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is run, its output is not only new and unknowable, it is apparently thoughtful. It is crazy '<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>' I grant you, but '<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>' that is expressed in perfect English." See the discussion by A. K. Dewdney, "Conversations with <a class="thought" href="entries/racter_entry.html">RACTER</a>," in <i>The Armchair</i> <i>Universe</i>, pp. 77-88.
