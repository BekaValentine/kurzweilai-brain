<div class="TeaserText">Bill Gates envisions the next-generation Internet as a single, unified interface to information instantly available to you anywhere, any time.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published 2000 (shorter version) in The Economist. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>If anything is moving at "<a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> speed" at the start of the new millennium, it is the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> itself. No <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has established itself so rapidly in the marketplace.</p>
<p>On average, it took the telephone around 40 years to reach a quarter of the population in developed countries. Today, only five years after most consumers learned of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>'s existence, it has already raced past that milestone in many nations. In the U.S., 40% of the population now uses the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, while in Iceland, Singapore, New Zealand and some Scandinavian countries, more than 50% does so.</p>
<p>We may be a long way from bridging the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> divide, but <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is amazing: In 2001 more than 400 million people worldwide will surf the Web's four billion pages and, according to IDC, spend half a trillion dollars on goods and services in the process. The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is already revolutionizing the way we live, work, learn, shop and play.</p>
<p>Yet for all its wonders, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is today roughly where the automobile was when Henry Ford launched his Model T. Both the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and the PCs we use to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> it represent a big advance on the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>--computing's horse and buggy era--but <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> still has a long way to go.</p>
<p>In many respects, today's <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> actually mirrors the old <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> model, with the <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a> playing the role of "dumb terminal." All the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> you want is located in centralized <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s, and served up a page at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (from a single Web site at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) to individual users. Web pages are simply an <a class="thought" href="entries/html_entry.html">HTML</a> "picture" of the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> you need, not the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> itself. You can look but you can't touch-editing, annotating or otherwise customizing the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is hard to do because it wasn't designed to make that possible. If you want to pull together <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from multiple Web sites, you often end up scribbling it down on a notepad.</p>
<p>That's a long way from the "intercreative <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>" envisioned by <a class="thought" href="entries/berners-lee_entry.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, whose pioneering work lead to the creation of the Web. The structure of today's <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> also makes exchanging <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>--whether a transaction between businesses or personal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s--incredibly complex.</p>
<p>Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> can in theory be <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, any place and from any intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, it looks tailor-made to act as a global exchange mechanism for any kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. But because the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on today's Web sites isn't fully <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible by other sites, applications or <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, the reality is a Web of isolated islands of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that can't collaborate with each other in any useful way. And each new way to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--tablet PCs, Web-enabled TVs and cellphones, smart pagers--adds another layer of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> users end up living in several separate worlds: the worlds of applications on PCs, of various kinds of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, and of Web sites themselves.</p>
<p>To transform itself into more than a medium that simply presents static <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, the next generation <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> needs to solve these problems. Instead of being made up of isolated islands where the user often provides the only integration, it must enable constellations of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and Web-based services to collaborate seamlessly. It must help businesses offer products and services in ways that let their customers customize them according to their needs. It must offer individuals complete control over how, when and what <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is delivered to them, and allow them to protect their privacy and security by controlling who has <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to their personal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>At the core of that transformation is <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">Extensible Markup Language</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a>. An open industry standard defined by the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> Consortium (with extensive input from <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> and other high-tech companies), <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a> offers a way to separate a Web page's underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from the presentational view of that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. It works in a similar way to <a class="thought" href="entries/html_entry.html">HyperText Markup Language</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/html_entry.html">HTML</a>), which uses "tags" to defines how <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is displayed on today's Web pages. <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a> uses tags to provide a common way of defining precisely what the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> actually is.</p>
<p>The effect of this technological lingua franca on the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> will be far-reaching. <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a> "unlocks" <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> so that it can be organized, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med, edited and exchanged with other sites, applications and <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. In effect, it turns every Web page into a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable mini-<a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> (so you can actually analyze those stock price statistics you find on the Web without having to cut-and-paste them into a spreadsheet first).</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a> enables different Web sites to share all kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> without having to use the same <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_language_entry.html">computer language</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> application. Individual Web sites can collaborate to provide a variety of Web-based services that can interact intelligently with each other. And <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can move from one <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> to another without the need for today's separate applications, with their widely varying <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s, functionality and (in)compatibility.</p>
<p>The next generation <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> will be a computing and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> in the same way that the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> is. <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>s "written to" the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> (just as they are written to the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>) will run across multiple Web sites, drawing on <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and services from each of them, and combining and delivering them in customized form to any <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> you like.</p>
<p>The distinction between the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> or other <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will break down--advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> (like that at the heart of <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>'s .NET initiative) will automatically determine whether the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, applications or services you need are available locally or remotely, then bring them together to best serve your needs.</p>
<p>As the barriers between online <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, services and <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s break down, how you interact with them will also be revolutionized. Today, you use separate <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> applications for every computing task you want to perform, whether it's browsing the Web, writing and editing, e-mail and instant messaging, your calendar and contacts.</p>
<p>The next generation <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> will enable a more integrated approach. You'll use a single, unified <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> that moves transparently between the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> you are using, allowing you to browse, write, edit, schedule, communicate or analyze <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. I see it as a "universal canvas" for the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> Age.</p>
<p>You'll also interact with your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in many more ways. Today, the amount of email I receive that has handwriting or voice annotation is negligible. In <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, the majority of messages will come in some form other than typed text. Today, you always know whether you're on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> or on your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>'s hard drive.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, you won't care and you may not even know. Everything on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, your local intranet, your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> and other <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will be available as potential "building blocks" for a new generation of Web-based services. Your business and personal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> will be securely stored on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, automatically synchronized and instantly available to you and the Web-based services you need--no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> where you are, what you are doing, or what <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> you are using.</p>
<p>Everything that can think will link--transparently and automatically. So if you are traveling and need medical attention, your personal physician service will be able to locate the best local doctor, make an appointment that fits into your schedule, share the appropriate medical records and arrange payment. All you'll need to do is give your permission.</p>
<p>Think of it as a "personal Web," intelligently acting on you and your family's behalf. Think of it as the ultimate business tool, boosting your firm's <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a>, cutting costs, streamlining transactions, vastly increasing the range of services it can offer, and taking a big step closer to friction-free <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a>.</p>
<p>Just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of musical notation made the orchestration of <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s possible, the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a> and advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is making the orchestration of online and offline <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and services a reality--and revolutionizing computing and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s during the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The next generation <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> will look a lot like today's <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--but under the hood the two will have as much in common as today's automobiles have with Ford's flivver.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The ultimate interface to uncategorised, and thus 'uneconomic' information about the reality into which one may choose to move, will always be the people who live that reality ...
<br>
The motivation to collect or collate or associate that 'uneconomic' information has always intrigued me ...
<br>
I see no implication  of an answer yet - only desire leads to TheBrain .. the economy of TheBrain, or such, has yet to be percieved by the economists it seems.
<br>
Too complex ?

Nice to read Bill's thoughts ...
