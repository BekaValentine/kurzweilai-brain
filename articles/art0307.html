<div class="TeaserText">From <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s revolutionary book <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">The Age of Intelligent Machines</a>, published in 1990.</div>

<br>
<blockquote>The great discovery of the twentieth century in art and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> alike, is a recoil from and transformation of the impersonal assembly-line of nineteenth century art and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Marshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">Galaxy</a>
</blockquote><h1>The Musical Arts</h1><blockquote>At a time like ours, in which mechanical skill has attained unsuspected perfection, the most famous works may be heard as easily as one may drink a glass of beer, and it only costs ten centimes, like the automatic weighing machines. Should we not fear this domestication of sound, this magic that anyone can bring from a disk at his will? Will it not bring to waste the mysterious force of an art which one might have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> indestructible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Claude Debussy, <i>La Revue S.I.M.</i> (1913)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Collaboration with machines! What is the difference between manipulation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and collaboration with it? I have sometimes experienced a state of dynamic tension rising in me out of what would seem to be a state of mutual responsiveness between the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and myself. Such a state could require hours of concentrated preparatory exploration, coaxing of machines, connecting, so to say, one's own sensibilities, one's own nerve endings to the totality of the tuned-up controls. And, suddenly, a window would open into a vast field of possibilities; the time limits would vanish, and the machines would seem to become humanized components of the interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> now consisting of oneself and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, still obedient but full of suggestions to the master controls of the <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. Everything seemed possible: one leaned on the horizon and pushed it away and forward until utter exhaustion would set in and, one by one, the nerve endings ceased to connect, the possibilities contracted, and an automatic reversal to routine solutions was a sure danger signal to quit. An affectionate pat on a control here and there was not to be resisted. Switches and lights off! If there is an unfinished bit of <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> between you and the machines, either take note of all the controls or leave them alone until tomorrow. Recapturing the exact circumstances of such periods as just described is not easy. Tomorrow it may seem all cold steel, copper and colored plastic. The coaxing may have to start all over again.</blockquote>

<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is now having a major impact on all fields, including the creative arts. While the visual arts are just beginning to feel the impact of advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics and imaging technologies, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> revolution in music is already well under way.<sup>1</sup> One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that the transformation of music is further along has to do with the substantially greater "<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>" (<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>) required for images as compared to sounds. With <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> we can already store, analyze, modify, and recreate sounds with an accuracy equal to that of the human auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.<sup>2</sup> To do the same with visual images requires an amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and processing power that is still quite challenging for today's computers. Another <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> has to do with the fact that music theory is more highly developed and quantitative than theory in the visual arts.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, a historic transformation is taking place in the musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> industry away from the acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the piano and violin and toward the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>.<sup>3</sup> The advent and now enthusiastic acceptance of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> instruments follows a long tradition. <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> has always used the most advanced technologies available: the cabinet-making crafts of the eighteenth century, the metalworking industries of the nineteenth century, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> electronics of the 1960s. This latest wave-the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> electronics and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> of the 1980s-is again making historic changes in the way music is created.</p>
<p>Up until recently, <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>-playing technique was inextricably linked to the sounds created. If you wanted flute sounds, you had to use flute-playing technique. The playing techniques derived from the physical requirements of creating the sounds. Now that link has been broken. If you like flute-playing technique (or just happened to have learned it), you can now use an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> wind controller that plays very much like an acoustic flute yet creates the sounds not only of the flute but also of virtually any other <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, acoustic or <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>. In fact, there are now controllers that emulate the playing technique of most popular acoustic instruments, including piano, violin, guitar, drums, and a variety of wind instruments. Since we are no longer linked to the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of creating sounds acoustically, a new generation of controllers is emerging that bears no resemblance to any conventional acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> but instead attempts to optimize the human factors of creating music with our fingers, arms, feet, mouth, and head.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> controllers and sound generators (or synthesizers) can be linked together by an industry-standard <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">Musical Instrument</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">Interface</a>).<sup>4</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a>, which employs an inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> link, has allowed independently developed synthesizers, controllers, sequencers (computerbased devices that can remember and replay sequences of notes), and other sound modification devices to communicate and interact with each other. <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> has even been used to control stage lighting and other visual effects. Another industry protocol called SMPTE <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">Code</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">Motion</a> Picture and Television Engineers) allows interfacing sound-manipulating devices to video. <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> and SMPTE <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">Code</a> together are facilitating the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based systems that are revolutionizing video and audio production in the same way that <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> publishing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, personal computers, and laser printers have transformed the way printed documents are created.</p>
<p>In addition to new music controllers, new sounds to be controlled are being created at an accelerating pace. While the sounds of the piano and other acoustic instruments continue to be sounds of choice, they are routinely mixed with new sounds that approach the richness and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of acoustic sounds but have never been heard before.<sup>5</sup> The creation of a musical work such as a pop song used to <br>

<br>
<span class="Caption">A home music studio that uses Musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">Instrument</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Interfaces (MIDIs).</span>
<br> involve the creation of a few fixed elements: melody, rhythm, <a class="thought" href="entries/harmony_entry.html">harmony</a>, lyrics, and orchestration, say. Now an entirely new <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of new timbres, has been added. This has led to the appearance of a new type of musician, one who specializes in sound design. Rare these days is the successful pop song that does not introduce some new timbre to the music world's palette of sounds.</p>
<p>Sound modification techniques are being developed as rapidly as new sounds and control methods. It is now possible with personal computers and appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to take a musical note, break it into all of its frequency components, reshape the amplitude (or loudness) envelope of each such <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>, and then reassemble the sound.<sup>6</sup> Like most experiments, many such attempts fail to produce anything worthwhile, but the experiments that do succeed are creating an ever expanding repertoire of new, musically relevant timbres. A wide variety of sound modification techniques can be used off-line when editing a multi-instrumental composition and controlled in real-time during performance.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has overcome many of the conventional limitations of acoustic instruments. All sounds can now be played polyphonically and be layered (i.e., played simultaneously) or sequenced with one another.<sup>7</sup> Also, it is no longer necessary to play music in real time.<sup>8</sup> Traditionally, music performance has often depended on nearly superhuman feats of finger acrobatics. While technical playing skills are still being used to good effect by the virtuosos, absence of such skills no longer represents a barrier to the creation of music. <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> can be performed at one speed and played back at another, without changing the pitch or other characteristics of the notes. Further, it is possible to edit a recorded sequence by inserting, changing, and deleting notes in much the same way that one edits a text document with a <a class="thought" href="entries/word_processor_entry.html">word processor</a>. In this way, music can be created that would be impossible to perform in real-time.<sup>9</sup>
</p><h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as composer</h2><p>Expert systems and other <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> techniques are also providing new methods for composing music. A musician can provide his own original ideas for a composition and allow the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to do the rest of the work using systems that are programmed with extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the music composition process.<sup>10</sup> One such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can compose music automatically, the Cybernetic Composer, was developed by Charles Ames and Michael Domino. The Cybernetic Composer composes entire pieces automatically, while similar systems allow the musician to contribute his own musical ideas. For example, one can write the melody and rhythm and allow the expert-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to generate the harmonic progression, the walking bass line, the drum accompaniment, or any combination of these parts. Such systems will be of growing value in teaching music composition and theory, as well as in allowing composers to concentrate on those aspects of the composition process where they can add the most <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>.<sup>11</sup> Also increasing in popularity are systems that allow the musician to interactively change parameters of a piece in real time essentially, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-assisted improvisation. For example, for the Macintosh there is Jam Factory, M, <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">Mouse</a>, and Ovaltine.<sup>12</sup> Other computerized aids for composers include systems that can automatically generate high-quality music notation. Examples include Finale, Professional Composer, and an advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> now under development by Don Byrd.<sup>13</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> systems are likely to have a major impact on music <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. In place of the tedious and simpleminded auto-play type of features found on home organs, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> musical instruments for the home will contain intelligent music accompanists that can help teach music and provide both children and adults with a richer musical <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> at early stages of keyboard skill development.<sup>14</sup>
</p>
<p>Mirroring the broadening choices in sounds and musical control is a broadening appreciation in popular music for diverse musical traditions. Initiated in part by the Beatles almost two decades ago and fueled by many other musical innovators, popular music has expanded from its Afro-American roots to include today the rhythms, styles, melodies, and harmonies of folk and classical traditions from around the world.</p>
<p>Thus today's musicians are confronted by a staggering array of choices: an ever expanding set of sounds, music controllers, sound-modification techniques, sequencing methods, composition tools, and even music traditions. All of this does not necessarily make the musician's job easier: it is generally not desirable to use a plethora of sounds and processing techniques in a single work. Indeed, much of popular music has been criticized for the overuse of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> techniques.</p>
<p>The goal of music, however, remains the same: the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> of emotions and ideas from musician to listener through sound, using the elements of melody, rhythm, <a class="thought" href="entries/harmony_entry.html">harmony</a>, timbre, and <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>. The challenge for the musical artist is the same as for all artists: to make choices, to select the right timbres and melodies to express their musical ideas.</p><h1>The Visual Arts</h1><blockquote>An image can be placed somewhere between these two antipodes:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Realism = <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">Abstraction</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">Abstraction</a> = Realism</blockquote>
<blockquote>Wassily Kandinski, <i>The Problem of Form</i> (1912)</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned above, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> revolution in the visual arts lags well behind the major transformation already taking place in the musical arts. In music, computers are no longer a novelty but are now the strongest driving force in the rapidly changing face of music creation. In the visual arts there is still a widespread tendency to view the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as an interloper, as something alien to the creative process.<sup>15</sup> This inclination is reinforced by the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> art has until recently been constrained by the limited resolution of most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> display screens and hard-copy output devices.<sup>16</sup> For several years now <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based devices have been able to create, modify, and manage sounds without compromising the quality and accuracy of the result. The comparable situation in the visual arts is only now becoming possible. The result is that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> art, while a creative and rapidly changing field, is not yet in the mainstream. Recognition that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is a viable and powerful tool for artistic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> with unique capabilities should become more widespread in the early 1990s now that the latest generation of personal computers is providing an ability to create graphics comparable to other artistic media.<sup>17</sup>
</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based art techniques over manual methods apply to any <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>--e.g., ease of revising, of making backup and archival copies, of making many types of global transformations (in music, transposing; in art, changing size or color). The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> also permits the use of techniques that would otherwise be impossible to realize.</p>
<p>Methods for using the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to create visual art vary. The most straightforward approach is to simply use the display screen as a window onto a simulated canvas. The Macintosh MacPaint <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and many more-recent applications popularized the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as a sketchpad but also made obvious some of its limitations, including an inability to represent fine detail, the jagged appearance of curved lines, and for many of these systems, the lack of color. More recent high-resolution color graphics displays are now beginning to provide image quality comparable to that of good 35-mm slides.<sup>18</sup> Foremost among the advantages of using a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen as a canvas is the availability of image-processing techniques that would be impossible using ordinary paints and pencils. Among the dozens of techniques available, users can alter shadings, reconstruct surfaces, synthesize natural and artificial backgrounds, create reflections, and distort shapes.<sup>19</sup>
</p>
<p>One simple technique is the automatic repetition and rotation of images. If the original image is complex, this would require enormous skill, not to mention time, to perform manually. Using a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, artists can easily view any <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> from any orientation, complete with accurate perspectives if so desired.<sup>20</sup> But few artists would be happy with these exotic techniques if the more ordinary effects they have always used were not available. Just as each musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> provides its own unique set of methods for sound modification (vibrato, pizzicato, and others on a violin, for example), each <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of visual art creation provides techniques for creating and modifying color and shape. Oil paints provide an ability to blend and fuse colors, pastels provide certain types of shadings, and so on. With improvements in display <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/image_processing_entry.html">image processing</a> techniques, artists at a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> canvas will soon be able to simulate all of these techniques in a single medium, while taking advantage of methods that would be impossible with real paints and solvents.<sup>21</sup>

</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest advantage the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> gives to the artist is the ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> and change one's mind. Doing this is quite difficult with real paints, but it is one of the inherent benefits of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> canvas.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">Artificial life</a></h2><p>An unusual way of applying computers to visual art is called <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>.<sup>22</sup> This technique uses the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to create a simulated environment with simulated "organisms" controlled by a "genetic" code.<sup>23</sup> The artist provides the genetic code and the rules for procreation and survival. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> then simulates dozens or even thousands of generations of simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. The resulting "creatures" and environment can be quite beautiful. The artist is thus like a deist god who creates a starting point and then unleashes a recursive process of repetitive re-creation.<sup>24</sup> The artistic value of this technique should not be surprising. After all, real <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has certainly created a myriad of beautiful forms. In fact, <a class="thought" href="entries/aesthetics_entry.html">aesthetics</a> itself is often considered to be rooted in the <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a> of the natural creation. The artificial-life approach to creating art is to imitate this ultimate design force.</p><h2>Fractals</h2><p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">Artificial life</a> is considered a recursive technique because each new generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> begets the next.<sup>25</sup> The ultimate application of <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> to design involves the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> of fractals. <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">Fractal</a> images are derived from a branch of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>, devised in the 1970s by <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Fellow Benoit Mandelbrot.<sup>26</sup> One <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> for generating a <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> image is through a recursive procedure in which specific parts of a picture (e.g., every straight line) are repeatedly replaced with more complex parts. By using various starting figures and transformations, a great variety of patterns can be generated.</p>
<p>There are actually several types of fractals. I have been discussing geometric fractals. Instead of using exactly the same transformation at each stage, we can allow a random process to control the transformations (randomly skipping some of the steps, for example). In these chaotic fractals, the patterns are less regular and, oddly enough, more natural.<sup>27</sup> This observation led Mandelbrot to realize the potential application of fractals to describing a wide variety of natural phenomena, including economic trends, the progression of epidemics, the organization of proteins, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of music.<sup>28</sup>

<p>Fractals have a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of interesting properties. Unlike most mathematically generated shapes, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> is the same at all scales of magnification. Magnify a <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> a thousand times, and it still looks the same. Magnify it another thousand times, and again, no essential change. This paradoxical quality describes a surprisingly large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of natural phenomena quite well. The most famous example is that of coastlines. Maps of coastlines have the same jagged appearance regardless of their scale.<sup>29</sup> Another important example is cloud formation. Pictures of clouds look the same whether one looks at a cloud of 10 feet or a cloud of 100 miles.<sup>30</sup>
</p>
<p>Indeed, perfect fractals keep the same appearance at all scales. But <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> like shapes in the real world have this property, called self-similarity, only to a point.<sup>31</sup> In a graphic display the limit is the granularity of the display, which is known as the pixel size.<sup>32</sup> In the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> as a whole, which turns out to be a spongelike <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a>, the pixel corresponds to the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>. Within galaxies, a different type of <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> known as a <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> whorl governs the organization of stars.<sup>33</sup>
</p>
<p>The word "<a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a>" derives from the phrase "<i>fractional</i> dimension."<sup>34</sup> Because of its infinitely fine detail, a perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> shape actually has infinite length even though it resides on a finite two-dimensional surface. According to <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>, it therefore has a dimensionality somewhere in between that of an ordinary line segment, which has a dimensionality of 1, and a surface, which has a dimensionality of 2.<sup>35</sup> For example, the Koch snowflake has a dimensionality of 1.26, just slightly greater than the coastline of Great Britain, which is considered to have 1.25 dimensions. The galactic sponge has been estimated to have about 2.2 dimensions.<sup>36</sup>
</p>
<p>For the sciences and engineering disciplines, <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> provides a powerful tool for understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> of turbulence, chaos, and other unpredictable patterns.<sup>37</sup> For the visual arts, <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> provides an equally powerful methodology for creating images that can be natural, spectacular, or both. Fractals are capable of generating realistic clouds, trees, bushes, lakes, mountains, shorelines, landscapes, and other similar images.<sup>38</sup> For example, George Lucas used the technique to create the moons of Endor in his film <i>The Return of the Jedi</i>. It can create environments that, while very alien-looking, appear to be the result of natural processes.<sup>39</sup>
</p><h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as artist</h2><p>Another use of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to create artistic images is to provide a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a set of rules and other <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures that explain the processes of drawing, composition, and layout and to let it be the artist. Probably the leading exponent of this approach is <a class="thought" href="entries/cohen_entry.html">Harold Cohen</a>. Cohen has programmed over 1,000 rules for the creation of complex drawings; his <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> uses these to direct a robotic drawing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to create the drawings.<sup>40</sup> These can be of people, plants, or abstract objects. Cohen clearly intends the pictures as art, and indeed, his work has been highly acclaimed. Cohen, who is considered a master colorist, often colors in his robot's drawings manually. His latest ambition is to build a robot colorist programmed with his own theory of coloring.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as artist raises a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of interesting questions. First, who is the artist? Cohen claims that he is, and his <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has not been programmed to complain. Second, why bother? Why not simply make the drawings directly? Both of these questions also pertain to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as composer.</p>
<p>These are important questions, and there are, in my view, several answers. First, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> art is a perfectly legitimate means of creating art. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is simply a tool, a medium through which the artist (or musician) is expressing himself.</p>
<p>Second, the work of art is, in a sense, more interesting. We can regard the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> itself as the work of art that manifests itself differently every time we choose to look at it (or listen to it). It is a work of art that can change its appearance as quickly as the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> can generate a new drawing. Since the style is unmistakably similar in each such manifestation, all manifestations can reasonably be regarded as a single work. It can be pointed out, however, that it is not unusual for multiple works of one artist to exhibit such a degree of similarity. We can, therefore, consider a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> such as Cohen's to be either an artist itself, or a work of art, or both.</p>
<p>Third, the rules themselves give us an objective and rigorous statement of the theory of the artwork and thus an unprecedented degree of insight into its <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>. Understanding the boundary between the rules themselves and the expressive aspects of art that we might feel cannot (yet) be expressed with such precision also provides a valuable perspective.</p>
<p>The rules also have educational value. In art, a great deal is known about perspective, composition, the drawing of different types of shapes, and other facets of visual art. These facets can be expressed in precise terms. Similarly, a great deal can be said with mathematical precision regarding the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of rhythm, harmonic progressions, the structures of different genres of melodies, and the other elements of music. Creating rules that can in turn create entire satisfactory works of art (or music) helps us to understand, and therefore to teach, the objective aspects of artistic creation.</p>
<p>Finally, such systems can have practical value. In music they can perform compositional chores by automatically creating walking bass lines, rhythmic accompaniments, and so on. In the visual arts, after the artist indicated his intentions, such cybernetic assistants could finish a drawing, performing chores of shading, coloring, creating perspective, balancing the sizes of objects for proper compositional balance, and other tasks. In this mode of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>, such <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based assistants would always be working under the careful eye (or ear) of the artist.</p>
<p>Such automatic assistants have already been actively harnessed in the creation of animation, where the chores of creating hundreds of thousands of images (over a thousand per minute of film) is formidable. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>-based animation systems have substantially boosted the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> of human animators.<sup>41</sup> Another area of <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> art where <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> design stations are already of substantial practical value is in fashion design and layout.</p>
<p>As in the world of music, the role of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not to displace human <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> but rather to amplify it. It is a tool, like a paintbrush, but one of unique and virtually unlimited potential. Clearly, the great artists of old must have had many ideas beyond the ones they had the time to actually express. By reducing the many chores involved, computers can give artists the opportunity to realize more of their artistic visions.</p>
<p>Also, many <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> techniques allow the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of forms that are simply impossible to realize in any other way. Because the results of some of these methods, such as recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> generation, are unpredictable until they are tried, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be a partner with the artist in exploring the artist's <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can open the world of artistic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> to more participants. Many of us have rich visual imaginations and a good sense of aesthetic judgement but are lacking in the technical skills to express our imaginations using conventional artistic materials and techniques. The inability to draw a straight line (as the ads used to say) may no longer be a barrier to becoming an effective and successful artist.<sup>42</sup>

<span class="Caption">Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corp. and developer of Lotus 1-2-3 and Agenda.</span>
<br> Interleaf, <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a>, and others, provides writers with their own personal publishing capability through the use of an ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> and a laser <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>.<sup>46</sup>
</p>
<p>A new genre of expert systems for personal computers are now appearing that provide assistance in the organization of ideas. These systems allow users to explore a set of thoughts, notice patterns and similarities, and develop outlines that can later be fleshed out into text. Some of these systems are intended to be used in real time as thoughts develop and include abilities to organize a variety of activities. A prime example of this type of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is Lotus's Agenda, developed by Mitch Kapor.<sup>47</sup>
</p>
<p>Expert systems can also be applied to tracking the complex histories, characterizations, and interactions of characters in such extended works of fiction as long novels, series of novels, and television drama series. (A <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can assist with the development of characters and plots for soap operas is described in Michael Lebowitz, "All Work and No Play Makes <a class="thought" href="entries/hal_entry.html">HAL</a> a Dull <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>" in this chapter.)</p>
<p>Most challenging of all would be a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that could actually write or substantively assist with the writing of prose or verse in the same way that expert systems are now beginning to assist the composer and the graphic artist. Efforts have been made to accomplish this, and some are represented in the epigraphs at the beginning of this section and in the article "A (Kind of) <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>" in this chapter. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> undoubtedly has a role to play in the generation of text, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> generated prose and verse is a small but flourishing field. The results, however, are significantly less successful to date than in the musical and visual arts. <a class="thought" href="entries/racter_entry.html">RACTER</a>'s prose has its charm, but is somewhat demented-sounding, due primarily to its rather limited understanding of what it is talking about.<sup>48</sup> Deeply imbedded in written <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, extensive, diverse, and intricately organized <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, the vast bulk of which has yet to be captured. With <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> translation systems currently providing only 80 to 90 percent accuracy on technical texts, it is not yet realistic (until well into the first half of the next century) to expect computers to have sufficient facility with <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to generate literary quality text without assistance.<sup>49</sup> The objection might be raised that there is a comparable depth of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in works of music and of visual arts. This is certainly true. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why computers have had greater success in assisting with the creative process in these areas is that we have a better understanding of the surface structures of music and visual art (particularly the former) than we do for literature. But even in these fields, the ultimate responsibility for making an artistic statement is still the province of the human artist.</p>
<p>The role of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is the same for all of the arts. First is to provide an effective tool for improving the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> of the artist, to enable him to realize more of his <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. Second, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can provide forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> that were previously unavailable. Finally, to whatever extent we are able to capture even a portion of the creative process in a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, we learn something about the art form as well as the process of creating it. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be a powerful partner in exploring our thoughts and emotions and finding new ways of expressing them.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The application of computing technology to any given field tends to follow a two-step pattern. First, computing is used to streamline existing patterns of behavior within that field. Second, computing power is applied to re-engineer the entire field -- a re-engineering which usually involves abstracting the field's concepts and processes to a higher level. Step Two tends to produce much greater benefits than Step One.
<br>
<br>
This is to be expected. Technologies don't exist in a vacuum; they are surrounded by cultural practices, and these cultural practices are much harder to change than are technologies. Roman numerals seem terribly cumbersome to us today, but only because they are not well-suited to our technologies of mental arithmetic and pocket calculators. Roman numerals were eminently well-suited to the Roman hand abacus.
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614001923/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_abacus" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_abacus</a>
<br>
<br>
Likewise, traditional music notation is well-suited to acoustic instruments. An acoustic instrument's user interface is inextricably tied to the control of discrete pitches, which can be intoned only to a modest degree (with unfretted strings and the trombone being obvious exceptions). Pressing a certain combination of buttons, while holding one's embouchure in a given way, produces a given pitch -- C, Bb, A#, or whatever. Same with the piano or fretted strings. So traditional staff notation is acoustic instruments what Roman numerals were to the Roman hand abacus.
<br>
<br>
However, there's a problem with traditional music notation and musical instrument interfaces: they are infamously hard to learn. This difficulty has been discounted for centuries as just being a matter of talent -- some have it, some don't. But that's really not the problem at all.
<br>
<br>
The problem is that traditional musical instruments and notation are focused on the wrong level of abstraction: pitch. Pitch is the log representation of frequency (expressed in cycles per second, also known as Hertz, or Hz). But music theory has nothing to do with pitch. Music theory is all about intervals ' i.e., the ratios between frequencies (expressed in cents, with 1200 cents to the octave). Most of the problems in music education, I submit, stem from this mis-match between the level of abstraction of musical instruments &amp; notation (pitch) and the level of abstraction of music theory (interval), which forces students to learn to "do" without understanding what they are doing. This makes music like alchemy ' mindless memorization of sequences of gestures without any unifying theory.
<br>
<br>
Just deciding to teach music theory sooner, or in more depth, doesn't help. The mis-match in levels of abstraction ' divorcing theory from practice ' makes music theory the third most-often failed course at the university level (after organic chemistry and differential equations).  Introducing theory to younger students, while retaining the mis-match, would just cause music students to quit earlier, which is why most music lessons are essentially theory-free.
<br>
<br>
The solution is to raise the level of abstraction in musical interfaces and notation to match the level of music theory. This is a classic example of the 'second step' in the application of computing power to any given problem (re-engineering the process).
<br>
<br>
One example of such an interval-based notation is the ThumMusic System, described here:
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614001923/http://www.thummer.com/blog/2007/09/thummusic-system.html" target="_blank">http://www.thummer.com/blog/2007/09/thummusic-syst  em.html</a>
<br>
<br>
The combination of data compression, conceptual concreteness, and sensory concurrency offered by the ThumMusic System holds the potential to accelerate musical learning by more than an order of magnitude.
<br>
<br>
The ThumMusic System is based on a combination of electronic music synthesis (via MIDI), electronic transposition, a chromatic staff, tonic solfa (specifically 'moveable Do with a La-based minor'), and an isomorphic keyboard.
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614001923/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard</a>
<br>
<br>
One example of a music control interface that's compatible with the ThumMusic System is the Thummer:
<br>
www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYdFM97ybgA
<br>
<br>
The Thummer has been described as being potentially the most expressive polyphonic instrument ever.
<br>
www.thummer.com/reviews.asp
<br>
<br>
The combination of the ThumMusic System and the Thummer has revealed new insights into the structure of music, exposing new musical discoveries (such as tuning invariance) and new musical effects (such as Dynamic Tonality) which could be the basis of new musical styles. Further, it hints at the potential for a Grand Unified Music Theory that embraces the inharmonic music of non-Western cultures such as that based on the indigenous Thai renat, Indonesian gamelan, and African balafon, while also embracing the various temperings of harmonic sounds (12-tone equal temperament, baroque meantone tuning, Arabic extended Pythagorean tuning, etc), all using the same consistent notation, theory, and instrument fingering.

It is not surprising that this &amp; simpler level of abstraction requires a novel instrument, just as the use of Arabic numerals required the use of new arithmetic algorithms (and was later facilitated by the use of digital calculators).
<br>
<br>
I submit that this is an example of the second stage of the Science of Art, in which the fundamental assumptions of an art ' in this case, the primacy of musical pitch ' is challenged by re-engineering the tools of the art to embrace a higher level of abstraction. I further submit that it is at this stage where the pay-off to computerization is greatest.

This pay-off might be of interest to a firm such as Hyundai/Kurzweil, which might be seeking to disrupt the music products status quo with just such an innovative approach to music-making'</p></td>
