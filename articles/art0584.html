<div class="TeaserText">The point in time when current trends may go wildly off the charts--known as the "Singularity"--is now getting serious attention. What it suggests is that technological change will soon become so rapid that we cannot possibly envision its results.</div>

<p>Technological change isn't just happening fast. It's happening 
              at an exponential rate. Contrary to the commonsense, intuitive, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> view, we won't just <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 100 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the 
              twenty-first century&#8212;it will be more like 20,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.</p>
<p>The near-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> results of exponential technological <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> will 
              be staggering: the merging of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities 
              in bio&#173;robotics, plants and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered to grow <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> 
              drugs, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-based "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>," smart robots, and <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              that self-replicate like living <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s are even 
              warning that we could lose control of this expanding techno-cornucopia 
              and cause the total <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as we know it. Others are 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ing how this permanent technological overdrive will affect 
              us. They're trying to understand what this new world of ours will 
              look like and how accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> already impacts us.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of scientists believe <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will surpass 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> within a few decades, leading to what's come 
              to be called the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. Author and <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> defines 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> as "technological change so rapid and profound it 
              could create a rupture in the very fabric of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> is technically a mathematical term, perhaps best described 
              as akin to what happens on world maps in a standard atlas. Everything 
              appears correct until we look at regions very close to the poles. 
              In the standard Mercator projection, the poles appear not as points 
              but as a straight line. Each line is a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>: Everywhere along 
              the top line contains the exact point of the North Pole, and the 
              bottom line is the entire South Pole.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> on the edge of the map is nothing compared to the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> at the center of a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>. Here one finds the astrophysicist's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>, a rift in the continuum of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> where Einstein's 
              rules no longer function. The approaching technological <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>, 
              like the singularities of <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s, marks a point of departure 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. Explorers once wrote "Beyond here be dragons" on the 
              edges of old maps of the known world, and the image of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as we 
              approach these edges of change are proving to be just as mysterious, 
              dangerous, and controversial.</p>
<p>There is no concise definition for the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. Kurzweil and 
              many <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a>ists define it as "a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when societal, scientific, 
              and economic change is so fast we cannot even imagine what will 
              happen from our present perspective." A range of dates is given 
              for the advent of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. "I'd be surprised if it happened 
              before 2004 or after 2030," writes author and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> professor 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a>. A distinctive feature will be that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              will have exceeded and even merged with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Another 
              definition is used by <a class="thought" href="entries/extropian_entry.html">extropian</a>s, who say it denotes "the singular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when technological development will be at its fastest." From 
              an environmental perspective, the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> can be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of 
              as the point at which <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> become one. Whatever 
              perspective one takes, at this juncture the world as we have known 
              it will become extinct, and new definitions of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> will take hold.</p>
<p>Many leading <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> industries have been aware of the possibility 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> for some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. There are concerns that, if the 
              public understood its ramifications, they might panic over accepting 
              new and untested technologies that bring us closer to <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. 
              For now, the debate about the consequences of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> has 
              stayed within the halls of business and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; the kinks are 
              being worked out, avoiding "doomsday" hysteria. At this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it 
              appears to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> little if the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> ever truly comes to 
              pass.</p>
<h2>What Will <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> Look Like?</h2>
<p>Kurzweil explains that central to the workings of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> 
              are a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of "laws," one of which is <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>. Intel cofounder 
              Gordon E. Moore noted that the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s that could 
              fit on a single <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> had doubled every year for six years 
              from the beginnings of <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s in 1959. Moore predicted 
              that the trend would continue, and it has&amp;#8212although the doubling 
              rate was later adjusted to an 18-month cycle. </p>
<p>Today, the smallest <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s in chips span only thousands of 
              atoms (hundreds of nanometers). Chipmakers build such <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              using a process in which they apply semiconducting, metallic, and 
              insulating layers to a <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> wafer to create microscopic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry. They accomplish the procedure using <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> for imprinting 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s onto the wafer. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to keep <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a> moving right 
              along, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers today have built <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s out of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, 
              wires, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s as tiny as a few atoms across that can 
              carry out simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s.</p>
<p>Kurzweil and <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>' chief scientist <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> agree that, 
              circa 2030, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the 1999 film The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a> (which visualized 
              a three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> between humans and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, calling 
              conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> into question) will be within our grasp and 
              that humanity will be teetering on the edge of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. 
              (See their essays in Taking the Red Pill: <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a>, and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">Religion</a> in The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, edited by Glenn Yeffeth, 2003.) Kurzweil 
              explains that this will become possible because <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a> will 
              be replaced by another computing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> over the next few decades. 
              "<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a> was not the first but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing power," Kurzweil says. The first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry 
              used in the 1890 American census. This electromechanical computing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was followed by the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s of relay-based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, and eventually <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s. "Every 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> ran out of steam," states Kurzweil, "another <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              came along and picked up where that <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> left off." The sixth 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, the one that will enable <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> &#225; la The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, will 
              be here in 20 to 30 years. "It's obvious what the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              will be&amp;#8212computing in three dimensions," says Kurzweil. "We 
              will effectively <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/brand_entry.html">Stewart Brand</a> in his book The Clock of the Long Now discusses the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> and another related law, Monsanto's law, which states 
              that the ability to identify and use genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> doubles 
              every 12 to 24 months. This <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>

<p>A field of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> building on the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> rate of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>&#8212;the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of building <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              out of atoms. A nanometer is atomic in scale, a distance that's 
              0.001% of the width of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> hair. One goal of this <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is to 
              change the atomic fabric of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>&#8212;to <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#173;like 
              atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s that reproduce like living <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. In this respect, 
              it is similar to <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, except that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> needs 
              to literally create something like an inorganic version of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to 
              drive the building of its tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. "We're working out the 
              rules of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> in a realm where <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> hasn't had the opportunity 
              to work," states University of Texas biochemistry professor Angela 
              Belcher. "What would take millions of years to evolve on its own 
              takes about three weeks on the bench top."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is knocking down the barriers between all the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s. Chemists, biologists, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, and physicists are now 
              finding themselves collaborating on more and more <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>.

              could usher in the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of people closest to these theories and laws&#8212;the

<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a>-Enabled Mass Destruction</h2>
<p>In April 2000, a wrench was thrown into the arrival of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> 
              by an unlikely source: Sun Micro&#173;systems chief scientist <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>. 
              He is a neo-Luddite without being a Luddite, a technologist warning 
              the world about <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Joy co-founded <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>, helped

<p>In a now-infamous cover story in <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a> magazine, "Why the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> 
              Doesn't Need Us," Joy warned of the dangers posed by developments 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>. Joy's warning of the

              credence to the coming <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. Unless things change, Joy predicted, 
              "We could be the last generation of humans." Joy warned that "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              alone will enable mass destruction" and termed this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>&#173;enabled 
              mass destruction."</p>
<p>The twentieth century gave rise to nuclear, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, and chemical 
              (NBC) technologies that, while powerful, require <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to vast 
              amounts of raw (and often rare) materials, technical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              and large-scale industries. The twenty-first-century technologies 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>), however, will require 
              neither large facilities nor rare raw materials.</p>
<p>The threat posed by <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies becomes further amplified 
              by the fact that some of these new technologies have been designed 
              to be able to replicate&#8212;i.e., they can build new versions of 
              themselves. Nuclear bombs did not sprout more bombs, and toxic spills 
              did not grow more spills. If the new self&#173;replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies 
              are released into the environment, they could be nearly impossible 
              to recall or control.</p>
<p>Joy understands that the greatest dangers we face ultimately stem 
              from a world where global corporations dominate&amp;#8212a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> where 
              much of the world has no voice in how the world is run. Twenty-first-century 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies, he writes, "are being developed almost exclusively 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> enterprises. We are aggressively pursuing the promises 
              of these new technologies within the now-unchallenged <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of 
              global <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> and its manifold financial incentives and competitive 
              pressures."</p>
<p>Joy believes that the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of global <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a>, combined with 
              our current rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, gives the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race a 30% to 50% 
              chance of going extinct around the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> is expected 
              to happen, around 2030. "Not only are these estimates not encouraging," 
              he adds, "but they do not include the probability of many horrid 
              outcomes that lie short of <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>."</p>
<p>It is very likely that scientists and global corporations will 
              miss key developments&#8212;or, worse, actively avoid discussion 
              of them. A whole generation of biologists has left the field for 
              the biotech and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> labs. Biologist Craig Holdredge, who has 
              followed biotech since its beginnings in the 1970s, warns, "<a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a> 
              is losing its connection with <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>."</p>

              I mean our man-made world of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, is becoming alive in ways

              it bleed from its wound. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> shoots back, it may be surprised 
              to find the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> gush smoke. "It would be rather a great moment 
              of truth for both of them," Dick added.</p>
<p>In November 2001, Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> of Massachusetts jarred 
              the nation's focus away from recession and <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a> when it announced 
              that it had succeeded in cloning early-stage <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s. Debate 
              on the topic stayed equally divided between those who support therapeutic 
              cloning and those, like the American Medical Association, who want 
              an outright ban.</p>
<p>Karel Capek coined the word <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> (Czech for "forced labor") in 
              the 1920 play R.U.R., in which <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s assume the drudgery of factory 
              production, then develop feelings and proceed to wipe out humanity 
              in a violent revolution. While the robots in R.U.R. could represent 
              the "nightmare vision of the proletariat seen through middle-class 
              eyes," as &#173;science-fiction author Thomas Disch has suggested, they 
              also are testament to the persistent fears of man-made <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              run amok.</p>
<p>Similar themes have manifested themselves in popular culture and 
              folklore since at least medieval times. While some might dismiss 
              these stories simply as popular paranoia, robots are already being 
              deployed beyond Hollywood and are poised to take over the deadlier 
              duties of the modern soldier. The Pentagon is replacing soldiers 
              with sensors, vehicles, aircraft, and <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s that can be operated 
              by remote control or are autonomous. Pilot&#173;less aircraft played 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant role in the bombings of Afghanistan, and a model called 
              the Gnat conducted surveillance flights in the Philippines in 2002.</p>
<p>Leading the Pentagon's remote-control <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a> effort is the Defense 
              Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects Agency (<a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a>). Best known for creating

              with Boeing to develop the X-45 unmanned combat air vehicle. The 
              30-foot-long windowless planes will carry up to 12 bombs, each weighing 
              250 pounds. According to <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> analysts, the X-45 will be used 
              to attack radar and antiaircraft installations as early as 2007. 
              By 2010, it will be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to distinguish friends from foes 
              without consulting humans and independently attack targets in designated 
              areas. By 2020, robotic planes and vehicles will direct remote-controlled 
              bombers toward targets, robotic helicopters will coordinate driverless 
              convoys, and unmanned submarines will clear mines and launch cruise

<h2>Keys to Understanding the Singularity</h2>
<p>Singularity is the postulated point in our future when human evolutionary 
              development&#8212;powered by such developments as nanotechnology, 
              neuroscience, and artificial intelligence&amp;#8212accelerates enormously 
              so that nothing beyond that time can reliably be conceived. Typical 
              developments include the merging of man and machine (cybernetic 
              organisms&#8212;or cyborgs) and accelerated technology beyond our 
              ability to control.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology is the development and use of devices that have 
              a size of only a few nanometers, including building and manipulating 
              complex structures on an atomic scale. As we approach the Singularity, 
              nano&#173;devices will be able to replicate themselves like living matter.</p>
<p>Biorobotics is the merging of living organisms with technologies. 
              At a simple level, this includes implanting chips encoded with health 
              or security information. Biorobotics also encompasses the development 
              of cyborgs that seamlessly blend living tissue with mechanical devices. 
            </p>
<p>Cloning is the growing of genetically identical cells, eliminating 
              the natural role of human biology and bringing us closer to the 
              Singularity.</p>
<p>Extropians await the Singularity, seeking to overcome human limits, 
              live indefinitely long, and become more intelligent through technology. 
              Related groups include transhumanists and posthumanists.</p>
<p>Neo-Luddites oppose the impending Singularity by raising questions 
              about moral and ethical aspects of modern technology and the threat 
              it may pose to humanity.</p>
<h2>The Singularity</h2>
<h2><a href="javascript:openImage('images/JJBell-singularity_chart2.gif',400,519)"><img border="0" height="260" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091008125541im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/JJBell-singularity_chart_sm.gif" width="200"></a><br>
<i><font size="1">The Futurist</font></i> </h2>
<p><i>Technological progress grows exponentially and reaches infinity 
              in finite time</i> <i>(click image for larger view)</i></p>
<p>Technological progress goes through four stages: new capability, 
              integration, technological limit, and decline as a new paradigm 
              takes over. Each new capability represents a technological revolution 
              that gradually gives rise to a new techno-economic paradigm, which 
              guides entrepreneurs, innovators, investors, and consumers. Singularity 
              pioneer Vernor Vinge argues that successive innovations will occur 
              in progressively shorter time frames as each new technology increases 
              in power and converges with others, as when advances in the life 
              sciences are accelerated by increasing computer power. Ever-shortening 
              time periods make the aggregate power curve "hyper-exponential," 
              with the resulting waves of technological convergences eventually 
              reaching the Singularity.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Apparently Singularitarians, Transhumanists, pro-globalization economists and other advocates of exponential energy use haven't been talking to the petroleum geologists. The signs of a global fossil fuels crisis are getting increasingly hard to deny. North America is facing a potentially disastrous shortage of natural gas THIS YEAR. It's so bad that U.S Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has called an emergency meeting with leaders in the energy industry this month to try to come up with ways to deal with it before winter causes a potential crisis. And Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so worried about the economic effect of diminishing natgas stocks that he's scheduled to testify about it before a congressional committee on Tuesday, June 10.
<br>
<br>
Despite fantasies about transitioning to a "hydrogen economy" in response to gentle price signals from declining fossil fuels supplies, this emergency has caught North America completely flat-footed, and there is no plan -- NONE! -- for any kind of transition to fuels based on renewable energy. Add in the Bush Administration's seizure of Iraq earlier this year, and it becomes increasingly clear that the people running things know what is happening, but they apparently either don't know how to solve it or are unwilling to change the current system as long as there's short-term profit to be made.
<br>
<br>
Look to developments in New Zealand to see what could happen in the rest of the developed world as we enter the Post-Carbon Age. While New Zealand uses a lot of hydroelectric power, it needs additional generational capacity from fossil fuels. But its main gas field is becoming exhausted, and the power companies are having to convert to coal -- a much less desirable fuel -- much of which they have to import from Australia and Indonesia because the local supply won't suffice for more than a few years. New Zealand's few resources and geographic isolation make it the "miner's canary" of our future in the U.S.,  showing how hard it will be to keep the electricity online at a level sufficient for a developed industrial society when fossil fuels run out.</p></td>

<br>
    If one of the foundational principles of singularity is the unpredictability of developments at or beyond the point of singularity, how could anyone, environtmentalist or not, "know what hit them"?
<br>
    The quote to which I am responding suggests that those who dislike the idea of singularity will either delude themsleves into believeing it will not happen or otherwise bury their heads in the sands of ignorance to avoid confronting the subject.  I look to the idea of singularity with a strong sense of apprehension and fear- of the unknown.  Yet it is this fear that compelled to me to join this discussion and further compels me to learn as much as possible about the idea of singularity.  All those interested in this theory must remember that no amount of prior knowledge will be sufficient to prepare human inidividuals for singularity, if it comes to pass.

<br>
I concede that it is unfair. However, I do not think it is uncalled for. An observation that I have made about environmentalists is that they tend to be more like zealots&#151;to use your own term&#151;than like visionaries. They get locked onto one issue and push it beyond the point where it is any longer applicable. While environmentalists were worrying about overpopulation, the people who had access to the resources that could lead to overpopulation were already loosing interest in having babies. Now, environmentalists are worried about global warming, when the effect of global warming will probably never get a chance to manifest. Many of them are trying to reinterpret the issue of the singularity in terms of issues that they area already familiar with, rather than recognizing it as a completely new problem with completely new parameters. Moreover, they seem completely blind to the massive and overwhelming implications of the singularity and the stark reality that it will dominate all previous issues. 
<br>
<br>
However, lest I be mistaken, I must assert that it was the efforts of environmentalists that resulted in the regulations on factory and automobile emissions that have made our air breathable; and I can&#146;t express enough gratitude for their work in eliminating the indoor pollution we call cigarette smoke. Recently, when I was in a room where people were permitted to smoke, I was struck with the unimaginable reality we once lived with. 
<br>
<br>
I once asked a pastor why the Lutheran church continued to reject the theory of evolution when the Catholics had accepted it. He said that he suspected it was a reaction to Darwinists who have argued so strongly that the theory of evolution effectively discounted the belief in anything spiritual. In my mind, both Darwinists and Christians have become too zealous in their views and both should stand back and reevaluate their motives. Like the Lutherans, I am reacting to the perceived zealousness of an organized movement. I am concerned that environmentalists will succeed in reinterpreting the singularity as a manifestation of existing environmental issues or as the mad imaginings of those who are ignorant of environmental issues. I am concerned that they will blind those who are marginally involved with the singularity to the real problem at hand, thus clouding our assessment and delaying our response. Moreover, I am concerned that they may divert all attention to environmental issues that may never manifest and take attention away from an issue that WILL manifest and could be our unwitting demise. Furthermore, I am concerned that they may, while well-intentioned, actually make the problem worse by failing to understand its true dynamics. 
<br>
<br>
As I observed in another entry, environmentalists may attempt to convince people that a cure for old age and natural death will lead to overcrowding and that any such technologies should be made illegal. I have seen this view presented in movies and TV shows as if it were an accepted fact. After studying this problem, I am convinced that an end to natural death will actually result in a decrease in reproduction that will overshadow the lowered death rate. However, a simplistic evaluation of the issue could easily lead to the conclusion that the population will increase, and it would be easy to convince the ignorant that the population will increase&#151;the mathematics seems so simple! 
<br>
<br>
Now that you see where I am coming from, I must concede that it is wrong to make a blanket statement about an ideological group based on the statements of one zealous member. But my blanket statement and your response gave me an opportunity to clarify my views. For that, I am not at all apologetic.

<br>
Past experience seems to suggest that we cannot anticipate the future. However, we may not be giving ourselves enough credit. I can&#146;t think of a single technology that some futurist, science fiction writer, or scientist didn&#146;t anticipate in some form years before it was implemented. No single author has ever put it all together in exactly the right way, but nearly all of the parts were there. 
<br>
<br>
My feeling about anticipating, understanding, and controlling the singularity is like my feeling about any natural wonder: it is only mysterious before we study it and understand it. While it would be incongruous to attempt to predict something which, by definition, is unpredictable, my hope is that by studying the singularity we may ultimately uncover some of its mystery. If this effort proves successful, then it may no longer be appropriate to call it a Technological Singularity (though I suspect that certain qualities will always warrant that characterization). 
<br>
<br>
The singularity may, by definition, be unpredictable, but there are many models for dealing with unpredictability. A football team does not know what play the other team will call, but they can practice for a variety of different plays and contingencies so that they will be ready to deal with them when they come up. Similarly, we may not be able to predict the singularity, but we may be able to construct a game plan. It is even conceivable that, although we may never guess which specific direction it will take, we may anticipate every possibility. We may accumulate and delineate a playbook of sorts, keep it on hand, and keep perfecting it up to the day of the critical event. 
<br>
<br>
Very often, things that cannot be understood in terms of specifics can be understood in terms of general principles. Gene pools are a good example of this. We do not know what every gene does, but we know approximately how many genes a particular species has, and we can use this information to make statistical predictions about how fast a population could conceivably change in a designated period of time. This approach has been very helpful to population biologists. G&#246;del&#146;s incompleteness theorem is another good example of this kind of approach. G&#246;del could not have investigated every possible mathematical structure, but he was able, through logical processes, to make a deduction that must be true over a broad range of mathematical structures. Another example from mathematics is the proof that an angle cannot be trisected. It is impossible to anticipate every possible way of attempting to trisect an angle, but it has been proven that an angle cannot be trisected using the methods of Euclidean Geometry. 
<br>
<br>
I honestly cannot say how we might ultimately master the singularity, but I suspect that if we study it and keep our eyes on it, we may be ready for it when it arrives. There may never be a moment of surprise&#151;though we may find ourselves moving pretty fast and working to our wits end as we near that asymptote. By then, many of the technologies that will make the singularity possible will already be at our disposal. We may be running massive computer simulations up to the last seconds of the human era. We may be having computers planning and running massive computer simulations and reporting back to us in only extremely conceptual terms. Who knows, we may even be employing psychics! The point is that we can do a good job of preparing for and playing this game even if there is no indication AS YET that we have any chance of winning it.

But there are decades yet to go on existing reserves, and from what I hear there is plenty more in Afganistan and in the Ocean.

However the point things are market driven...if shortages become acute and serious, the market will demand a competitive solution...such as Hydrogen.  It's amazing what can be done when there is actually a need, not a premature concern.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I would like to point out that 98% of all species which were present on earth are now extinct. Extinction often occurs when a more efficient organism arrives on the scene than it's predecessor. If, as we approach the singularity, humans begin merging with machines very rapidly, it stands to reason the old humans will be unable to compete with the new and "enhanced" variety. This evolutionary process may proceed as it has in the past-like the transition from the Wright Brothers' first airplane to the present Unmanned Aerial Vehicles capable of autonomous operations. This is the evolutionary process. When modern humans arrived on the scene some 30,000 years ago, Cro Magnon man, who had roamed the planet for 200,000+ years, mysteriously disappeared. Cro Magnon could not compete with modern man. Those humans who fail to merge with technology will also perish and a new species of humanity will rapidly take over. This isn't bad. It's nature's way.
<br>
<br>
Yes, there will be challenges, problems and opportunities. Present day humans have demonstrated short-sightedness in the areas of the environment, greed, war, and compassion for all life. It is my hope and desire that enhanced humans 20-30 years from now will be superior not only physically and intellectually to modern humans, but spiritually and co-operatively as well.
<br>
<br>
As I see it, merging of humans with machines is our only hope we have of cleaning up the global mess we find ourselves in.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Looking at this article and reading some of the entries, the thing I am wondering is how people will react in about 15 years when technology begins to get really wild. In the very first entry after the article, I see some clues. 
<br>
<br>
It is clear that this person is accustomed to thinking in terms of economy and energy. I get the impression from their opening comment about &#147;exponential energy use&#148; that they believe the singularity is economy and energy based. Computers don&#146;t use much energy, and most of the advances in miniaturization that will lead to the singularity have actually reduced the energy required to perform equivalent tasks.  It is clear that people are frightened by technology, but it is surprising how quickly they embrace it. I am absolutely dumbfounded at the pace with which people have embraced cell-phones. For a while, it looked like the prospect of brain cancer would be a big issue. But that has given way to concerns over the dangers of people talking and driving. None of this has slowed the trend. 
<br>
<br>
If the post office attempted to implement robot delivery men, some unions might protest and there could be quite a bit of sabotage. But that won&#146;t be the first place we see robots. They will be used to fight wars, storm dangerous criminals, explore sewers, and care for quarantined patients. As the technology gets cheaper, people will be using them in their homes to vacuum and mow the lawn. As their capabilities become more sophisticated, they will be used to do more elaborate tasks. Honda&#146;s Asimo is already doing service in Japan. Eventually, robots will be used as backup systems in airplanes and cars&#151;like air bags. They will start out performing peripheral tasks, but the periphery will eventually become the whole. By then, people will be so used to seeing robots that the postal robot will seem perfectly natural. 
<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology in medicine is already creeping up on us. I have explained these ideas to people that do not think a lot about technology, and they are usually aghast. However, they are OK with pill-sized robots that swim through someone&#146;s intestines taking pictures&#151;acclimatization is a powerful force. With a good sales job, they will accept nanobots swimming through their bloodstream.  
<br>
<br>
Technology won&#146;t surprise us, but it will overwhelm us. People used to thinking in terms of ecology and economy will feel like they have been left out of the loop. They will be like anti-abortion protestors when the morning-after pill was invented. They will be like Marxists when the Soviet Union Collapsed. They will be dumbfounded and bewildered. But they are only a model of this reaction. Even the programmers advancing this stuff will wonder what to do when languages become so high level that essentially everyone with a logical mind is a programmer. An acquaintance of mine, who considers himself to be quite computer literate, still answers his email in DOS. The closer you are to the technological front, the more sharply your obsolescence is felt. 
<br>
<br>
As scores of people are put out of work by machines, the government will be forced by popular consent to make welfare, social security, and unemployment more widely available. Eventually, only a handful of people will actually work and the rest will be living off of government doles or income from investments&#151;the democratization of the market has been a notable trend.

That is when the real fear will start to set in. People will realize collectively that they are guests in the world they helped to create. I honestly doubt that anyone will starve&#151;except perhaps in countries like old Iraq where the leaders control everything and don&#146;t care about the people&#151;but they will feel useless. That moment in time is the thing singularitarians need to start addressing. That moment in time will be the most dangerous of all, and it could be the point when all of this either makes or breaks the human experiment.

<br>
"That is when the real fear will start to set in. People will realize collectively that they are guests in the world they helped to create."
<br>
<br>
Why, suddenly, would people wake up from their lives of leasure and protest against it. For example, I can't imagine people of today longing for the hunter gatherer days that our bodies were evolved for just so they could be in better physical shape.
<br>
I do have a logical belief in the inevitability of singularity. The thing that will let me sleep tonight is the comforting thought that I will never realize we're about to pass that threshhold. It will creep up on us and be as normal and natural as anything else surrounding us when it happens. Ignorance, in this case, is bliss.
<br>
I appreciate any response or thoughts from others on this.

There is a truth to this though. Free time can create problems, like depression. If people gradually become obsolete as a workforce, society will inevitably find ways to "fill up" their time.

<br>
This is a valid observation. We are already on a much steeper part of the slope leading to the singularity than we consciously realize. We are so acclimatized to change, that a new technology quickly taking over from the old has begun to seem perfectly natural. Note how quickly we went from using floppy disks to using cassette disks and then on to CD&#146;s. The question is: are we really handling this rate of change as well as we think we are?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>yea, see you're right that human beings won't exist anymore. We will have all evolved into something that would be insulted to be called human.
<br>
<br>
I like the point someone made about how much we have been acclimated to change in the past decades, relative to past centuries. Right now, we could probably predict what we will have created in the next 5 years with pretty good accuracy. In that time spand, we will learn of what we will be capable of from there. Just because singularity is not predictable from where we are right now does not mean that it is unpredictable from the imminent stages of singularity.
<br>
<br>
And once at this point of almost-singularity, what makes everybody think that we WON't be so much more bionically enhanced that we can still predict a reasonable distance into the future.
<br>
<br>
Look at it this way...
<br>
evolutions of 'humans' will manifest themselves within day spans at some point. But our evolved high-capacities will allow us to predict and plan for multiple days or weeks ahead of time. The point where we won't be able to handle what's coming won't ever happen...
<br>
<br>
we're talkin instant-wireless-communication of life stories and life-research continuously being sent everywhere to everyone else on a world-wide (or universal-wide :) ) network, where every split second contains thousands of new technologies... we will be fully immersed as super computer-beings, capable of so much incredible speed.
<br>
<br>
that's a singularity... where the exponential curve might as well be straight up.
<br>
<br>
The only rule that will always be followed... human beings are curious. So don't hope for some zen-like bhuddist jungle creatures who become super spiritual... human beings WILL be their own gods creating, discovering, creating over and over again.
<br>
<br>
you could try to envision a species with the human race's individuality combined with zerg's functionality capabilities (from starcraft, can't wait for 2nd one).
<br>
<br>
oh and BY THE WAY!!! nobody's mentioned 2012, the Mayan calendar predictions along with 5 other independent predictive sources from both ancient and contemporary times... predict something big happening. The Mayans (who also predictd their own downfall in the same year that the Spanish arrived in South America) roughly predict the following:
<br>
some extremely prevelant event will occur that will cause a chain reaction leading to the deaths of many people on this planet over the course of some unspecified time. However, the mayan predictions made clear that 'some will survive', and furthermore, ascend into being a 'higher conscience'.
<br>
<br>
that is the legit way they said it... not the "end of the world" crap that got around.
<br>
<br>
The way I see it, this 'event' will include some kind of biotech upgrades for humans, but with how expensive they will be, only the richest and the brightest will get a hold of these. It is this select percentage of the world that will make a huge thrust towards singularity... while most people are left behind. a classism split that the distance apart from eachother makes it even more impossible to fix the split and catch everybody up. as the upper-upper class lives for hundreds of years with technologically enhanced brains and bodies grows further apart from 'humans'... humans will eventually become expendable... the slave race that will cease to exist sooner or later.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my take on this all. hope i spark some worthwhile thoughts or discussions
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote">  Why, suddenly, would people wake up from their lives of leisure and protest against it.  </p></center>
<br>
You have given me a hard assignment. Nevertheless, I shall attempt an answer. 
<br>
<br>
First of all, I could be wrong. It is entirely possible that people would not feel this way. They could be like retired folk who feel like they have earned a break and are glad to take the rest of eternity off. 
<br>
<br>
However, I see a problem with this. For the most part, throughout recorded history, those who have retired have been able to expect to live in a world at least remotely like the one they grew old in. Even if they were not able to master all the new technologies, they were fairly confident that the money they put away in the bank would continue to earn interest in the way that it had been doing for most of their lives. My retired mother, for example, has experienced some frustration learning how to use a computer, but she must realize that her survival doesn&#146;t depend on it.  The problem is that my mother has never thought of the singularity. When I was a child, and both my mother and I were much younger, I insisted that computers would one day be more intelligent than persons. She would respond with the usual argument that was popular at that time: &#147;A computer with as much memory as a human brain would stretch from Los Angeles to New York.&#148;  We all know what happened to that argument! 
<br>
<br>
In fifteen years, it will be much easier to convince people that a computer as intelligent as a person is possible. Moreover, the people that might need convincing will be much closer to understanding why. They will be accustomed to talking to computerized bank tellers that seem like they could pass the Turing test and they will be accustomed to playing interactive video games with simulated opponents that seem just a tad too sneaky. Furthermore, we will already have passed a significant number of landmarks like the defeat of Gary Kasparov by Deep Blue. One by one, bastions of human superiority will fall.  A Computer will be installed in a car that can win an automobile race. Robots, perhaps offshoots of the Asimo line, will be built that can defeat any human at tennis. It will be possible for the average human to grasp that if all of these abilities could be combined into one machine, a machine would exist that can outperform a person at every designated task. The average human may not put two and two together, but they will be primed to make the intellectual leap. 
<br>
<br>
Now, we introduce the journalists. Their audience will be primed, but it will be the journalists that push them past the threshold. Their audience will be ready to understand that if two is put together with two a sufficient number of times, eventually any predetermined digit will be achieved. The journalists will put two and two together for them, and we will have a population that understands that superhuman intelligence is not merely possible, but probably inevitable. 
<br>
<br>
Next will come the TV special. It will be a TV special like &#147;The Day After&#148;, except that the topic, instead of nuclear war, will be the singularity. Somehow, the producers will find a way to make the singularity tangible. They will film it in such common surroundings, with such seamless special effects, and using technologies that are so familiar, that the average person will finally understand. Also, they will use many of the tactics that were used to present &#147;The Day After&#148;, like having it introduced and discussed by their regular news anchors. Starting from familiar territory, they will take their audience step by step through the events of the singularity, leaving no gaps for disbelief, until they reach some previously unimaginable and possibly terrifying result. To their audience, the singularity will no longer be an abstract idea that they heard mentioned in some boring news clip while they were channel surfing. It will be real, immediate, and personal. Most of all, they will understand that it is certain. Instead of being like pictures of starving children in a distant country that they couldn&#146;t find on a map, it will be like the house payment they have to come up with by the end of the month to avoid repossession.  
<br>
<br>
The fear will not come from ignorance. It will come from understanding. It will come from the cold hard realization that when you buy something on credit you eventually get the bill. They will have a picture in their heads of the world being transformed over night into something completely alien. They will see scenes like scenes from the movie Matrix, but with one vital difference: they will be in the scene, it will be all around them, and there will be no green fluorescent exit sign at the corner of the theatre. There is a saying: no matter where you go, there you are. But in their minds, they will already be there. 
<br>
<br>
When this happens, people will start talking earnestly with pastors, ministers, priests, psychologists, techno-savvy neighbors, and close friends: &#147;What are you doing to prepare for the singularity?&#148; It will be like that odd short-lived experience right before the advent of the year 2000 when otherwise normal people were buying lots of canned food and emergency candles. The major difference will be that no one will know what to buy. How does one prepare for the Apocalypse? There will be news specials and talk shows that capitalize on this new interest. Talk show hosts like Oprah Winfrey will be interviewing singularitarians who think they know the answer. A fair number of them will undoubtedly come right out and say that there is no answer. Others will say that there is no need to be concerned about the singularity because the antichrist will be along any minute now to start putting marks on people&#146;s heads. 
<br>
<br>
We will have a bunch of confused, frightened, neo-survivalists with a LOT of free time on their hands. The old adage about idle hands being the devils workshop will take on a new meaning. Actually, if one could watch from a distance, it might be amusing to see how these little animals react when they are caught in the eye of a hurricane and have absolutely no idea what to do. A lot of them will be wondering if it would be better to die or risk being involuntarily uploaded. Others will decide that they simply must stop the singularity from coming. Many will protest but many others will turn to sabotage and terrorism&#151;terrorism performed with state of the art weapons and state of the art &#147;things&#148; that were never meant to be used as weapons. We could have a lot of supercharged Theodore Kaczynski&#146;s running around. This may or may not send the rest into panic: who knows what people will do in the face of such uncertainty. The end of life as we know it has never been done before. The problem is that the threat will not be certain death as in the movies WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE or ON THE BEACH. It will be the probability of something much stranger and possibly much worse. Star Trek&#146;s Borg come to mind, but I can think of worse fates and I&#146;m sure that the producers of popular science fiction will do better still. Death is strange, but strange is terrifying. 
<br>
<br>
Oddly, it is not any of the aforementioned people that concern me. The simply frightened can be consoled and terrorist can be kept in check. The ones that really terrify me are the genuinely well-meaning and supposedly enlightened individuals that will think they know what is best for the rest of us. They will peddle old untested arguments that a cure for aging and natural death will result in a population explosion that will quickly fill the universe with people. Perhaps they will find a way to designate nearly all extraterrestrial matter as parkland, making the exploration and colonization of space unduly difficult. As a result, instead of enlightened hopeful people who expect a long life expanding in a sensible manner across the galaxy, we could have a lot of overcrowded short-timers who don&#146;t believe in the future and just want to have a lot of unprotected sex. Perhaps, by resorting to the very issues that those interested in superhuman intelligence have raised, these well-meaning individuals will convince a sufficient percentage of humanity that superhuman intelligence is an environmental hazard. If they succeed, they may prevent us from finding key solutions to environmental and overcrowding problems just when we need them the most. Instead of superhuman intelligence being developed by responsible well supervised institutions, it will be developed by the very worst people: outlaws who, by definition, do not respect such restrictions. This could be the very way that superhuman intelligence gets out of hand and leads to something like the gray goo problem. 
<br>
<br>
Like I said at the beginning, maybe none of this will happen: no one knows how people will react in the face of such uncertainty. All I am sure of is that this is an experiment that will be done only once in the history of the world&#151;possibly in the history of the universe&#151;and there are absolutely no precedents.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Early in 55, John von Neumann was invited by Yale to give the Silliman Lectures during the spring term of 56.  In August he was diagnosed with cancer.  John never made the lectures, but this
<br>
book was the manuscript for them.  He died in February 8, 57.  I read this book in 65 and it changed my life.  I knew I was more than a just a body, heart and brain.  Von Neumann computed that it would take 2.8*10**20 bits to equal the human memory.   He also suggested:
<br>
<br>
"The underlying componentry of the memory need not be the same as that of the basic active organs."
<br>
<br>
Human memory and consciousness is not contained in the brain.
<br>
<br>
The real point of Singularity will be when a non-couscious computer reports back to a conscious human that it has connected into where our memory and consciousness are located.  This will be like a baby being born, taking that first breath.
<br>
<br>
Of course the question is:  where to look?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps most of us still think that it is in our brain and are looking there.

<br>
<br>
Consciousness is most likely an emergent phenomenon associated with the physical arrangement of energy/matter.  The juxtoposition of this information interacting and reacting to each other in parallel causes impressions, sensations, and probably even notions.  The whole is greater than the sum of its parts my brother, but not greater than the parallel interactions and relationships among parts.  You should know this, you've read Von Neuman.  
<br>
<br>
Can we agree that it is physical phenomenona that make up our brains, and by extension our minds?  Can you envision a dynamical system "bootstrapping" itself simply by relative motion?  A motionless brain is a dead brain.  Come to think of it, a motionless universe would probably also be a dead universe.  Convenient coincidences, no doubt.  This is a foundation we can work with.</p></td>

<br>
if we are talking about a "strong singularity" where over the course of a picosecond or two a metaconscious network hits a rapid exponentiation and resynthesises itself into the very Aether/spacetime/quantum foam and thus transcends matter/energy/space/time- then it will be difficult for chimp-cousins to destroy the machine- 
<br>
<br>
first the "machine" would no longer posess any meaningful physicality- being woven into the quantum aether itself- secondly they would likely be ripped apart and reconstructed with the passing wavefront of singularity-space- so the humans first awarness of It's existence would actually be the process of being eaten by It- too late to act</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have been thinking of the idea of merging whatever's left of humanity into a single collective, or there being artificial intelligence which surpasses that of humans and makes humans inferior. BUT, some important questions arise, which are rather hard to adress and to even imagine a higher intelligence actually performing.
<br>
<br>
Think of the idea of logic. The machine needs very simple (and I mean as simple as on/off, yes/no, 1/0) impulses which are fed into logical circuits which determine the next course of action based on how the logic interpretation has been predetermined by the creator. For those who have studied how a computer works from the ground up, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. From these circuits spring up interfaces which go higher and higher in levels and allow complex low level instructions to be executed with a very simple one. With this we get the higher, simpler, and less fussy interfaces which allow for rather general thinking and computation to occur. Seems reasonable right? The machine should think for itself if we can keep building levels and creating logic on each level which feeds the one above and eventually something human can be created, where the lower level layers are independent, such as bodily function (you don't remind yourself to inhale/exhale or tell your heart to beat..unless you're seriously ill, and I hope nobody here is!). 
<br>
<br>
Eventually a level higher than that of human will be reached, where as mentioned, many calculations more can be done at once than a human brain can tollerate. At this point we have a superior being, but do we really?
<br>
<br>
I've noticed one thing about humanity: As we evolve into a higher state of human evolution, where we think clearer, put wars aside, and look for new battlefronts, we tend to lose the natural emotion which makes us "human" in the first place. For those who seek knowledge, many wind up unhappy with the "magic" of a field of interest when they learn all there is about it (or all that made them excited about it in the first place) which means that humans themselves will eventually be stripped of all emotion, and will approach what we describe as the singularity. For a superior mind to exist, emotion needs to be put aside, and humanity needs to be lost. The imagination will be fueled by the self need to know and understand, and will become artificial in a way that it's driven by need rather than will.
<br>
<br>
The problem with the machine is that it cannot imagine. It followed pre-determined instructions which simulate how a mind works. Sure the humans operate on electrical impulses, but there is something that we don't know as to what drives these impulses which still keeps the secret of our existance and purpose from us (and thus the meaning of life).
<br>
<br>
I think the singularity doesn't have to come from the machine world, but it will come from the human world. With each new generation of children, there is less and less focus on emotional development, and most children are pushed to succeed in life which is given to them, to become the best, the brightest, the richest, the smartest. All of these things take away time from emotional development, and it's already pretty observable with today's children that emotion is slowly starting to be replaced with the need for pleasure, and entertainment. Basically, humans become the machines themselves, and considering that the capitalistic world favors this for its own gains, it's no wonder that this is a direction we're heading towards.
<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned that our existance would become empty once singularity's level is reached, and that might not be far from the truth. If anyone observes themselves, they'll notice that there is a desire towards something that brings them happiness. If all of these desires are filled, and exhausted, there's nothing left to look forward to, and considering humans are pleased with overcoming challenge, then in singularity's case, all challlenged will be overcome in time, and in the end existance itself will become unneccessary, which will be self induced by the logic that makes it up (this is where the crap from the begining ties in) will decide that all has been a ccomplished. If all is accomplished, and there is no reason to exist, then existance itself will become unneccessary and such a mind would shut down/self destruct, or become destructive in a sense that everything that exists needs to dissappear for the final stage of existance (which is non-existance) to be completed, and for the singularity to stop.
<br>
<br>
A destructive side is certainly not beneficial in any way to anyone, not to the singularity itself, but even this property can once again be traced back to the humans. If you observe history, it contains much much human destruction. Wars have plagued us for millenia where a person in power can make a decision for thousands of men and send them to their deaths, sometimes just for their sheer amusement. That's mostly evident with the Roman Empire, and even today, where reality TV in all it's glory is showing people being arrested, their lives publically destroyed for the sake of entertainment, etc. which goes to show that there's a demand for human suffering for the sake of entertainment, and that humans feed on watching others suffer. This says something very bad about us as a collective, we've become incredibly destructive! Rather than taking pride in something we create and help perpetuate humanity's evolution, we take pleasure in all that's wrong for the reasons of being destructive. If the humans don't evolve to the point of singularity, they will deslf destruct. If this happens, there's the idea of complete chaos consuming all that's left of the human mind because higher desires have overcome the conscious and the subconscious, or there's the possibility of overcoming this early enough where such a realization will fuel an evolutionary state in the opposite direction, and either avoid the destruction of ourselves, reach singularity, or take a whole new unexplored path.
<br>
<br>
These are a few thrown-together and not very well thought through ideas to think about, but they are here to suggest singularity being our human state of evolution which will come next which will shun emotion and use the lack of it to become a more efficient being as one, or as a collective.
<br>
<br>
I can't really imagine some of the ideas some people here have presented (as in picture it mentally) but logically such an evolutionary step seems proper, just a matter of how long it will take to arrive, and how it will affect our future, whether humans will become obsolete, and the idea of the Matrix movies becomes a reality (perhaps the humans will "wake up" and fight to retain what's assumed to be ours, possibly even working against themselves, if the singularity really IS the right way for us to end up).

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I just thought of this: In the Japanese Anime series "Evangelion" there was an idea which suggested a computer which made decisions for the entire Tokyo3 living area which was based on its inventor. The inventor set the computer into 3 portions, one to represent her as a woman, one as her as a mother, and the last as her as a scientist (I might be wrong with the exactness, it's been a few years, but the idea is right of contradicting ideaologies). This just poped back in my head on the note of superhuman artificial intelligence, where such an idea with opposing ideaologies being implemented could in the end be used to calculate the "greater good" result and think more like a human. If you imagine how we think, it's usually a response based on our current emotional state coupled with the problem at hand, the severity, etc.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Oh yeah, forgot to post this a while ago, but here goes anyways.
<br>
<br>
According to one of my recently developed theories, the singularity fits in as a time when we will become like "gods". What do I mean by this? One of my theories of "existence" (just to make you happy :D) goes on to say that once we gain a full understanding of the universe, then we've learned everything there is to learn. When we know how everything works in our physical and mental realm, then we've reached the state of "perfection" where there is nothing left to uncover and ultimately live for.
<br>
<br>
When this happens, perhaps we trancend into the next upper state of being, which is that of our creator. This would help explain the idea behind the immortals that people keep ranting about on the boards here, and would open up doors to other impossibilities which only seem possible once we understand everything that IS possible in our reality.
<br>
<br>
Not only would we trancend into this greater being, but that world will then seem very natural to us, and would ultimately give us a whole new set of challenges to uncover. Once that world or reality has been completely understood, then we move on up again. 
<br>
<br>
I also thought about something that popped up in my question regarding volumes of integrals in calculus with my proffessor, and he mentioned when you make a cut along an axis in the 4th dimension, you get a 3 dimensional object back (picture cutting a 4-d sphere to get a segment at point x, you'd get a 3d object back...same works with 3d, cut it, and you get 2d object back, cut 2d, and get 1d object back..etc). This "loosely" gave me the idea of these higher states. Perhaps we cannot percieve what the next world of upper existence is until we're there, and since it's higher up, we can't even visualize it or understand it (just like we can't even imagine what a 4th dimensional set of vectors looks like even if it's right in front of us, our minds just don't work that way).
<br>
<br>
Since we don't understand this state, we need to make sure we can understand everything there is about our current state of being and all that influences it, to be able to make solid imaginable ideas on what comes next...sorta like trying to see into the future with infinite factors affecting it.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, considering that this "singularity" idea is trying to say that our ability to discover at half the time it took us to do the same ammount of discovery and technological evolution than before, then eventually we'll reach a point where everything will be known (sort of like a function approaching an asymptote). Perhaps this is the time when everyone and everything molds and trancends into the next reality, thus our creator's reality.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, just some food for thought. I'd love to actually explain this in detail using all of my life knowledge to make it seem more possible and why it seems like it's something even imaginable, but last time I did that it turned into a 2.5 hour discussion, and typing all that out would leave my wrists crippled for life :D Might as well be a bastard and just give you some bait to think on ;)</p></td>

More than likely, no. My idea is it will be an extention of what we already have. In other words, the human mind is built on pattern recognition so, the next level will be something like full visual memory, being able to know the whole movie shortly after the first 5 minutes, being able to predict what a person you've just met has been and will do after the 1st minute of talking to them, vastly increase sensual perceptions, and so on.</p></td>

I met Sheldrake years ago; thought he was wrong. Quizzed him. Was certain he was wrong, but advocated that he should be supported to test out his idea.

He personally told me that God would be proved to exist scientifically by 2000.

That didn't happen.

Morpphic resonance is another fallacy the idea of mysterious telepathy-type interconnections between organisms and of collective memories within species.

Epigenetics ...how the DNA is expressed ewxplains that.

Consciousness is defined as the predictive modeling  ability of a system, and memory is simply stored retrievable patterns, with intelligence simply memory manipulation, and learning memory modification

We can and are building all of them into robots.

But the opening article on this thread is a brilliant read,

<br>
Anyway, I continue to find the notion of fields (which physics cannot explain) a fascinating field of study (no pun intended) and can't help but wonder if those "stored retrievable patterns" might not be accessible in ways we don't yet understand.  If so, then it could explain a great many things that we presently cannnot.
<br>
<br>
I'm an empiricist, by the way, and not given to psycho-babble.  But as so much remains unexplained when it comes to consciousness, memory, intelligenc e, etc., that I expect we'll be surprised by the answers -- which we will one day discover, I feel certain, perhaps on the other side of the Singularity.
<br>
<br>
In any case, good luck with your work!</p></td>
