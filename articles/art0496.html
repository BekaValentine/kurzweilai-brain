<div class="TeaserText">Reverse-engineering the human brain is doomed to failure because of the "Turing fallacy" -- a nonbiological computation system could never precisely copy the complex neural, structural, and chemical functions of a brain or achieve the required level of reliability, says Thomas Ray, who proposes evolution of "non-Turing" AIs as an alternative</div>

<p>There are numerous directions from which to criticize Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              proposal for <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>. In this essay I will focus on his failure 
              to consider the unique <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium when discussing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. But before elaborating on this point, I 
              would like briefly to call attention to some other issues. </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Psychic <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum Mechanics</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Kurzweil&#8217;s interpretation of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> leads him to 
              the conclusion that &#8220;consciousness, <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> are 
              inextricably linked.&#8221; While this is true in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> arises from the interactions of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, 
              it is not true in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that Kurzweil intends it: that quantum 
              ambiguities are not resolved until they are forced to do so by a 
              conscious observer.</p>
<p>Kurzweil&#8217;s error is most glaringly apparent in his description 
              of the paper output from a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>: &#8220;So the page with 
              the answer is ambiguous, undetermined&#8212;until and unless a conscious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> looks at it. Then instantly all the ambiguity is retroactively 
              resolved, and the answer is there on the page. The implication is 
              that the answer is not there until we look at it.&#8221; He makes 
              the same error in describing the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>: &#8220;From 
              one perspective of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>&#8212;we could say that any 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> that fails to evolve conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to apprehend its <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> 
              never existed in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurzweil does not understand that it is the act of measurement 
              that causes the collapse of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> function, not conscious observation 
              of the measurement. In practice, the collapse is (probably always) 
              caused by a completely unconscious measuring <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Printing of 
              the result on a paper could be such a measuring <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Subsequent 
              conscious observation of the measurement is irrelevant.</p>
<p>This psychic <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> did not originate with Kurzweil. 
              It has been around for decades, apparently as a way to deal with 
              Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a>. Thus, Kurzweil may be able to point 
              to physicists who hold this view. Similarly, I could point to biologists 
              who believe in the biblical story of creation rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of experts who believe a doctrine, however, is no 
              argument for the truth of the doctrine.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Colloquial <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">Chaos</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Kurzweil&#8217;s suggestion that in a process, the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> interval 
              between <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> events expands or contracts along with the amount 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> (&#8220;the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_time_and_chaos_entry.html">law of time and chaos</a>&#8221;), is quite interesting. 
              Yet, the definitions of &#8220;salient events&#8221; and &#8220;chaos&#8221; 
              are quite subjective, making the &#8220;law&#8221; difficult to support. 
              Technically, it would probably be more appropriate to use the word 
              &#8220;entropy&#8221; in place of &#8220;chaos,&#8221; but for consistency, 
              I will also use &#8220;chaos&#8221; in this discussion.</p>
<p>Most striking is the apparently inconsistent use of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. He states 
              that in an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> increases, and he says: &#8220;Evolution 
              draws upon the <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> in the larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in which it takes place 
              for its options for <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>.&#8221; Yet he states that in the development 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> increases, and he says: &#8220;The 
              development of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion as a single <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> through 
              maturation is a process moving toward greater <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> and thus 
              greater disorder.&#8221; Kurzweil suggests that in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> 
              implies <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, while in development, <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> implies disorder.</p>
<p>Through <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> has increased, 
              and through development, the <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> types increases. 
              I would characterize both as processes that generate <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. Why 
              does Kurzweil think that development generates chaos? His apparent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> is to make his <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_time_and_chaos_entry.html">law of time and chaos</a> consistent with our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> of time: Our subjective unit of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> grows with our age.</p>
<p>I believe that the scientific community would generally agree that 
              the developmental process up to the period of reproduction is a 
              process of increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. In humans, who live well beyond their 
              reproductive years, the condition of the body begins to deteriorate 
              after the reproductive years, and this senescence would generally 
              be considered a process of increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>.</p>
<p>In an effort to fit development seamlessly into his law of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, Kurzweil presents the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle from <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, as unidirectional, towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>. This position 
              is indefensible. The developmental process directly contradicts 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_time_and_chaos_entry.html">law of time and chaos</a>. Development is a process in which the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> events increases with <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>.</p>
<p>He attempts to be clear and concrete in his use of the term chaos: 
              &#8220;If we&#8217;re dealing with the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-forms, 
              then <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> represents the unpredictable events encountered by <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s, 
              and the random mutations that are introduced in the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>.&#8221; 
              He explains: &#8220;Evolution draws upon the great <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> in its midst&#8212;the 
              ever increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> governed by the flip side of the Law of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> and Chaos&#8212;for its options for innovation.&#8221; This implies 
              that unpredictable events and mutations are becoming more frequent, 
              a position that would be difficult to defend. His argument is that 
              increasing rates of mutations and unpredictable events are, in part, 
              driving the increasing frequency of &#8220;salient events&#8221; in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. He does not provide any support for this highly questionable 
              argument.</p>
<p>Despite his attempt to be precise, his use of &#8220;chaos&#8221; 
              is vernacular: &#8220;When the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> was just a &#8216;naked&#8217; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> . . . there was no <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>.&#8221; &#8220;As the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> 
              grew in size, <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> increased exponentially.&#8221; &#8220;Now with 
              billions of galaxies sprawled out over trillions of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-years 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> contains vast reaches of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> . . .&#8221; 
              &#8220;We start out as a single fertilized <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, so there&#8217;s 
              only rather limited <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> there. Ending up with trillions of cells, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> greatly expands.&#8221; It seems that he associates <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> with 
              size, a very unconventional use of the term.</p>
<p>His completely false interpretation of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, his vague 
              and inconsistent use of terms such as &#8220;chaos&#8221; and &#8220;salient 
              events,&#8221; and his failure to understand the thermodynamics of 
              development represent errors in the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> from which he 
              constructs his view of the world. These misunderstandings of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> seriously undermine the credibility of his arguments.</p>
<p>I am not comfortable with the equation of technological development 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. I think that most <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary biologists would consider 
              these to be quite separate processes, yet, their equation represents 
              a point of view consistent with Kurzweil&#8217;s arguments and also 
              consistent with the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of &#8220;meme&#8221; developed by the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary biologist <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Medium</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The primary criticism that I wish to make of Kurzweil&#8217;s book, 
              however, is that he proposes to create intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s by copying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains into <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. We might call this the Turing Fallacy. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> suggests that we can know that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have become 
              intelligent when we cannot distinguish them from <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, in free 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> over a teletype. The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> is one of the biggest 
              red-herrings in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>It reminds me of early cinema when we <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> a camera in front of 
              a stage and filmed a play. Because the cinema medium was new, we 
              really didn&#8217;t understand what it is and what we can do with 
              it. At that point we completely misunderstood the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the 
              medium of cinema. We are in almost the same position today with 
              respect to the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium.</p>
<p>Over and over again, in a variety of ways, we are shaping <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> 
              in the form of the 3D material <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> that we inhabit. But <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> 
              is not a material <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and it is not inherently 3D. The idea of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> into a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is yet another example 
              of failing to understand and work with the properties of the medium. 
              Let me give some other examples and then come back to this.</p>
<p>I have heard it said that <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> is a place for the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, yet 
              we feel compelled to take our bodies with us. 3D virtual worlds 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s are manifestations of this. I have seen virtual worlds 
              where you walk down streets lined by buildings. In one I saw a Tower 
              Records store, whose front looked like the real thing. You approached 
              the door, opened it, entered, and saw rows of CDs on racks and an 
              escalator to take you to the next floor. Just Like The Real Thing!</p>
<p>I saw a demo of Alpha World, built by hundreds of thousands of 
              mostly teenagers. It was the day after Princess Diana died, and 
              there were many memorials to her, bouquets of flowers by fountains, 
              photos of Diana with messages. It looked Just Like The Real memorials 
              to Diana.</p>
<p>I wondered, why do these worlds look and function as much as possible 
              like the real thing? This is <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, where we can do anything. 
              We can move from point A to point B instantly without passing through 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> in between. So why are we forcing ourselves to walk down 
              streets and halls and to open doors?</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">Cyberspace</a> is not a 3D Euclidean <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. It is not a material world. 
              We are not constrained by the same laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, unless we impose 
              them upon ourselves. We need to liberate our minds from what we 
              are familiar with before we can use the full potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>. 
              Why should we compute collision avoidance for <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s in virtual 
              worlds when we have the alternative to find out how many <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s 
              can dance on the head of a pin?</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">WWW</a> is a good counter-example, because it recognizes that in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> it doesn&#8217;t <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> where something is physically 
              located. <a class="thought" href="entries/amazon_entry.html">Amazon.com</a> is a good alternative to the mindlessly familiar 
              3D Tower Record store.</p>
<p>Let me come back to Kurzweil&#8217;s ideas on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. Kurzweil states 
              that it is &#8220;ultimately feasible&#8221; to: </p>

              vesicles, and other neural <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. Its entire organization could

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This passage most clearly illustrates Kurzweil&#8217;s version of 
              the Turing Fallacy. It is not only infeasible to &#8220;copy&#8221; 
              a complex organic organ into <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> without losing its function, 
              but it is the least imaginative approach to creating an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. How 
              do we copy a seratonin <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> or a presynaptic vesicle into <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>? 
              This passage of the book does not explicitly state whether he is 
              proposing a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> simulation from the molecular level up, of 
              a copy of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, or if he is proposing the construction of actual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, vesicles, <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s, and their wiring together 
              into an exact copy of a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Yet in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of 
              the preceding discussion, it appears that he is proposing the latter.</p>
<p>Such a proposal is doomed to failure. It would be a fantastic task 
              to map the entire physical, chemical, and dynamic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Even if this could be accomplished, there would be no <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> 
              for building a copy. There is no known <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for building complexly 
              differentiated microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s on such a large scale. If 
              a re-construction <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> existed, we might expect that a copy made 
              of the same materials, <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, if somehow jump-started 
              into the proper dynamic activity, would have the same function (though 
              such a copied <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> would require a body to support it). But a copy 
              made of metallic materials could not possibly have the same function. 
              It would be a fantastically complex and intricate dynamic sculpture, 
              whose function would bear no relation to a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. And what 
              of the body and its essential sensory integration with the brain? 
            </p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> for the metallic &#8220;copy&#8221; to have the same function, 
              we would have to abstract the functional properties out of the organic 
              neural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, and find <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s and processes in the new metallic 
              medium that provide identical functions. This <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> and functional-structural 
              translation from the organic into the metallic medium would require 
              a deep understanding of the natural neural processes, combined with 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of many computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and processes which do not 
              yet exist.</p>
<p>However, Kurzweil has stated that one advantage of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-copy 
              approach is that &#8220;we don&#8217;t need to understand all of it; 
              we need only to literally copy it.&#8221; Yet he is ambivalent on 
              this critical point, adding: &#8220;To do this right, we do need 
              to understand what the <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing mechanisms 
              are. Much of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>&#8217;s elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> exists to support 
              its own structural integrity and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> processes and does not directly 
              contribute to its handling of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> or its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s cannot 
              be separated. The circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> provides <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> support for the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, but it also delivers hormones that are an integral part of 
              the chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The membrane 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> is a structural feature defining the limits and integrity 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, but it is also the surface along which depolarization 
              propagates signals. The structural and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-support functions cannot 
              be separated from the handling of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a chemical organ, with a broad spectrum of chemical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> mechanisms ranging from microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s 
              precisely delivered at target <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s, to <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> oxide gas and 
              hormones spread through the circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> or diffusing through 
              the intercellular medium of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. There also exist a wide range 
              of chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s with intermediate degrees of 
              specificity of delivery. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> has evolved its exquisitely subtle 
              and complex functionality based on the properties of these chemical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. A metallic <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> operates on fundamentally 
              different dynamic properties and could never precisely and exactly 
              &#8220;copy&#8221; the function of a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>The materials of which <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are constructed have fundamentally 
              different physical, chemical, and electrical properties than the 
              materials from which the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is constructed. It is impossible 
              to create a &#8220;copy&#8221; of an organic <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> out of the materials 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. This applies not only to the proposition of copying 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with such accuracy as to replicate a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> along with its memories, but also to the somewhat less extreme 
              proposition of creating an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">Structure</a>s and processes suitable for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing in 
              the organic medium are fundamentally different from those of the 
              metallic <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al medium. Intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al medium must be based on fundamentally different 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s and processes, and thus cannot be copied from organic 
              brains.</p>
<p>I see three separate processes which are sometimes confounded.

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A large portion of Kurzweil&#8217;s book establishes the first process 
              by extrapolating Moore&#8217;s Law into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> until <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can perform the same <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s per second 
              as is estimated for the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (~2020 A.D.).</p>
<p>I accept that this level of computing power is likely to be reached, 
              someday. But no amount of raw <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power will be intelligent 
              in the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> unless it is properly organized. This is a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> problem, not a <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> problem. The organizational <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> does not march forward according to Moore&#8217;s Law.</p>
<p>While I can accept that computing power will inevitably reach <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              levels, I am not confident that computing performance will certainly 
              follow. The exponential increase of computing power is driven by 
              higher densities and greater <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s on chips, not 
              by exponentially more complex <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> designs.</p>
<p>The most complex of <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s designed and built by humans are 
              much less complex that living <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s. Yet the most complex of 
              our creations are showing alarming failure rates. Orbiting satellites 
              and telescopes, <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttles, interplanetary probes, the Pentium 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s, all seem to be pushing the limits 
              of what we can effectively design and build through conventional 
              approaches.</p>
<p>It is not certain that our most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s will be able 
              to increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> by an additional one, two or more orders 
              of magnitude, in pace with computing power. Our most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s) already 
              contains tens of millions of lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. At present it seems 
              unlikely that we can produce and manage <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> with hundreds of 
              millions or billions of lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. In fact there is no evidence 
              that we will ever be able to design and build intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p>This leads to the next distinction, which is central to my argument, 
              and requires some explanation:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) computing performance equal to the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a></p>

<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> medium it was <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> that explored the possibilities 
              inherent in the medium, and created the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> listens

              limited by <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>.</p>
<p>I propose the creation of a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of wildlife

              This would be a place where <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> can spontaneously generate

              and market analysts telling it what the target applications are.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> naturalists can then explore this cyber-<a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> 
              of applications for the products of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in the same 
              way that our ancestors found applications among the products of 
              organic <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> such as: rice, wheat, corn, chickens, cows, <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s, 
              silk, mahogany. But, of course, the applications that we might find 
              in the living <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world would not be material; they would be 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes.</p>
<p>It is possible that out of this <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> there might emerge 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, truly rooted in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the medium, 
              rather than brutishly copied and <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed from organic <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. 
              It would be a fundamentally alien <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, but one which would 
              complement rather than duplicate our talents and abilities.</p>
<p>I think it would be fair to say that the main point of Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              book is that artificial entities with <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> equal to and 
              greater than humans will inevitably arise, in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. While 
              his detailed explanation of how this might happen focuses on what 
              I consider to be the Turing Fallacy, that is, that it will initially 
              take a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> form, Kurzweil would probably be <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> with any route 
              to these higher <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s, Turing or non-Turing.</p>
<p>While I feel that AIs must certainly be non-Turing&#8212;unlike 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s&#8212;I feel ambivalent about whether they will 
              emerge at all. It is not the certainty that Kurzweil paints, like 
              the inexorable march of Moore&#8217;s Law. Raw computing power is 
              not <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Our ability ever to create <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> comparable to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> is completely unproven 
              and absolutely uncertain.</p>
<p>I have suggested <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> as an alternate approach to producing 
              intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes. These evolved AIs would certainly 
              be non-Turing AIs. Yet <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium remains a 
              process with a very limited record of accomplishments. We have been 
              able to establish active <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary processes, by both natural 
              and artificial selection in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium. But the evolving 
              entities have always contained at most several thousand bits of 
              genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>We do not yet have a measure on the potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in this 
              medium. If we were to realize a potential within several orders 
              of magnitude of that of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, it would be a spectacular 
              success. But if the potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> falls ten orders 
              of magnitude below organic <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, then <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> will 
              lose its luster. There is as yet no evidence to suggest which outcome 
              is more likely.</p>
<p>The hope for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> as a route to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is not only that it would 
              produce an <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> rooted in and natural to the medium, but 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium is capable of generating levels 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> comparable to what it has produced in the organic 
              medium. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> is the only process that is proven to be able 
              to generate such levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. That proof, however, is in 
              the organic rather than the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium. Like an artist who can 
              express his <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> in oil paint but not stone sculpture, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              may be capable of magnificent creations in the organic medium but 
              not the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>.</p>
<p>Yet the vision of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of vast <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is still 
              out there, waiting for realization or disproof. It should encourage 
              us, although we are at the most rudimentary level of our <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> medium. Nevertheless, the possibilities 
              are great enough to merit a serious and sustained effort.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The present is a deeply personal moment. And for Ray Kurzweil, so deep and understood it is that only people who venture in proximity to his event horizon of consciousness - the border of his self-sustained solipsist integrity - will ever be able to moderately understand it. I think he's applied his understanding of quantum mechanics appropriately to his discussion of consciousness and predictability concerning the human mind. 
<br>
Consciousness has its limitations. Take for instance your (the reader's) personal "now state." I'd be willing to bet that you were not considering the cardiac pulsations in your left index finger. Yet, given the time, you can focus on it implying that it is now an object of your consciousness. But considering that your consciousness has a limitation to its scope, what thoughts, feelings, etc. did it leave behind in order to make "space" for the new ponderings about your index finger? Essentially our consciousness has a focus, which isn't new news to people, but something that I felt needed a quick mention before relating to both Kurzweils discussion and this following illustration of my own. 
<br>
<br>
To what extent does the underlying carpet of quantum fluctuations influence our beings?
<br>
<br>
Engineers are often fond of chopping off a string of numbers that might go on for 43 decimal places before stopping. Aside from being a practice of scientific notation, they reason, "What use are these 43 decimals but to cause confusion in my calculation, especially if I can round them to three decimal places and get the same apparent results as is I had included them- a standing bridge with steel of tensile strength 125,000 psi?" 
<br>
<br>
Similarly, what if we are to consider our focused consciousness to be like probabilistic clouds generated upon the sure-firing cumulative thresholds of excitations responsible for that directed attention? In other words, if our nerves have a threshold of depolarization (or hyper-polarization as within the retina) then once we direct our consciousness towards a certain subject matter, the primary bell curve of physical thresholds take precedence over that of the periphery ones and our attention is sustained until otherwise directed. Such a Cloud of Influence (COI) is commanded by the observable relativistic center core of energy, the firing thresholds. Within the fringes of the Gaussian curve denoting this cloud is the inevitable overlap into yet a second realm, the Cloud of Subconscious Variability (CSV). This CSV operates differently because it does not have the dominating influence of the relativistic excited thresholds within the COI. The CSV therefore lies closer to the carpet of quantum fluctuations and therefore the opportunity for it to be influenced by such quantum fluctuations is increased, but not inevitable and perhaps highly improbable, given the mathematical dynamics of this scale of physics, of which I am not a master. (A spaceship 1,000 miles above Earth may have a better probability to be influenced by Jupiter's gravity than if it was upon an Earth-based launch-pad, but is still more likely to fall back to Earth than zoom away to Jupiter, if the physical conditions of its motion limit it from doing so.) 
<br>
<br>
In any case, to what extent, if any, can we neglect the small overlapping of Gaussian clouds and focus solely on the core of relativistic threshold firings at the center of our consciousness WITHOUT affecting the PATH of this core to our beings? Is there a place on the infinite outcomes (until observed) timeline that we can say, hey, if when copying the mind of a human we chop off that string of probabilities up to this nth decimal point, it won't really matter because he will remain the same person and those lesser probabilities were frivolous anyhow. I think it's likely that there's a "T Point" above the Planc Unit where a form of determinism arises and human behavior can emerge out of the realm of probability and into the marble universe that Einstein was eager to construct. 
<br>
And my interpretation of this geometry of consciousness is similar to that of Chinese handcuffs (looks like I'm on the Asian theme today.) There's a more modern version of these reed-woven finger traps that uses Nilon as its material. These nilon "boingy springs" (as I refer to them) has a tube-within-a-tube geometry such that you can push the inner tube through and eventually it will circle around the outside of the structure. (I really wish I had a picture to illustrate this thought.) Now consider this to be similar to our geometrical consciousness, where it's core rests at the very center of this innermost tube, only in OUR case there are multiple tubes having multiple orientations (probabilities) (about 20 million billion, in fact) but each capable of achieving that same outward folding motion, all at the same time, which sounds physically impossible at first. However, instead of these things being tubes, consider the inner tube of all of these omni-oriented springs to cone-in "pinch" from both directions onto the central point of consciousness. The reason why our consciousnesses would not be frozen in time is because in actuality, this three-dimensional representation of the geometry of consciousness is actually my attempt to illustrate my feelings of three dimensional motion within a forth dimensional realm.
<br>
<br>
Consciousness and time merge at this point. The varrying probabilities of chaotic fractal representations are what comprise reality, and in so doing the creation of an adult human from a fetus is actually farther down the line of chaotic evolution than the original fetal mass because it has had to venture down the periscope of fractal examination.
<br>
<br>
If we are then to consider the structures of the 3-dimensional motion-based Universe, black holes, big bangs, red shifts, etc. I think it would be in our grasp to evaluate how they are connected to our present-day state of consciousness, that being within the "knee-joint" of the exponential. 
<br>
<br>
(((((((tangent(((((I also think a separate interpretation of the photo-electric effect explaining why energy can be represented as both a particle and a wave is that the three dimensional geometry around a particle can actually create movement around particle depending on viewing the interpretation of the dimensions around the particle...  sort of to say that there is a dual interpretation of the geometry and in so-being, the geometry oscillates around the stationary particle, the particle emerging from the forth dimension as an energy "packet."  In essense the "wave part" of the photoelectric effect could actually be a birdged-representation of the geometry of space.)))))see my diagram)))I guess I can't attach it))ask and I will send))))))))) 
<br>
<br>
On Technology and Intelligence 
<br>
<br>
I think that Thomas Ray has made some valid points concerning the dilemmas of replicating the abilities of a human mind with that of a computer. However there is one thing that I would like to point out. I believe that consciousness is separate from intelligence BUT connected by the common thread of individual reality... much like the way a set of ninja numb chucks has two distinct batons connected by a common chain.... throw one baton up into the air and the other one hasn't a choice but to follow, yet each baton, if you hold them in separate hands, can be moved in different directions in so much that they do not break the bonds of reality. Intelligence and consciousness... like a bird's two dexterous wings connected by a single body.
<br>
<br>
To make this crucial separation between intelligence and consciousness is to shed light on what will happen once scientists use binary computers to begin the process of mapping a humans inner entity onto a computer. A binary-type computer will have to faaaarrrrr exceed the computational capacity of a human mind to even come close to a consciousness of similar proportions to that of a humans because the human mind obviously runs on something more powerful and flexble than a binary code. 
<br>
For instance (although consciousness is much more than a visual experience) consider two TV screens of equal area one with nine times the pixel density than the other. Lets suppose that the one with greater pixel density is analogous to a human while one of lesser density is analogous to computer. Lets also suppose that a signal is sent to the televisions and each has the computational capacity (intelligence) to decipher the information and send it to their monitors. Let's say this signal is analogous to reality and pixel density is analogous to consciousness. There is one more catch to this scenario: these tv's also have feedback loops to their memory faculties. The purposes of these memory faculties is to record which pixel was illuminated. If a signal is sent to pixel areas A4 for both machines, A4 will definitely illuminate for the computer, while a sequence of 1/9 subunits is to illuminate for the human, depending upon it's initial states.  Therefore the human will have a more selective feedback experience.  In such a way, because of the intrinsic nature of the outputs (binary vs. ninary, if you will), their intelligences are equal yet their consciousness are not. 
<br>
<br>
I don't know if I've made complete sense here, but what I initially set out to do was to say that similar to when I'm sitting here in my chair witnessing first hand my own reality, even if I new that a computer reflection was here sharing my consciousness in tandem within me, because it is based on a binary mechanism of data retrieval whereas my mind is based on a more advanced (but not infinite) method of data retrieval, the computer might be able to match my level of intelligence by shadowing itself within the core of relativistic threshold firings, but not equal my level of consciousness, and therefore would be analogous to a tv screen that was destined to only give one interpretation of the data that it received. 
<br>
The next logical question would then become, well if the equally intelligent computer has a lesser degree of consciousness than its copied human counterpart, what level of computational intelligence is needed for it's consciousness to be on par with that of a human (how far must it exceed that of the human brain)? The answer lies within my Cloud of Influence (the directional vector of consciousness) model that is analogous to what I think Kurzweil is claiming. If we are able to match the algorithms sufficiently such that the Cloud of Influence is preserved and matched in its outcomes, then the computers will have reached a state where its consciousness has matched that of humans. In so doing it would take a hyper-intelligent binary computer to match the consciousness of a super-intelligent multiple-state human brain. We will have shed the burdens of nutritinal sustenance and gotten down to the crux of our goal: organized electron vectoring.
<br>
<br>
Will Moore's Law extend the computational power of a binary system to the point where these hyper-computers can sufficiently account for human consciousness? Or maybe it is more encouraging to work from the other end of the spectrum, with quantum computers as the focus of investigation? 
<br>
I favor the later one for it's malleability, though wouldn't rule out the binary method in case of emergencies. For instance, if while concentrating on my finger, certain outcomes of predictability are occurring, I could take a snap shot of my mind here and consider the highest probability of that particular mindset recorded. Then if I chose to turn my attention to a different aspect of who I am, perhaps my patented way of rambling on about things, take a snapshot of it, I would then have two gems of highest probabilties. Continue to do this again and again and again, and I would start to map my entire conscious domain... perhaps I would even chose to remove that memory of my 3 year old birthday AFTER mapping into binary, such that it would not interfere with the continual process of mapping new regions long since forgotten. 
<br>
<br>
This process is what I've referred to with my circle of friends as the "Evolution of Quicksand Tom." I would begin my replicating at the tip of my toe (bringing new meaning to the word "upload") and eventually finish with the mapping (or replacement) of my brain. Indeed the last breath of air before I would surrender my lungs for replication would be a nervous one, but when death is the alternative, and the development of quantum computation is still in its early stages, it's important to have a good backup in reserve. (But such concern might be needless if the exponential is on lift-of mode.)
<br>

&gt; "The CSV therefore lies closer to the carpet of quantum fluctuations and therefore the opportunity for it to be influenced by such quantum fluctuations is increased, but not inevitable and perhaps highly improbable, given the mathematical dynamics of this scale of physics, of which I am not a master. (A spaceship 1,000 miles above Earth may have a better probability to be influenced by Jupiter's gravity than if it was upon an Earth-based launch-pad, but is still more likely to fall back to Earth than zoom away to Jupiter, if the physical conditions of its motion limit it from doing so.)"
<br>
<br>
A spaceship, on the ground or in orbit, is not much of an "amplifier", so the analogy is not the best.
<br>
<br>
The brain, and life in general, have a characteristic ability to "amplify the small".  One might argue that the weather does as well (butterfly effect) but the difference is that the weather, and many other relatively homogeneous and unstructured systems amplify small changes chaotically, whereas living systems seem able to produce coherence out of chaotic fluctuations.
<br>
<br>
Think of how a ping-pong ball approximates a random walk, when allowed to fall between two planes where small wooden pegs form a lattice between the planes.  Drop the ball at the center of one edge, and by the time it emerges from the bottom edge, it "may" still be near the center, but might also have bounced itself farther away.
<br>
<br>
The presence of "Jupiter", tiny as it might be, is akin to a tiny adjustment in the placement of the pegs in the lattice.  Each adjustment has hardly any great individual effect upon the path of the ping-pong ball, but even the smallest effect early on is amplified as the ball continues its journey.  
<br>

&gt; "Indeed the last breath of air before I would surrender my lungs for replication would be a nervous one, but when death is the alternative ..."
<br>
<br>
Here I am confused.  Suppose the technology of upload was so "perfected", that you could be replicated right now, and this procedure was performed "non-destructively".  Now, your "upload self" feels just fine and dandy, and assures you that "it is truely you".  It goes off to live in Florida, while you move to Montana.  Are you willing to "give up your lungs/life", just because you have been perfectly uploaded?
<br>
<br>
Why should "doing it faster" (upload and death of original) make any substantive difference?
<br>
<br>
Some argue for "doing it gradually".  Even this, however, (given the preceding comments) suggests that "you" actually die every moment, and never realize it because it happens so fast, and the "new person" who inherits you memories and state each moment (thus) sees everything as "familiar".
<br>
<br>
Is this upload/immortality thing just a means to avoid "the experience of death"?  The "anticipation of death"?
<br>
<br>
While living in Montana, miles away from your perfect upload, would it be ok to kill you peacefully in your sleep, so you never knew you died?
<br>
<br>
Hmmmm.
<br>
<br>
