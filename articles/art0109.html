<p class="Reference">&#160;Though <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will be powerful (and could even be directed to expand their own toolkits by assembling new tools), they will not be able to build everything that could exist. For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however. (In fact, the reversibility of the laws governing molecular motion implies that all <i>de</i>structable objects are, in principle, <i>con</i>structable; but if the destruction mechanisms all involve an explosive collapse, then attempts at construction via the reverse mechanism may have a negligible chance of success, owing to considerations involving the uncertainty of the trajectories of the incoming parts and the low <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> of the target state.)</p>

Assume that one nanocomputer is allotted to regulate each of the quadrillion or so "<a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s" in the model <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and that each also regulates corresponding sections of "axon" and "dendrite." Since the volume of each nanocomputer (if equivalent to a modern <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>) will be about 0.0003 cubic micron (See "Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>ry and Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a>s," referenced in Chapter 1), these <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will occupy a total of about 0.3 cubic centimeter.

(This sets no limit to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, since several processors could share a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>.) This amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> seems <i>far</i> more than enough to provide an adequate model of the functional state of a <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>.

<p class="Reference">&#160;Of the nanoelectronic <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, wires will occupy the most volume. Typical dendrites are over a micron in diameter, and serve primarily as conductors. The diameter of thin wires could be less than a hundredth of a micron, determined by the thickness of the insulation required to limit <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a> (about three nanometers at most). Their conductivity can easily exceed that of a dendrite. Since the volume of the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is about equal to that of a ten-centimeter box, wires a hundred times thinner (one ten-thousandth the cross section) will occupy at most 0.01 of a cubic centimeter (allowing for their being shorter as well). Electromechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es modulated by molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry can apparently be scaled down by about the same factor, compared to <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s. &#160;</p>

<p class="Reference">&#160;<b>... dissipating a millionfold more heat ...</b> This may be a pessimistic assumption, however. For example, consider axons and dendrites as electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s transmitting signals. All else being equal, millionfold faster operation requires millionfold greater currents to reach a given voltage threshold. Resistive heating varies as the current squared, divided by the conductivity. But copper has about <i>forty</i> million times the conductivity of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s (see "A Theoretical Analysis of Electrical Properties of Spines," referenced above), reducing resistive heating to less than the level assumed (even in a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> like that described in the text, which is somewhat more compact than a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>).

(There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to believe that mechanical relays will make the best <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es, but their performance is easy to calculate.)

There exists a regular, three-dimensional woven pattern (with fibers running in seven different directions to support all possible types of load, including shear) in which packed cylindrical fibers fill about 45 percent of the total volume.</p>
<a name="r111"></a>
<p class="Reference">In any given direction, only some of the fibers can bear a substantial load, and using hollow, telescoping fibers (and then extending them by a factor of two in length) makes the weave less dense. These factors consume most of the margin between 45 percent and one percent, leaving the material only as strong as a typical steel.</p>

<p class="Reference">&#160;For the suit to change shape while holding a constant internal volume at a constant pressure, and do so efficiently, the mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> absorbed by stretching material in one place must be recovered and used to do mechanical work in contracting material in another place - say, on the other side of a bending elbow joint.</p>

<p class="Reference">&#160;A design exercise (with applications not limited to hypothetical <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> suits) resulted in a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> about 50 nanometers in diameter that works on the principle of a "pelletron"-style Van de Graaff generator, using <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a> across small gaps to charge pellets and using a rotor in place of a pellet chain. (The <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> also resembles a bucket-style water wheel.) DC operation would be at 10 volts, and the efficiency of power conversion (both to and from mechanical power) seems likely to prove excellent, limited chiefly by frictional losses. The power-conversion density (for a rotor rim speed of one meter per second and pellets charged by a single <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>) is about three trillion watts per cubic meter. This seems more than adequate.</p>

<p class="Reference">&#160;As for frictional losses in general, rotary bearings with strengths of over 6 nano-newtons can be made from <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> bonds - see <i>Strong Solids</i>, by A. Kelly (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973) - and bearings using a pair of triple-bonded <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms should allow almost perfectly unhindered rotation. Roller bearings based on atomically perfect hollow cylinders with bumps rolling gear-fashion on atomically perfect races have at least two significant <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>-dissipation modes, one resulting from phonon (sound) radiation through the slight bumpiness of the rolling motion, the other resulting from scattering of existing phonons by the moving contact point. Estimates of both forms of friction (for rollers at least a few nanometers in diameter moving at modest speeds) suggest that they will dissipate very little power, by conventional standards.</p>

<b>... the suit will keep you comfortable ...</b> Disassemblers, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, power, and cooling - together, these suffice to recycle all the materials a person needs and to maintain a comfortable environment. Power and cooling are crucial.</p>
<a name="r119"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;As for power, a typical person consumes less than 100 watts, on the average; the solar power falling on a surface the size of a sheet of typing paper (at <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s distance from the Sun) is almost as great. If the suit is covered with a film that acts as a high-efficiency solar <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, the sunlight striking it should provide enough power. Where this is inadequate, a solar-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> parasol could be used to gather more power.</p>
<a name="r120"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;As for cooling, all power absorbed must eventually be disposed of as waste heat - in a <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, by means of thermal radiation. At body temperature, a surface can radiate over 500 watts per square meter. With efficient solar cells and suitable design (and keeping in mind the possibility of cooling fins and refrigeration cycles), cooling should be no problem in a wide range of environments. The suit's material can, of course, contain channels for the flow of coolant to keep the wearer's skin at a preferred temperature.</p>

In the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> debate, for example, gas, coal, nuclear, and solar power all have their advocates. Yet multisided issues contain many two-sided questions: Is the probability of a reactor meltdown low or high? Are the effects of coal burning on acid rain small or large?

<p class="Reference">&#160;Judicious scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will seldom argue for high or low numbers as such; they will argue for the particular numbers they think most likely, or simply state evidence.

<b>... bring abundance and long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to all who wish them ...</b> But the limits to <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> ensure that universal, unconditional abundance cannot last indefinitely. This raises questions regarding the distribution and ownership of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> resources. Three <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> approaches might be considered:</p>
<a name="r283"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;One is a first-come, first-served approach, like the claiming of homesteads or mining sites through use. This has roots in the Lockean principle that ownership may be established by mixing one's labor with a previously unowned resource. But this might allow a person with a suitable replicator to turn it loose in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> to rework - and thus claim - every unclaimed object in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, as fast as it could be reached. This winner-take-all approach has little moral justification, and would have unpleasant consequences.</p>
<a name="r284"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;A second extreme would be to distribute ownership of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> resources equally among all people, and to keep redistributing them to maintain equality. This, too, would have unpleasant consequences. In the absence of universal, stringent, compulsory limitations on childbearing, some groups would continue to grow exponentially; <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary principles virtually guarantee this. In a surprisingly short <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the result of endless redistribution would be to drag the standard of living of <i>every</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being down to the minimum level that allows <i>any</i> group to reproduce. This would mean hunger and poverty more extreme and universal than that of any Third World country. If 99 percent of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race voluntarily limited its birth rate, this would merely allow the remaining one percent to expand until it absorbed almost all the resources.</p>
<a name="r285"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;A third <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> approach (which has many variations) takes a middle path: it involves distributing ownership of the resources of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> (genuine, permanent, transferable ownership) equally among all people - but doing so only once, then letting people provide for their progeny (or others') from their own vast share of the wealth of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. This will allow different groups to pursue different <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s, and it will reward the frugal rather than the profligate. It can provide the foundation for a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of unlimited <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> for the indefinite <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, if active shields are used to protect people from aggression and theft. No one has yet voiced a plausible alternative.</p>
<a name="r286"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;From a socialist perspective, this approach means equal riches for all. From a libertarian perspective, it violates no one's property rights and provides a basis for a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of liberty. In Thomas Schelling's terms, equal division is a focal point solution in a coordination game (see <i>The Strategy of Conflict</i>, by Thomas Schelling, Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1960). What "equal division" actually means is a messy question best left to lawyers.</p>
<a name="r287"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;For this approach to work, agreement will be needed not just on a principle of division, but on a date. <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> has been declared by treaty to be "the common heritage of all mankind," and we need to choose an Inheritance Day. Schelling's analysis suggests the importance, in a coordination game, of finding a <i>specific</i>, plausible proposal and of making it visible as soon as possible. Does a date suggest itself? A round-numbered <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>-related anniversary would seem appropriate, if it were not tied exclusively to the U.S. or U.S.S.R., or too soon, or too near a millennial date on the calendar. These constraints can be met; the most plausible candidate is perhaps April 12, 2011: the thirtieth anniversary of the flight of the world's first reusable spacecraft, the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttle, and the fiftieth anniversary of the flight of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, Yuri Gagarin.</p>
<a name="r288"></a>
<p class="Reference">&#160;If, before this date, someone finds and employs a means to raise <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> reproduction rates by a factor of ten or more, then Inheritance Day should immediately be made retroactive to April 12 of the preceding year, and the paperwork sorted out later.</p>
