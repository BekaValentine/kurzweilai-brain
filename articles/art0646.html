<p>Otis Port: Welcome, we're here to examine the implications of a 
              controversial new book, <i>A New Kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> by Stephen 
              Wolfram. We believe the complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s have complex causes and 
              therefore the way to comprehend such a complex thing is to carve 
              it up into little pieces and study each one of those <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly 
              until we understand the piece well enough to express it as a mathematical 
              formula. Stephen says not so. Complex systems don't have complex 
              causes. In fact, they have very simple mathematical type <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s 
              at their roots. And we can simulate, emulate <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>'s algorithms 
              with something called cellular automatons or <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>, 
              CA for short. He believes that eventually it will explain everything, 
              literally everything from what happened; how the cosmos evolved 
              since the Big Bang 15 billion years ago to the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of all 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. He hasn't yet found the mother 
              of all CA's that one master cellular automaton that would explain 
              everything that has happened since the Big Bang, but he's certain 
              that it exists, and he's hopeful that he'll find it and he's certain 
              that it will be astonishingly simple when he does. </p>
<p> Joining us also is <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>. He's a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, author, and CEO of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_technologies_entry.html">Kurzweil Technologies</a> and a couple 
              of other related companies. The thread running through most of Ray's 
              work is <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> or AI. Computer Automata are a common, 
              have been a common tool for AI <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers since the 1970s so when 
              Stephen's book came out we asked him grab it and critique it 
              for us. And there's a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613225017/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0464.html" target="_top">full 
              version of his critique</a> on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p> Basically, Ray was fascinated by most of Stephen's work and 
              impressed with its breadth, but he quibbles that computer automata 
              can really evolve into the complex systems that Stephen believes 
              they can.</p>
<p>My name is Otis <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">Port</a>. I write about <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and AI has been 
              something that has intrigued me for ages. Gentlemen, thank you both 
              for being here, Stephen, maybe a place to start would be the one 
              cellular automata that gets a lot of attention in the book, either 
              30 or 110, and something like that and why it's special.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram: I got interested a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> ago twenty years 
              ago, now, in the question of what the right primitives to understand 
              the natural world should be. There's been a tradition for three 
              hundred or so years of using mathematical equations, the kind of 
              constructs of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> as the appropriate primitives to 
              describe the natural worlds, but with computers one has a way of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about those things in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. I got interested 
              in the question of what would happen if one would allow programs 
              that generalize things like mathematics. So, I was interested in 
              the question of well, what does simple programs typically do. Well, 
              our usual <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, my intuition was if the program is sufficiently 
              simple, then what it does must be correspondingly simple. That's 
              the intuition we get from for example our usual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. If we want to make something complicated we expect 
              that we have to go to a lot of effort and make very complicated 
              rules and <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> things up in a very complicated way to achieve complicated 
              results, but I decided to do a very systematic computer <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> 
              and try all the possible simple programs of a particular kind. When 
              I went through and looked at these programs, they can be <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>ed 
              in some straightforward way. When I got to rule number 30 I saw 
              this amazing thing. I had made a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> on a computer display, 
              actually it was a printout at the time. One started out from just 
              one black <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> at the top followed this very, very simple rule and 
              when one traced it along, the pattern that it made was incredibly 
              complicated and this to me was very amazing. At first I assumed 
              that the fact that it looked complicated must be a feature of sort 
              of inadequacies of my visual system that really there was regularity 
              but I just couldn't see it. So, I tried all sorts of elaborate 
              mathematical and statistical tests and so far as any of them could 
              tell this thing was complicated. Well, that observation kind of 
              ended up changing my whole view of many of the foundations of science. 
              It's something that took me years to come to terms with.</p>
<p> What it revealed was this point that basically if you pick that 
              even with very simple programs and even very simple underlying rules, 
              it's possible to get very complicated behavior. Once one's 
              found something like this it seems very obvious seems like how could 
              this not have been found a zillion years ago. How could I not have 
              found it several years earlier than I did? Now, having discovered 
              that very simple rules can do complicated and interesting things 
              you can go back and look historically was this seen before. The 
              answer is absolutely yes. If you go back to ancient Greek times 
              for example and look at the Pythagoreans talking about prime's 
              for example, prime numbers. There's a fairly simple rule for 
              generating prime numbers. Yet, once generated the primes make a 
              kind of complicated and hard to predict sequence. That's really 
              an example of the same kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> I ended up finding in 
              rule 30 and so on and the emphasis for example in studying primes 
              was to find regularities in the distribution of primes not focusing 
              on this phenomenon of even though the rules for primes are simple 
              the actual form of primes can be complicated. If that point had 
              been recognized in antiquity, then my guess is that a lot of kind 
              of the direction of how science has developed would have been somewhat 
              different. People would not have been as mystified as how can nature 
              be as complicated as it is. I'm not sure if Ray agrees with 
              this. But perhaps we should find out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ray Kurzweil: First of all, I don't doubt the possibility 
              that we could explain the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> as a cellular automata. 
              The question is how far does the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a cellular automata 
              get us? I did, by the way find the book quite delightful and I got 
              a lot of insights in reading it. There are a couple of issues. One 
              is, you describe how a simple cellular automata, rule 30 can create 
              designs that are incredibly complicated and it is pretty amazing. 
              You really would think that starting with one cell you would get 
              something really simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Let's tell people who don't know how a cellular automata 
              evolves how it does it. The fact that you start with&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: A cellular automata, there's different ways of doing it. 
              The simplest one is you have one cell and then the next layer of 
              cells will be dependent on that cell and adjacent cells. And it 
              is pretty remarkable to look at them and you have an assemblage 
              of features even some nesting of features. Triangles are different 
              sizes, and lines and streaks and it seems to have a <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of its 
              own and you think it's settling in but then something else 
              happens and it's really unpredictable, but it's more than 
              just unpredictable, because pure randomness isn't very interesting 
              either. Pure randomness becomes predictable by its lack of predictability. 
              Here there seems to be <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> but then it lapses back into disorder 
              and it's interesting, patterns and pretty amazing that all 
              of this <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> comes from very simple rules and simplest possible 
              starting position of one black cell. The question though is how 
              complicated? Are they really incredibly complicated? Are there different 
              levels of complexity? I want to come back to that. I think it's 
              probably a key issue that we should talk about and whether or not 
              for example the complexity and intelligence of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is 
              perhaps the one <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that we can point to that is as complicated 
              our intuition is that it's as complicated as anything else 
              we know about and we're trying to emulate that in our computer 
              science, and it's the whole field of Artificial Intelligence. 
              How does that compare, say to the complexity of a dust storm or 
              fluid turbulence and things like that. I think that's really 
              a key issue. </p>
<p>To start out with a lesser but also interesting issue. The issue 
              of whether or not the universe ultimately cellular, that is to say 
              fully <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and Stephen shows how you can take these 
              certain simple rules and produce different types of patterns. For 
              example the pattern on a tent olive shell which is pretty interesting 
              and satisfying and aesthetically pleasing pattern. Actually, it 
              does resolve very simply from a cellular automata. So, these simple 
              digital rules can provide certain types of patterns.</p>
<p>But it's also possible for analog phenomena to produce similar 
              phenomena and Stephen you actually provide that derivation in the 
              book. Showing how analog continuous functions also can provide the 
              same types of patterns, so if we see these types of patterns in 
              nature it does not necessarily imply the inverse conclusion that 
              it necessarily was caused by a digital cellular pattern. It could 
              have been produced by something analog, and&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Stephen, you're sure that the universe is digital?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Well, so one thing to understand when we're talking about 
              for example mollusk shells and we're talking about what makes 
              the patterns on those shells and so on, you're talking about 
              making a model that is in an a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> an approximation, an idealization 
              of the way an actual mollusk work, and we're not expecting 
              to reproduce in every precise detail sort of the whole digestive 
              process of the mollusk and so on. There is one case in natural science 
              where modeling works differently. And that's if you can actually 
              get an ultimate fundamental model for the universe, because that's 
              a case where the model is no longer an idealization, no longer an 
              approximation, if there really is an ultimate model for the universe 
              it's just this is precisely how the universe works, and at 
              that level you can very sharply ask the question is it a model that's 
              based on discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s is it a model that's based on continuous 
              kinds of numbers of the type that have been studied in <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> 
              and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RW: Let me comment on that. I think it's an intriguing notion 
              and such a model would be a great step forward and Stephen takes 
              some significant steps towards creating that type of model, in the 
              book. There's more work to be done and I understand that you're 
              continuing to work on developing a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> that would 
              take into account all the different things we know from the standard 
              model and so on.</p>
<p> Let me read you something from my book, from my first book <i>The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a></i>. I discuss the question whether 
              the ultimate nature of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is analog or digital. I point out 
              that as we delve deeper and deeper into both natural and artificial 
              processes we find that the nature of process often alternates back 
              and forth between analog and digital representations of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. 
              I noted how the phenomena of sound flips back and forth between 
              digital and analog representations. In our brain <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> is represented 
              as a digital firing of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the cochlear representing different 
              frequency bands in the air and in the wires. The music in loud speakers 
              is an analog phenomena. Representation of sound in a music compact 
              disk is digital, which is interpreted by digital <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, but the 
              digital circuits consisted of threshold <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, which are analog 
              amplifiers. As amplifiers the transistors manipulate individual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s which can be counted and therefore digital, but on a deeper 
              level an analog subject to quantum field equations, and at a yet 
              deeper level Stephen Wolfram and some other theorists have theorized 
              that digital <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> basis to the continual equations and along 
              those lines that's a question, suppose we find a computer at 
              the basis of the universe that's digital and follows these 
              rules, it would be a great accomplishment to represent everything 
              we know in a cellular automata type framework but it wouldn't 
              necessarily be the final answer. We wouldn't know that there 
              are deeper analog phenomena.</p>

<p>SW: Several things to say. First of all, these kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ions 
              of different kind of descriptions of things in analog form or digital 
              form, this is you have to remember that all these kind of descriptions 
              are always approximations. They're always idealizations. When 
              we have the digital representation of a sound on a CD for example, 
              it's the idealization of the sound it's not representing 
              how every <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> in the vibrating air works; it's some kind 
              of idealization. The thing that is different and very shocking about 
              an ultimate theory of physics, it's no longer an idealization. 
              It would be if I'm right there's a theory, there's 
              a set of rules, which just is the universe. If you say how are these 
              rules <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed, that question doesn't really make that much 
              sense because&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Our experience in physics is that we have discovered finer 
              and finer models. We have these discrete electrons. They just are. 
              But then we find there are more complex field equations underlying 
              them and they're [inaudible] and we find if <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a> is 
              correct there are actually pretty cellular sounding type mechanisms 
              underlying those field equations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: The most dramatic possibility is the universe started from 
              a simple initial condition that had some simple geometrical symmetry. 
              It might be the case that if we turn our telescope off to the west, 
              and look at the <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> of the universe in the west, it might 
              be identical to the configuration of the universe in the east. That 
              would be the most bizarre possibility if the thing started from 
              some simple initial condition and we get to see enough of the universe 
              that we can actually sort of tell the kind of progeny of one side 
              of the initial condition and the other side of the initial condition. 
              In most theories that have <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary things happening we don't 
              get to see enough of the universe to actually be able tell that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: I'm sure this is a silly question, Stephen, but if you 
              actually find that and we actually run it on a computer aren't 
              we creating another universe?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: It's not a universe. It's just an emulation of a 
              universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: But you said, didn't you say a little while ago that if 
              you found that digital <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> it would no longer be an idealization 
              it would be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: That's correct. So, if we were to run it for long enough 
              on a computer, we would be able to find out what the universe would 
              do in precise detail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: But we don't have enough time to run it. For most cellular 
              automata given the fact that all these different phenomena interacting 
              with each other, you cannot predict the final outcome without literally 
              simulating every step and since we don't have computers that 
              run faster than the universe itself at it's finest level of 
              granularity we couldn't really run a model of the universe. 
              We could run the early part and have some idea of how it started, 
              but it would never catch up to us because it can only run as fast 
              as the universe runs or slower, generally speaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I want to come back to the question of sort of the intuition 
              that one has based on the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of physics, and how that relates 
              to what one might now believe is true. It's certainly the case 
              that if one looks at the history of physics, that every time one 
              gets to a greater level of smallness and analysis of the physical 
              world, things have gotten more complicated, there's another 
              layer and so on.</p>
<p> One of the things that in a sense has been the case is the kind 
              of the primitives that have been used in understanding those layers 
              are typically mathematical primitives and I think they've been 
              somewhat constrained by people's interest in having primitives 
              where one can kind of foresee what the outcome of doing particular 
              things with those primitives will be. I think one of those things 
              that has come out from this sort of experimental work I've 
              done on what simple computer programs do is that with more general 
              kinds of primitives, much more surprising things can happen. One 
              can really get much greater richness from much simpler ingredients. 
              I think that's what changed my intuition about whether there 
              could really be an end to this sort of sequence from classical mechanisms, 
              quantum mechanisms, quantum field theory, string theory. Whatever 
              else. I mean, I might also say in terms of the continuous versus 
              discrete dichotomy, when things get as abstract as they have to 
              be if they really is a very simple a model for the universe, and 
              I mean, one has to realize that if one can describe a whole universe 
              in terms of rules that are very short, then it's sort of inevitable 
              that nothing that's familiar to us will be obviously visible 
              in those rules. There isn't room to fit in a three for the 
              three dimensions of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> or the mass of the electron or something 
              like that so what has to be there in these underlying rules must 
              be quite abstract and quite unfamiliar to us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: But, then we have to question is there a deeper theory. And 
              I'm not sure how you would ever prove there aren't in 
              fact some more deeper phenomena.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I think the way you would do that as a practical <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. If 
              it were the case that the simple rules that one knew reproduced 
              everything we know in our universe, if one could establish that 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able certainty then what would be the point of saying 
              there's something deeper. It would have no relevance to what 
              would actually happens in our universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Let me bring up a key issue one where I think I have a somewhat 
              different perspective than you expressed, Stephen, which has to 
              do with levels of complexity. You said that the images from a class 
              four automata were incredibly complicated and in the book there 
              are a lot of statements along the following lines &#8220;what I come 
              to believe is that many of the most obvious examples of complexity 
              in biological systems actually have very little to do with adaptation, 
              or natural selection but instead they are mainly just another consequence 
              of the very <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> phenomena that I discovered that along with any 
              kind of system, any choices of underlying rules inevitably lead 
              to behavior of great complexity and I have some issue with the concept 
              of great complexity. I think there's something missing in between 
              a CA and what it can do by itself and the kind of phenomenon in 
              the world I would consider of great complexity like human beings 
              or Chopin preludes or <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, things like that. If we run a class 
              4 automata, it has some features and they're unpredictable 
              and there's a certain amount of order, but you could run it 
              for a million or a trillion or trillion trillion iterations and 
              you still get the same kind of level, same kind of pattern of these 
              features and you don't have emerging anything comparable to 
              insects, let alone humans. So, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> we had before 
              we kind of tossed around is this a concept of intelligence, which 
              I would put forth as a phenomena that is an order of complexity 
              greater than what we see in a class 4 automata, fundamentally greater. 
              Is there such a thing as that concept and you said, well, intelligence 
              is really culturally determined, and so I went looking at various 
              definitions and indeed the vast majority of them are culturally 
              determined, but I think there is a way of defining intelligence 
              that strips away human specific characteristics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I'll be interested to hear this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: And I'll read a couple of things. Intelligence represents 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> of features that solves unexpected problems better more 
              quickly, better results than a lesser hierarchy. There's a 
              nesting of features now you get a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of nesting of features 
              in a class 4 automata, but it's a pretty simple level and it 
              never really gets to be a higher hierarchy. We have a very elaborate 
              hierarchy of features within a human being and certainly if you 
              go to a very fine level, you'll see a lot of chaotic <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> 
              and the amount of computation in a human could be the same as the 
              amount of computation in a dust storm or even in a rock at a fundamentally 
              detailed enough level, but if we look at it in the right level, 
              we see a very elaborate hierarchy, and it's not an arbitrary 
              hierarchy. Each level has actually contributes something in terms 
              of being able to solve problems and it involves the ability to create 
              models of the world. I know you have some simple examples of CA's 
              or CA like processes that create simple models, but the models that 
              we create are themselves hierarchical and can be as hierarchical 
              as even the human brain that created it. I've got definition 
              of intelligence here in <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i>, the 
              ability to use optimally limited resources, including time to achieve 
              a set of goals which may include survival, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, solving 
              problems, recognizing patterns, performing skills the faculty of 
              [inaudible] which orders perceived in a situation previously considered 
              disordered. That's a quote from R.W. Young. And then the concept 
              of order, information that fits a purpose and the measure of order 
              is how well the information fits the purpose. In an evolutionary 
              algorithm, the purpose is to solve a problem. I'm not saying 
              that this shows that the world is not a CA, but I'm perfectly 
              willing to accept that possibility, but you need something on the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> of the CA to get to these higher levels of order and in 
              my view that is precisely an evolutionary process some kind of selection. 
              Evolution is needed. Cellular automata alone doesn't get you 
              there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: One feature of us as humans and I am no exception is that we 
              would like to think that we're special. This has been something 
              that has been true throughout the history of science, human thinking 
              and so on. We'd like to think that there are ways in which 
              we are not only in detail special but in generality and abstractly 
              special. And that's something that history of science has not 
              been kind to the idea that humans are special. I mean for example 
              four hundred years ago we find out that the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> isn't at 
              the center of the universe. A hundred and fifty years ago we find 
              out there isn't anything special about the origin of our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: But there I something special about humans at least if we ask 
              the questions of how are we different from different species. We're 
              the only species that has ushered in its own evolutionary process 
              which is technology. You can find other <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s that use tools, 
              but those tools do not embody a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> that gets passed 
              on from generation to generation. With the knowledge base itself 
              expands and grows exponentially over time. We're the only species 
              that expands our own horizons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I'm not sure. We don't know with whale songs for 
              example, we don't know how exactly those are passed down. With 
              bird songs there's a certain degree of passing them down, and 
              I think that obviously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: They don't have a technology. There's a limit to 
              the whale songs' complexity because they don't have means 
              of writing it down. They don't have technology. There's 
              no indication that it's significantly evolving. Whales did 
              not go into the air. They didn't go off the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. They're 
              not extending their life spans. They don't have video cameras; 
              they don't publish books on cellular automata. They don't 
              debate issues about whether or not they're special.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: We don't know that. I think that this issue, you mention 
              lots of details and one can argue to us they're very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant. 
              The way <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> works, the way technology works, these are 
              things that are very important to our specific lives, but&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: It's specifically an evolutionary process. Our combination 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, cognitive function and our ability to manipulate 
              the environment through our opposable thumb has allowed an evolutionary 
              process to continue in the guise of our technology and it evolves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: One of the things as we get to things like the opposable thumb, 
              the opposable thumb is surely a detail. We can't hang our theory 
              of intelligence on the opposable thumb. That would be a very peculiar 
              circumstance if the intelligence and the consequences of intelligence 
              were critically dependant on the opposable thumb.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: I think our technology is dependant on ability to take models 
              and I don't doubt that even birds can model their environment 
              to a certain extent and clearly giant squids are very intelligent. 
              Whales. And they clearly have some model of their environment but 
              the opposable thumb allowed us to take our models and build them 
              and then continue to improve them exponentially to the point where 
              they're actually expanding our own horizons. We've more 
              than doubled our life span in the last hundred and fifty years. 
              We went off the planet. We're going to reverse engineer our 
              own brains and understand how they work and build non-biological 
              analogs and none of that could happen unless we had the ability 
              to take those models in our brains and build them in the real world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I think one of the issues is what is the abstract essence. 
              We know that there are certain details of human intelligence, some 
              of the things you've mentioned that are significant to us quite 
              special as details. The question is there's this abstract version 
              of intelligence where we can say that something like a turbulent 
              fluid doesn't have. We know it doesn't have the details 
              of human intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: It doesn't have the hierarchy. There's a little bit 
              of hierarchy in that you have atoms and molecules and there may 
              be little eddies and so on that are features but it's limited. 
              It does not have the level of complexity, the order of hierarchy 
              that we see in a complex system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I'm being unfair, but in turbulent fluids are a bad example 
              for not having hierarchy because they have this Kolmogorov cascade 
              and eddy sizes and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: I'm not saying no hierarchy. I'm saying they don't 
              have as elaborate a hierarchy as.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: The issue is, what I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> when I was working on my book, 
              what I thought when, I was quite sure because I'm as egoistical 
              as the rest of us but there was something very special about humans 
              and about our intelligence and the kinds of things that I was studying 
              that were relevant to physical science and natural science and so 
              on would not reach that. That was the prejudice that I had going 
              into what I did. As I investigated more and more I became less and 
              less convinced of that prejudice until I got to the point where 
              I just don't believe it at all. And that there were several 
              steps that got me to that point, but maybe you wanted a more&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: I agree and I disagree. I disagree that there isn't something 
              special, but I think that the specialness is a very abstract one, 
              specifically that we expand our horizons and other species don't. 
              We're kind of the vanguard of evolution in that sense, but 
              I agree that there have been failed attempts to define our specialness 
              some as simple as the fact that all the stars are obviously going 
              around the earth and a lot of different conceptions that failed 
              to hold water, but you seem to take that to the extreme of saying 
              there is no such thing as intelligence, different orders of complexity. 
              The doctrine of computational equivalence basically says that the 
              kind of computation we see in the brain is equivalent to that in 
              a dust storm or fluid turbulence and at a certain level I agree. 
              They are both computational processes, they can both run on any 
              kind of universal computational medium. Computation is simple and 
              ubiquitous, and I agree with all that and intelligence is extremely 
              powerful concept and it emerges from evolution and the exact form 
              of any form of intelligence is very arbitrary. Human beings are 
              the way we manifest our intelligence is through an extraordinary 
              accident of our vine of evolution and any intelligence that may 
              evolve would go through some intricate and fairly arbitrary chain 
              and would end up being culturally determined within it's own 
              culture and none the less you can strip away the culture and it 
              does have a necessary hierarchy of intricate features that can solve 
              problems and perform tasks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I would have loved to conclude the kind of things that you're 
              saying. I would have liked to find sort of the essence of intelligence. 
              The thing that what makes us different from these other things that 
              I believe have extensive computational abilities. I have not managed 
              to find that. Now, if somebody can produce it I will become a very 
              happy person, but I have not managed to find it. So the question 
              is does the weather have a mind of its own. And that's where 
              you would say it does not and I would say it's very hard to 
              pin down what you mean by that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Ray brought up; he mentioned your theory of computational equivalence 
              a little bit ago. Help me out a little bit. How can you be sure 
              that well, first of all, you postulate right that once complexity 
              reaches a certain level it doesn't get any more complex? How 
              do you know that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: In science, most of the time, one gets to make inferences based 
              on ones observations and so on, so the principle of computational 
              equivalence is something that's a merged from lots of experiments 
              and analysis that I've tried to do. Inevitably in science it's 
              a leap beyond what I can know from my experiments and my observations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Have you actually tried to make something more complex and 
              couldn't?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: No. That's not the way this tends to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: The idea of the principle of computational equivalence is essentially 
              any system where its behavior is not sort of obviously simple and 
              regular will tend to correspond to a computation that is at the 
              same level. Now, it's not clear that there might not be things 
              that are a higher level for example people as a theoretical matter 
              even when <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> first wrote about universal computers and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">turing machine</a>s and so on, he said well, what if you had something 
              that was beyond a turing machine that was a turing machine plus 
              what he called an oracle which is a black box that answers questions 
              a turing machine can't answer. Then at least, in principle 
              we would have something that was beyond a turing machine that was 
              able to do more computation than a turing machine and cellular automaton, 
              and any of the other kinds of programs I looked at. Then it's 
              a non-trivial statement to say no, those kinds of oracle black boxes 
              while in principle we can talk about them don't actually exist 
              in our universe. You can't actually make one of those in our 
              universe. Actually, let's me say another thing though. It's 
              when we're talking before you were observing that one of the 
              challenges that you've often faced is people saying AI isn't 
              possible, the brain, what humans do is just something beyond what 
              we could ever achieve with technology, with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and so on. 
              And I think that to many people perhaps, still there's some 
              doubt, can machines replicate all of the fine intuition, <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, whatever other properties of the brain they think they're 
              particularly concentrating on. I think you and I agree, and probably 
              disagree with a great many other people that really it will be possible 
              to replicate all of the features of a brain in a piece of solid 
              state <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s or something.</p>
<p> Now, in a sense, what I'm saying and the conclusions I have 
              come to and are embodied in these principles of computational equivalence 
              and the things I said in the book are even more extreme than that. 
              Saying not only can we replicate what goes on is there a replication 
              of what goes on in the brain that could be achieved by solid state 
              electronics but that sort of this is the kinds of things that go 
              on in the brain are naturally reproduced by&#8230; there's no 
              essence of what goes on in the brain, that isn't already something 
              that happens in lots of these natural systems that show behavior 
              that seems as complex.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Clearly there's a hierarchy of features in the brain. 
              It's able to create models of itself and of the real world. 
              Those models have hierarchies like language has a lot of intricate 
              features in it and language is a product of the brain, how do you 
              get from rule 110 to human brain and I'm not saying you can't 
              get there, but there's only two ways. One is through some evolutionary 
              process, and if you follow that elaborate evolutionary process, 
              you'll get to something culture determines is very different 
              than the brains. Or, you can reverse engineer some entity that's 
              already gone through the process, which is the AI model that I've 
              used which is still derivative of that evolutionary process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: One thing that I think is in a sense ironic. I'm sure 
              you run into many people who say you know how can you possibly make 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> AI? How can you possibly reproduce all those details 
              of the brain and so on and so on and so on? What I would say in 
              response to that is you'll be arguing about that until it really 
              exists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: That's right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: There's no way to abstractly say whether we can do it 
              or not, and I'm going to have to say the same thing to you 
              about the extent to which one can produce something that has all 
              the features of our intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Without going through an evolutionary process and without copying&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Let's take a couple of thought experiments that I think 
              are perhaps interesting. One thing I think a useful collection of 
              thought experiments come from trying to think about <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> 
              intelligence because extraterrestrial intelligence is another intelligence 
              that doesn't share the historical details of our intelligence 
              so the question is how would we tell whether we're seeing an 
              example of extraterrestrial intelligence. It's interesting 
              to look at the history of what's happened in attempts to identify 
              extraterrestrial intelligence. I think it's sort of constructive. 
              For example, famous example, in the early days of radio, Marconi 
              had a yacht that he used to fly the Atlantic on, I believe, and 
              on his yacht he used to do experiments so he set up a radio antenna 
              on his yacht and he was just listening to what radio stuff is out 
              there in the cosmos, and he heard these funny kind of whoosh, funny 
              kind of sounds, and his immediate assumption was something as complicated 
              as that and with all the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> that that has must be the Martians 
              sending us radio signals. It turned out it was various physical 
              processes and the plasma and the ionosphere. Same kind of thing 
              happened with pulsars for example, the kind of regular pulses from 
              a pulsar, the immediate assumption was these were extraterrestrial 
              intelligence beacons. Turned out to be the details of it turned 
              out to be rotations of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neutron_entry.html">neutron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: They also turned out not to be that complex to have that many 
              features to really represent anything that interesting. It didn't 
              give, say a series of axioms in any arbitrary system in you would 
              say the Euclidian <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is very arbitrary but in any axiom system 
              and then develop theorem's from it or some kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> 
              that we would recognize as intelligence and we dismissed it because 
              it didn't have those that kind of level of complexity and it 
              had a little bit of complexity because I think that natural systems 
              like wind storms in the cosmos have a certain amount of order because 
              they have also evolved to a certain level, but not to the level 
              of human brains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: So, let me ask you this then. We see a signal from the cosmos. 
              How do we know if it corresponds to an&#8212;If it was produced by 
              intelligence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: It could perhaps tell some stories about how planets are organized 
              and go around the star and how satellites go around the planets 
              and sort of represent that in using some sort of language, per se 
              or some <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ism. I think mathematics is an example that's 
              used the most and I know you said a simple process could generate 
              axioms and theorems. I'm not sure that's true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: The one feature of mathematics I, <a class="thought" href="entries/epistemology_entry.html">epistemology</a> does not necessarily 
              the thing I was expecting we'd be covering here, but let's to one 
              issue about mathematics is to what extent is mathematics as we know 
              it a cultural <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a> and to what extent is it a necessary feature 
              of abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> so to speak and I have come to a conclusion, 
              again, a conclusion that surprised me that mathematics as it is 
              actually practiced is a really very much a cultural artifact. It's 
              a long chain of historical development, which starts in ancient 
              Babylon where arithmetic was used for commerce, geometry was used 
              for land surveying and these things were progressively generalized 
              over the course of Mathematical....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Numbers are pretty fundamental. I don't know that they're 
              that culturally determined and so axioms and interesting theorems 
              about number theory if you suddenly saw that coded in some fashion 
              that would be a pretty convincing demonstration of intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: See, number theory is a good example because what was very 
              exciting to the Pythagoreans was perfect numbers and so on has not 
              been that interesting to most of the history of mathematics. It's 
              tremendously hard to kind of see outside of the cultural box so 
              to speak which one is and&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: So how about simply a coding of prime numbers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: It's a fairly simple process that generates primes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: But we've never seen that in the natural world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Yes we have. For example if you look at the rings of Saturn 
              for example at the divisions in the rings of Saturn, the form of 
              those divisions depends on the relative primality of <a class="thought" href="entries/integer_entry.html">integer</a>s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: It's just a few primes. If you actually counted the first 
              thousand primes it would be pretty impressive for a natural process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: How many primes would you like it to count? I think probably 
              about ten you can tell in the rings of Saturn. Whether there's 
              some other case in <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">astronomy</a> where you can see a hundred I'm 
              not sure. I'd have to think about it for a bit to see where 
              one might see this. Again, that's a thin thread on which to 
              hang&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: You'd be impressed if you had a signal that just counted 
              primes or counted or just told a very nice elegant story of an axiom 
              and theorem system, we'd be hard pressed to discount that as 
              a natural process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: One of the points you made in your review that caught my eye 
              was that Stephen's cellular automata don't seem to have 
              any competition any tension between them so there's no win 
              or lose type decision at various points.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: One of the things that had also surprised me. I had thought 
              that the kinds of studies I was making of simple programs and so 
              on would be kind of relevant to physics, and perhaps to some kinds 
              of and to other kinds of things like that but in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> there would 
              be a higher level of complexity, a higher level of processes going 
              no that would be associated with the whole Darwinian idea of adaptation 
              and natural selection and so on and so I was very surprised at an 
              empirical level it seems to me that I was never able to find those 
              things that sort of were higher level because there were <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              where selection being applied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: But you denied the reality of intelligence and kind of dismiss 
              it because it's hard to define and because there's controversy 
              about its definition and a lot of the definitions are culturally 
              determined, which I'm not so sure is a bad thing. Evolution 
              has accomplished something, and the difficulty in defining it and 
              a hierarchy in features is where not an arbitrary hierarchy as you 
              have in rivers and estuaries on just a planet, but a purposeful 
              hierarchy where each level has been put in there through the mill 
              of the conflict of evolution that has finely honed in an arbitrary 
              but nevertheless purposeful fashion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Now you're bringing in another word, that is a very slippery 
              word, and that is the word purpose. The question is what has a purpose 
              and how would we tell. For example one thought experiment that I 
              think is kind of interesting is again sort of an extraterrestrial 
              intelligence thought experiment which is we look at the configuration 
              of stars in the sky and we imagine a very advanced civilization 
              that's capable of moving stars around. The question is what 
              would they do to move the stars for a purposeful purpose, so to 
              speak? Would they make simple geometrical shapes? Turns out that 
              there are gravitational processes that will make perfect triangles 
              and so on. Would they make some more complicated kind of random 
              shapes, maybe the kind of shapes that the Babylonians identified 
              as constellations and we actually see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Yes, but triangles we see in the cellular automata and that 
              but I the one hand and it really gets to the heart how far CA takes 
              us. I was struck with the <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a> in both order and randomness of 
              the output of these class 4 automata. On the other hand, all the 
              pictures in the book are recognizable as a certain level of what 
              I would call complexity. And in your doctrine of equivalence, all 
              these different levels of order, different levels of complexity, 
              are rendered equivalent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: When you said all these different levels you are actually really 
              only identified two. You identified human intelligence and other 
              stuff. Is there yet other levels or are we talking about?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: I think there's a continuum; I mean you can take&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: What's an example of something, which is&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: In between? Say, current state of AI is in between. It can 
              perform functions that used to require human intelligence but it 
              doesn't yet have the suppleness and subtlety and range and 
              ability to deal with language of human beings. It's somewhere 
              in between. Many of our examples of technology are in between and 
              other animals, say, apes, you mentioned whales. We've identified 
              other species that seem to have some level of intelligence. There's 
              a sense that a whale, a squid maybe at our level, maybe below. Dogs 
              and cats we consider to be somewhat intelligent, more intelligent 
              than an insect, which may be more intelligent than a single cell 
              creature. So, we do have a sense of a continuum of intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I think this question of what has a purpose and how can we 
              tell whether a thing has a purpose, when you're presented with 
              a thing how do you tell whether that thing was made for a purpose 
              or not? Well, one way that one can guess is if the thing achieves 
              some particular function, performs some particular function, there's 
              a question of whether it performs that function in some minimal 
              way or whether it performs that function in some elaborate sort 
              of ornamental kind of way and I think that this is a way of sort 
              of potential definition of purpose is to say that a thing visibly 
              has a purpose if it achieves it's function.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: [Inaudible] a machine's intelligence, the ability to use 
              in an optimal fashion limited resources including time to achieve 
              a set of goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: What I was going to say which now somehow disagrees with that 
              while in principle one can recognize a purpose by saying the thing 
              achieves what it achieves in a minimal way, our technology is very, 
              very far away from that. And, certainly our intelligence is very 
              far away from that. If we look at a Pentium <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> or something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: That's the point of evolution. It doesn't immediately 
              go to optimal. It's continually having different things compete, 
              and the ones that are more optimal, use less resources, achieve 
              the result a little bit better or faster. survive and the other 
              ones don't and that process continues so it continues to get 
              better and better and more and more optimal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: But that's a common claim of kind of the evolutionary 
              doctrine. One of the things I've been interested in is the 
              question when we see complexity in biology, very obvious kind of 
              tangible complexity like elaborate pigmentation patterns on mollusk 
              shells, those sort of things, what can we say about what their origin 
              is. Is their origin some process of optimization? Some sort of careful 
              crafting by trying to fit into some ecological niche. Or is it just 
              various random programs were tried and many of those random programs 
              turned out to produce these complicated patterns. When I've 
              gone back and looked at some of those experiments the people have 
              done. They say, look we've got this very complicated stuff 
              going on. This is a sign that something very interesting is happening 
              in our evolutionary process. They're not right about that. 
              That this sort of, they're not seeing what they think they're 
              seeing which is the complexity they're getting is somehow carefully 
              crafted by this complicated process of evolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: There is a honing of details of a design through evolutionary 
              process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: For sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: I think there's some problems with the way we set up our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a>s and we need ways of evolving the methods 
              of evolution. We didn't stay with one <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a> and things 
              evolve at every level, but I mean, how do you get from a class 4 
              automata, to the kind of elaborate hierarchy of design that you 
              see in a human being? They don't evolve just by themselves. 
              Just running the CA by itself you will continue to get the same 
              level of complexity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: The universe doesn't evolve and yet within the universe 
              things like us come to be. If I'm right that there's a 
              simple program that represents the universe. If there is a definite 
              simple program that represents the universe. That program gives 
              everything. It gives this process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: There's one other issue I wanted to get at on the level 
              of physics, the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s presumably would be some sort 
              of glider in how we understand them in automata, and the glider 
              would embody the encoding of information to represent the properties 
              that we associate like spin and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Why is it called a glider?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: A glider because you have the cellular, the celestial computer 
              meaning the cellular automata, that is implementing these rules 
              or is the rules. And, so it comes from one state to the next and 
              the phenomenon that was discovered fairly early on Stephen's been 
              involved with CA's for a good twenty years is that you can have 
              certain aggregate pattern that actually copies itself into the next 
              state exactly but generally displaced let's say by one cell or maybe 
              diagonally by a cell and it will then move and so it glides across. 
              That kind of looks like a particle. If you have two gliders and 
              they hit each other they will interact kind of like fundamental 
              particles in an accelerator. It's suggested, anyway that you could 
              define fundamental particles as CA gliders and they embody in their 
              shape and so on a certain amount of information and Ed Fredkin has 
              said that a fundamental property is spin; it would be encoded somehow 
              in the definition of these gliders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: This is kind of a na&#239;ve level of understanding of what 
              it means for the universe to be like a computer. This is kind of 
              a we've been talking a bunch about cellular automata and I 
              haven't made the more fuss each time to say no it isn't 
              just cellular automata it's simple programs in general, but 
              this is a place where that distinction matters. A cellular automaton 
              is a very specific kind of simple program which has as you say a 
              grid or an array of cells like the arrangements of atoms in a regular 
              crystal or some such other thing. The traditional idea that's 
              existed in most of physics that space just is and then there's 
              matter and all the particles and so on that do things on top of 
              space. Part of what I think is going on and it's more abstract 
              more difficult to understand and to explain is something where space 
              is all there is and it's features of space itself that correspond 
              to things like particles and so on. The <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> is something like 
              some fluid like water, seems to be continuous, just like space seems 
              to be to us continuous in the sense that you can move from anywhere 
              to anywhere in arbitrarily small increments and so on. But in fact 
              we know that water isn't at an underlying level a continuous 
              fluid, it has a bunch of discrete molecules bouncing around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: There has to be some kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> and our conception of 
              space is an abstraction where the fundamental reality is the cellular 
              network, and it I'm not saying it can't be done but its 
              not clear how you get a network that would give you the results 
              that we've seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: That part is actually very easy. There are other parts that 
              are hard. But that part is quite easy. The thing is that it's 
              easy but it's abstract so you have this network and it has 
              these nodes and it's connected to other nodes. At first you 
              might not have any reason to think that the sort of aggregate of 
              that when you have enough nodes that what you would get would be 
              anything that even vaguely approximates ordinary space. It's 
              a slightly long story that I talk about in the book. One has a notion 
              of space. One has a notion of time based on updating these networks 
              and the remarkable thing is that with certain kinds of underlying 
              rules, not only does one get invariance with respect to rotating 
              things around in space one also gets the more subtle invariants 
              that one gets, that' associated with special [inaudible] that 
              there's it's in a sense it's not surprising that 
              there's no directionally issue because this model of space 
              doesn't have anything like a regular grid. It has a network, 
              and it's an network that has random features and it's 
              not surprising that this network with many random features that 
              they won't be any particular preferred directions that exist. 
              I might say that defining what a particle is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of this 
              idea that there's nothing in this universe except space is 
              a tricky business. Actually one person who did think seriously about 
              idea that there might be nothing in the universe except space was 
              Einstein. In the later years of his life when he tried to develop 
              what he called the <a class="thought" href="entries/unified_field_theory_entry.html">unified field theory</a> which has little to do with 
              modern unified grand unified theories and so on he had the idea 
              that the only thing that might exist in the universe is <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> 
              and gravitational fields and that somehow the particles we see might 
              be some sort of knots or singularities in the gravitational fields.</p>
<p> He tried to make that work. He couldn't make that work on 
              the basis of continuum, Einstein equations and so on that he had. 
              I think what I believe is that in a minimal model for the universe 
              which I think is always the place to start from that is going to 
              work, that there might need to be nothing in the universe except 
              space and all the features, all the particles and so on that we 
              see might end up being just features of this space. The reason that 
              I think that the underlying stuff of the universe is based on these 
              networks is sort of the network has as little as possible built 
              into it; it doesn't have a notion of space. It doesn't 
              have a notion of colors of cells and it doesn't have a notion 
              of, it has sort of the minimal set of possible notions built into 
              it. It doesn't know how many dimensions it's in. It's 
              just a bunch of connectivity information and from that there then 
              can what's interesting is there can emerge from that notions 
              like space, like time, and to my surprise, special <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> and 
              to my even greater surprise, general relativity and features of 
              gravity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Stephen, do you see this having any practical applications?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Like what.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: In fact, my more extreme, my sort of brash predication, okay 
              is that fifty years from now, of the new technology that is getting 
              produced at that time, more of it will be based, for example from 
              the kinds of ideas in my book, then is based on ideas that emerge 
              from calculus and traditional mathematical approaches to science.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: So researchers could actually take the work that's in 
              the book and use that to help them evolve new&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Yes. Absolutely. I know there are a great many different kinds 
              of researchers and technology people who are trying to use things 
              in the book to a variety of different kinds&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Like <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: That's one kind of application. There are different kinds 
              of applications. Some applications are to essentially scientific 
              questions. Taking simple programs and using those as models for 
              specific kinds of things, whether in physics, or there's a 
              particular enthusiasm for doing that in biology. It's a clear 
              issue right now what is the appropriate way to idealize the processes 
              that go on in the biological cells, to make a theoretical computational 
              biology. I think there's considerable enthusiasm which I share 
              for using the kind of simple program mechanisms that I talk about 
              in the book as the raw materials to make appropriate models for 
              processes that go on in cells. And in other kinds of technology, 
              there are questions like if you want to make a computer out of the 
              minimal possible <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, it's important to know just how 
              simple the rules can be to make the computer, and so for example 
              the systems that I look at that correspond to very simple rules 
              that turn out to be capable of universal computation. That's 
              important to know about because those things are things that you 
              might realistically be able to implement using atoms and molecules 
              and so on. That's another I think, important direction. At 
              first it might seem absurd to say we can implement everything using 
              one of these rules where you might have to build all this elaborate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to use that rule, but if that rule can be implemented at 
              the level of atoms, a few layers of software doesn't really 
              cost you that much relative to what you gain having the thing implemented 
              at the level of atoms. Another quite different type of application 
              is for artistic purposes where often <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> is inspired by what we 
              actually see in nature and what we are familiar with in nature. 
              If one can understand the essence of what produces the forms that 
              we see in nature, that kind of expands the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of what one can 
              use to do things for artistic or computer graphics and other kinds 
              of purposes like that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: I think it's important work and in my mind it's significance 
              to be most important in what it tells us abstractly on a few key 
              points. One is the simplicity of computation and it's ubiquitousness. 
              When we get into nanotechnology where the entities are going to 
              be very simple. And we're going to try to build up complex 
              results from very simple <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to help them organize themselves; 
              we want very simple models of computation. However, I don't 
              think we can achieve, say the goal in my field, which is AI, strong 
              AI, which is the ultimate goal, roughly defined as replicating the 
              full range of human intelligence, understanding and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              recreating it's basic principles, just through CA's. Starting 
              with simple conditions and jumping to the complexity you get with 
              rule 130. It's going to jump, but not to <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>. We're 
              going to need to understand what I've been calling the cascade, 
              the hierarchy of features that was the arbitrary result of billions 
              of years of evolution that produced human intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: However we get there, though, both of you earlier agreed that 
              you think machines eventually will, at least&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: And not that long from now in my mind. Within three decades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I would say that the idea that from a rule 110 evolving on 
              a computer, suddenly an intelligent, human like intelligence will 
              jump out, this will not happen. We all know this will not happen. 
              The question is we talked about the much more abstract issue of 
              whether there's an essence of intelligence that is not captured 
              by processes like the ones going on with rule 110, like the way 
              that rule 110 would sort of respond to it's environment. Is 
              there something really qualitatively and essentially different about 
              that then about the way that humans do it? That's a separate 
              issue from whether some of the kinds of ideas about simple programs 
              and what they do can be useful in the practical pursuit of AI. You 
              said that you think that there is some essence of intelligence that 
              is not specific to our brain that is some kind of abstract essence 
              of intelligence yet you seem to think that to achieve AI, the only 
              way we're going to be able to do that is by reverse engineering 
              what the actual brain that sort of historically&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Or any brain of that level of complexity that we can get our 
              hands on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: It's still a brain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: That's the only one we know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: But you see I think that in a sense&#8212;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: If we could find another one we could reverse engineer that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: In a sense that kind of betrays what's true about the 
              nature of intelligence. What you're basically saying is the 
              way that we do this thing that sort of captures intelligence is 
              to take this one example that we think we definitely have which 
              is human brains and reverse engineer that. We don't sort of 
              abstractly think about sort of hierarchies of whatever and use that 
              to kind of build up our intelligent thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: We do do that as well. Most of the history of AI has not been 
              reverse engineering of the human brain. Most of the history to date 
              has in fact been creating a different kind of intelligence that's 
              also has a certain amount of hierarchy but is a result of our engineering 
              just as our flying machines aren't emulations of birds. And, 
              both of those methods are going to continue to get us make progress.</p>

<p>OP: Two years ago of course, <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> took one look at this situation

              reaction to a conversation we had in September of 1998 at a George

              give more complex results. You can have lots of simple methods interacting

<p>SW: I'm an optimist and I also think that the idea of saying 
              lets make some rule, some law that we say you can't do this 
              big swath of poorly designed things is unlikely to have good results.</p>

<p>OP: If you're an optimist what saves humanity? Once we have 
              intelligent machines that can replicate themselves in biological, 
              our method of reproduction will seem like a snail's pace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: It's an interesting question. What will the end point 
              of the human condition will end up being. There will be a time, 
              I think and Ray agrees about this that there could be a time when 
              we could have this little cube sitting on the desk that would replicate 
              the thought processes of any of us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: Or all of us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: And the question is for example, what would these cubes sitting 
              around, what would they do? What will be, many of the things that 
              have shaped human civilization are various kinds of constraints 
              that we've tried to push beyond and these sorts of things, 
              what would these little cubes just sitting around having all the 
              resources they want, what will be what they choose to do? I don't 
              think we know, necessarily, I think it's also the case that 
              in the end it's sort of a disappointing conclusion that we

              state cubes.</p>

<p>RK: When you describe it that way it sounds like it's minimizing 
              it and whenever you talk about people becoming machines, people 
              think about the machines they've known and they don't 
              want to be a machine like that because that's going to be a 
              step backwards because these machine are very primitive. In my mind 
              it's not an alien invasion of intelligent machines coming from 
              over the horizon to replace us but it is really emerging from within 
              our civilization. We'll start out by merging with it quite 
              literally. We're now pretty close to our technology. We keep 
              it in our pocket and ultimately some of us are already putting it 
              in our brains and bodies, generally people with disabilities, medical 
              problems, but there are a whole bunch of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s that will 
              replace brain circuits and will work with biological neurons and 
              ultimately we will expand what it means to be human and ultimately 
              the non-biology, non biological portion will dominate because it's 
              growing exponentially whereas the biological <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> is relatively 
              fixed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: This is a place where we agree.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: But they've got to be doing human things and they've 
              got to be doing human things more than we do it. I'd like to 
              be more human. I'd like to be able to express myself more eloquently 
              at times, and I'd like to be able to create music at a certain 
              level. I'd like to be able to create more beautiful music. 
              I'd like to be able to do things at the peak of human ability 
              all the time and so on and these technologies will enable us to 
              be more of the positive qualities that we associate with humanity. 
              Our conflicts will also be more intense but it will amplify what 
              it means to be human.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Getting much less grandiose, you even used you even explored 
              the potentials for <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a>, what about decryption?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: You mean cryptanalysis for example?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: I never thought about this question how would what I have done 
              apply to cryptanalysis, but since you asked the question, the I 
              think that the idea of being able to enumerate all possible simple 
              programs and see what they do has some potential in cryptanalysis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: The work that you've done has this enormous breadth of 
              application from very mundane things like encryption and decryption 
              all the way up to revising our understanding of the structure of 
              the whole cosmos. If all this proves out is this going to be the 
              most important book of the decade?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: The ideas are important. The notion that simple programs and 
              what they do this is an important thing. This book happens to be 
              the encapsulation of this idea. The idea is the thing that is important 
              and will be a kind of in the history of science for example, will 
              end up being seen as one of the more important ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: Stephen very interesting. I thank you very much for coming. 
              It was enjoyable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SW: Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OP: And for helping me understand a little more about what Stephens' 
              been doing. Thanks very much, Ray.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>RK: My pleasure.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This is an exciting and inspiring discussion!
<br>
<br>
I share exactly the same belief with Wolfram that the origin of everything is astonishingly simple, and it has to be that way.
<br>
<br>
However, I have different ideas on what the belief really is.
<br>
<br>
First, about the CA model, I think the term CA may not reflect the belief precisely, I would like to use the term AW(artificial world) corresponding to the AI saying. But what matters is the idea behind no matter what that term is named. To achieve the strong AI or AGI, I believe we first need to create an AW in which the AI can be evolved into being. If we can create the right AW, the AW would evole, and what that would happens in it can be understood and described with the same rules of quantum mechanic and relative theory, there would be all kinds of fields and particles we now know by physics, life(complex adaptive system) emerges and finally AI should be achived just like what happened in our real world, in short AI must be an emergence consequence of AW.
<br>
<br>
So the RIGHT AW or CA must be albe to explain everything.
<br>
<br>
Second, about the rules (of CA or AW).
<br>
 The rules we need to choose or find out have to be simple, astonishingly and extremely simple, however, there are thousands simple rules out there, simple is just not enough, it got to be "naturally" simple. The naturally simple rules must look like there is no rule at all, in short about the rules, less makes more, simple makes complexity, and the ultimate rule we are seeking for must fit in with this saying: nothing makes everything.
<br>
<br>
Third, digital or analog? 
<br>
I believe the digital CA or AW represent our real world perfectly because of quantum mechanic, a quantum world is also a digital world, the analog or continuous world is just an idealization statistic of the quantum world, and it leads to next point.
<br>
<br>
Rule of uncertainty is the key to AGI!
<br>
The rule must be a quantum rule. So, the CURRENT CA models won't work, (actually nothing on the current Turning machine will make AGI), none of them can evolve to a real complicated world like what we live in. Quantum rule means digital(that's already done) and uncertainty, so the rule should only gives result of possibility but not certainty, I believe this is extremely important. 
<br>
<br>
Finally, Kurzweil's comment of "But we don't have enough time to run it." is true, that is a big problem of the CA or AW method to achieve AGI, I think the coming of quantum computer should help, not just it runs much more faster, most important is it runs in in a quantum way to execute the quantum rule for CA or AW.
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi teekcode!
<br>
<br>
I too am inspired by Woolfram.
<br>
<br>
but the universe as geometry is just one possible description of it, and I suspect there are many...maths for example.
<br>
Also time may not be so relevant because it's somethng that is created by prvailing conditions; in a sense it's infinite.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont share your idea that digital computers wont be able to do the maths needed, because if we get the right programs on them, they will form new systems, quantum computations if that's appropriate.
<br>
<br>
Computers coming are self-evolving and modifying..in a similar to the brain, but at vaster compexities.
<br>
<br>
i think we are just at the very edge of scsince.
<br>
<br>
there are many universes with diffrent scsinces opperating in them, but they are related, and one challenge is finding the laws that coalesce them.

<br>
<br>
Did you see this part of the interview, where S. Wolfram says:
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Part of what I think is going on and it's more abstract, more difficult to explain is something where space is all there is and it's features of space itself that correspond to things like particles and so on.  The analogy is something like some fluid like water, seems to be continuous, just like space seems to be to us continuuous . . . . </p></center>

Might CA somehow orchestrate turbulence?

<br>
<br>
Yeah, CA can do fluid, and I would guess that it could do a superfluid sub-atomic substrate with the properties required of Sorce Theory, and that given enough processing power it could simulate the Sorce model of the atom.  The fine-tuning of these equations would give us the (CA equivalent of the) unified field equations, actually.  Feynman did say something to the effect that the laws of physics might be better stated in terms of CA, I think.  Also, Bucky Fuller's Computational Cosmography, a synergetic-geometry based physical CA, might be a good route, though it may be better at simulating a gel than a fluid.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>CA- especially quantum CA running on 2 in/ 2 out quantum logic gates are very promising prospects for finding the algorithmic structure of the dynamics of the Universe- 
<br>
<br>
Ray's concern is that a single CA might not be able to provide the seemingly unlimited hierarchical fractal complexity of the world- I don't necissarily agree with that per se- [CAs should in principle be able provide any amount of complexity- any kind of dynamic system]
<br>
<br>
however my take on this is that the idea of a SINGLE cellular automata is probably incorrect- the substrate for an CA is described as a logic gate network- and any such network can run MANY CAs- but to suggest that the Universe arises from a particular singular CA requires that the substtrate ptoviding the function of a logic network is somehow programmed to run only this one CA- given the Simulation Argument I suppose this could be- but considering a natural perspective and looking at how nature seems to operate on all scales: as an evolutionary system with processes and forms competing/cooperating in noncompromise and kludged adaptations and selection- it seems more sensible to me that the universe is an emregent process out of an ECOLOGY of many different quantum CA randomly running through the logic network- 
<br>
<br>
this concept: an ecology of CAs instead of a single CA- would also satisfy Ray's concern over complexity- we all know how evolutionary ecologies can produce complexity-
<br>
<br>
but it would spell doom for the physicist's dream of a single and simple Theory of Everything- as Chris Langton once said- the future of physics is going to look mtre like biology

NKS has become my basic instructions before leaving earth.  Why didn't we have these insights decades ago?

I see it everywhere nowadays.

Just last April I noticed that a simple algorithm: E x R = T (earnings times rate equals tax) became the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations.
<br>
<br>
And a sugar molecule(complex as it is but not was) became cotton candy(the current knot theory has gotta be working here!)
<br>
<br>
I still look forward to my coffee while surfing 12 hours a day and I eat a bit more of NKS as the days roll on.  This body of mine is more simple than complex and I'd really like to move on to pure energy rushing around the net. As the telomeres shorten, I am increasingly passionately addicted to knowledge...ancient...current....unknown....delici  ous knowledge.

I am so happy to live in the generation of Wolfram and Kurzweil even if I am stuck understanding them intuitively rather than being able to dissect their visions.</p></td>
