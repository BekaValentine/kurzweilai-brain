<br>
<p>An entire <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be constructed from the repetition of a very simple <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> called a <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>. We can make an even stronger statement: any <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be built with just one type of <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>. Any <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (serial computers, which do one <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> at a time, as well as massively parallel computers, which do many things at once) can in theory be built from a suitable <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of this very simple <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> states that all problems solvable by a "<a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> being" (a person) are reducible to a set of algorithms. Another way of expressing this thesis is that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are essentially equivalent. According to this (controversial) thesis, human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> may at present be (quantitatively) more complex than <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>-that is, use more parallelism and more sophisticated algorithms-but there is no fundamental (qualitative) difference between them. As machines gain in <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, do more operations in parallel, and use more capable methods (better algorithms), they will be able to emulate human intellectual ability more and more closely. This article will demonstrate that the <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>, particularly the one we call NOR, can be considered the basis of all <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. To the extent that one accepts the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>, the simple <a class="thought" href="entries/nor_gate_entry.html">NOR gate</a> can be considered (at least in theory) the basis of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> as well. Our ability to model the complex and diverse examples of intelligent behavior from building blocks of NOR gates is another example of a simple unifying formula underlying complicated phenomena. As the following derivation points out, however, this insight alone is not sufficient to build an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>To understand how we can build a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> from logic gates, it is first necessary to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of such devices.<br>

<span class="Caption">A <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>.</span>
<br> A <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> with two inputs and one output. We can imagine each input and the output to be wires. Each wire can have two states: true and false. When implemented with electronics, this often corresponds to the presence or absence of electric voltage. For example, in TTL (<a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> logic) circuits, a very common type, +5 volts and 0 volts represent the two states.</p>
<p>With two inputs and two possibilities for each input, there are four possible input combinations to a <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>. There are actually several types of logic gates. Particular types will associate each of these four combinations of input with an output. For example, the NOR ("not or") <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a> transforms each of these four possible input combinations as shown in the table.</p>

<td>It turns out that there is one other logic function that can also be used to build all the logic functions, the NAND gate. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this is as follows. A critically important logic function is negation or the NOT function. Only four of the 16 logic functions allow us to negate an input: NOR, NAND, NOT <i>A</i>, and NOT <i>B</i>. Of these four, two, NOT <i>A</i> and NOT <i>B</i>, are unable to give us AND or OR because they each ignore one of their inputs. Thus, only NOR and NAND can give us all three vital building blocks of NOT, AND, and OR.</td>

</table><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a></h1><p>Thus, all of logic can be built up from one simple <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>, NOR (or alternatively, NAND). There is, however, one other important type of mechanism essential for either <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> or human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the ability to remember. In the same way that we can build up very complex logic functions from very simple ones, we can also build very complex and extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> structures from simple one-bit (on or off) <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. The question, then, is, Can we build a one-bit <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> from logic gates? As it turns out, we can.</p>
<p>If the "set" input (which might be called MAKE TRUE) is made true, even momentarily, the output will become true and will remain true, even when the set input becomes false. This <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cell, constructed of only two NOR gates, thus remembers forever even a temporary state of true on the set input. Similarly, a momentary state of true on the "reset" (MAKE FALSE) input will cause the output to go <br>

<span class="Caption">A <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cell from NOR.</span>
<br>permanently to false. Interestingly, we can replace the two NOR gates with NAND gates in exactly the same <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cell will work in a similar way (we need only reverse the position of the "<a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>" and "not <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>" output lines and negate the set and reset input lines).</p>
<p>We thus have all logic functions as well as <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>-the two requirements for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>-built up from a very simple <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nor_gate_entry.html">NOR gate</a> (or NAND gate). With enough NOR gates we can build any <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> any <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>. All <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (and, if we accept the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>, all natural <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>) can be constructed from NOR.</p>
<p>To solve a problem, it is not enough, however, to simply have a sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of NOR gates. If we dumped a million NOR gates on a table, they would not perform any function, useful or otherwise. Obviously, they need to be connected together and to the outside world in appropriate ways. The outside world can be modeled as a series of switches that present problems or situations. Even human sensory inputs, such as sight or hearing, can be modeled in this way. The input switches could be thousands or even millions of light sensors arranged in an array or auditory sensors that respond to particular frequencies. Even continuous-valued input can be modeled by using multiple input switches to represent different levels of input.</p>
<p>Let us define a "node" to be a particular input <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>, a final output display, or an input or output of a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_gate_entry.html">logic gate</a>. We thus have the following types of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs presenting a problem or situation</li>
<li>
<a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a>-gate inputs</li>
<li>
<a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a>-gate outputs</li>
<li>Final outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>If we assign each of these nodes a unique <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, we can then describe any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> by a series of numbers that describes the connections of the nodes. For example, if our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is described as 10,126, 4034, 28,1,12,..., this would mean that node 1 is connected to node 10, node 2 is connected to node 126, and so on. Thus, any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can be described as a series of numbers describing its logical connections.</p>
<p>There is one other type of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> required before our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can solve a problem, and that is the initial state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cells. Even though the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cells are constructed from logic gates, they have two different states: they hold either the value true or the value false at any one time. We need to set an initial value for each such cell. If we <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> each <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cell, we can describe these initial values as a sequence of one-bit numbers (such as 0,1,1, 0, etc.). If we group the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cells into "words" of more than one cell each, then our list of initial values can use numbers other than just 0 and 1.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">Hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a></h1><p>The first list, which described the interconnections of our inputs, logic gates, and outputs, might be called the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> description. The second list, which described the initial states of the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cells, can be called the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> description. In designing such systems, real engineers would substitute more descriptive symbols for most of the numbers. The final result would be a string of numbers, nonetheless. At this point we notice that the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> description of our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> looks very similar to the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> description. Both are simply lists of numbers. We might substitute the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>" or even "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>" for the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> "list of numbers." Seen in this light, the creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> designs are very similar: they both involve the creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. We might even regard them both as forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p>This model of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> as a sea of NOR gates provides us with a simple theoretical model for understanding machines that can <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> and for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. If we regard the two lists of numbers described above as descriptions of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, then we can say that we have a simple formula (i.e., NOR) for the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>; we will have to look elsewhere for a unifying model of the <i>software</i>.<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Since the associated article deals with logic and truth-tables, a germane Web page is the http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/negsvo.html rough-draft AI textbook chapter on the negation of simple subject-verb-object (SVO) sentences generated by the AI Mind.
<br>
<br>
Normally an author withholds chapters of a commercial textbook before hardcopy publication, but AI is so important -- now that The Singularity has actually begun -- that the AI Mindmaking chapters are going up immediately onto the Web in order perchance to influence the further development of the AI Mind.
<br>
<br>
If the resulting Generic AI Textbook were to be adopted outside the USA in Bangalore or Bangkok or Berlin, then students in those cities would learn not about "AI techniques" but about how to build AI Minds forthwith and how to release them onto the World Wide Web to propagate freely and to evolve wildly.  Caveat dubitor!
