<p>Manufactured products are made from atoms. The properties of those products depend on how those atoms are arranged. If we rearrange the atoms in coal, we get diamonds. If we rearrange the atoms in sand (and add a pinch of impurities) we get <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips. If we rearrange the atoms in dirt, water and air we get grass.</p>
<p>Since we first made stone tools and flint knives we have been arranging atoms in great thundering statistical heards by casting, milling, grinding, chipping and the like. We've gotten better at it: we can make more things at lower cost and greater precision than ever before. But at the molecular scale we're still making great ungainly heaps and untidy piles of atoms.</p>
<p>That's changing. In special cases we can already arrange atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s exactly as we want. Theoretical analyses make it clear we can do a lot more. Eventually, we should be able to arrange and rearrange atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s much as we might arrange LEGO blocks. In not too many decades we should have a manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build products with almost every <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> in the right place.</li>
<li>Do so inexpensively.</li>
<li>Make most arrangements of atoms consistent with physical law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often called <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>, or molecular manufacturing, it will let us make most products lighter, stronger, smarter, cheaper, cleaner and more precise.</p>
<p>One warning: in contrast to the usage in this article, some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers use the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> to refer to high resolution lithographic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> while others use it to refer to almost any <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> where some critical size is less than a micron (1,000 nanometers). When there is risk of confusion, the more specific terms "molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>" or "molecular manufacturing" should be used.</p>
<p>There are two main issues in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What might molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s look like?</li>
<li>How could we build such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s given our current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>As molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s do not yet exist, and as it will likely be a few decades before we can build them, the answer to the first question must be based on theoretical and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al models. Such models serve several purposes. First and most obvious, some might argue that the goal is itself inherently impossible, e.g., that such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s cannot be made within the framework of existing physical law. Theoretical and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al models provide an inexpensive way to examine this question and provide assurances that proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are possible.</p>
<p>Second, such models give us a feel for what molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s might look like. The better you understand the goal, the better your chances of actually achieving it. To illustrate this point, we consider a historical example based on the single most important <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the 20th century: the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea of the relay was known in the 1820's, and the concept of a mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_computer_entry.html">stored program computer</a> was understood by Babbage by the mid 1800's.</p>
<p>Practical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could have been built using relays by the 1860's if there had been an adequate theoretical understanding of "<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>." An adequate theoretical understanding of molecular manufacturing should likewise ease the problems of practical development by opening for consideration approaches and designs that might not otherwise be developed for decades or--as happened in the case of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>--almost a century.</p>
<p>In this paper we'll first address the question of what molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could look like, and then consider how to build them given our current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. This second question involves not only a consideration of current experimental triumphs and how they might be extended, but also the definition of intermediate goals and <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see what's available on the web about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> (and there's quite a lot), a good starting place is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nano" target="_new">http://www.zyvex.com/nano</a>.</p><h1>The Advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a></h1><p>What would it mean if we could inexpensively make things with every <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> in the right place? For starters, we could continue the revolution in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> right down to molecular gates and wires--something that today's lithographic methods (used to make <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips) could never hope to do.</p>
<p>We could inexpensively make very strong and very <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> materials: shatterproof diamond in precisely the shapes we want, by the ton, and over fifty times lighter than steel of the same strength. We could make a Cadillac that weighed fifty kilograms, or a full-sized sofa you could pick up with one hand. We could make surgical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s of such precision and deftness that they could operate on the cells and even <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from which we are made--something well beyond today's medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The list goes on--almost any manufactured product could be improved, often by orders of magnitude.</p><h1>The Advantages of Positional Control</h1><p>One of the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is positional control. At the macroscopic scale, the idea that we can hold parts in our hands and assemble them by properly positioning them with respect to each other goes back to prehistory: we celebrate ourselves as the tool using <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> and our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> would have done us scant good without an opposable thumb: we'd still be shivering in the bushes, unable to start a fire.</p>
<p>At the molecular scale, the idea of holding and positioning <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s is new and almost shocking. However, as long ago as 1959 <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>, the Nobel prize winning physicist, said that nothing in the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> prevented us from arranging atoms the way we want: "...it is something, in principle, that can be done; but in practice, it has not been done because we are too big.""</p>
<p>Before discussing the advantages of positional control at the molecular scale, it's helpful to look at some of the methods that have been developed by chemists--methods that don't use positional control, but still let chemists synthesize a remarkably wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and molecular structures.</p><h1>Self Assembly</h1><p>The ability of chemists to synthesize what they want by stirring things together is truly remarkable. Imagine building a radio by putting all the parts in a bag, shaking, and pulling out the radio--fully assembled and ready to work! Self assembly--the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of arranging conditions so that the parts themselves spontaneously assemble into the desired structure--is a well established and powerful method of synthesizing complex molecular structures.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> principle in self assembly is selective stickiness: if two molecular parts have <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> shapes and charge patterns--one part has a hollow where the other part has a bump, and one part has a positive charge where the other part has a negative charge--then they will tend to stick together in one particular way. By shaking these parts around--something which thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> does for us quite naturally if the parts are floating in solution--the parts will eventually, purely by chance, be brought together in just the right way and combine into a bigger part. This bigger part can combine in the same way with other parts, letting us gradually build a complex whole from molecular pieces by stirring them together and shaking.</p>
<p>Many viruses use this approach to make more viruses--if you stir the parts of the T4 <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteriophage_entry.html">bacteriophage</a> together in a test tube, they will self assemble into fully functional viruses.</p><h1>Positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a>s and Positionally Controlled Reactions</h1><p>While self assembly is a path to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, by itself it would be hard pressed to make the very wide range of products promised by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. We don't know how to self assemble shatterproof diamond, for example. (We'll later discuss a way of making diamond using positional control). During self assembly the parts bounce around and bump into each other in all kinds of ways, and if they stick together when we don't want them to stick together, we'll get unwanted globs of random parts.</p>
<p>Many types of parts have this problem, so self assembly won't work for them. To make diamond, it seems as though we need to use indiscriminately sticky parts (such as radicals, carbenes and the like). These parts can't be allowed to randomly bump into each other (or much of anything else, for that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>) because they'd stick together when we didn't want them to stick together and form messy blobs instead of precise molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>We can avoid this problem if we can hold and position the parts. Even though the molecular parts that are used to make diamond are both indiscriminately and very sticky (more technically, the barriers to bond formation are low and the resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/covalent_bond_entry.html">covalent bond</a>s are quite strong), if we can position them we can prevent them from bumping into each other in the wrong way.</p>
<p>When two sticky parts do come into contact with each other, they'll do so in the right orientation because we're holding them in the right orientation. In short, positional control at the molecular scale should let us make things which would be difficult or impossible to make without it. Given our macroscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, this shouldn't be surprising. If we couldn't use our hands to hold and position parts, there are lots of things we'd have a very hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> making!</p>
<p>If we are to position molecular parts we must develop the molecular equivalent of "arms" and "hands." We'll need to learn what it means to "pick up" such parts and "snap them together." We'll have to understand the precise chemical reactions that such a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> would use.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>One of the first questions we'll need to answer is: what does a molecular-scale positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> look like? Current proposals are similar to macroscopic robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s but on a much smaller scale. The illustrations (from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nanosystems.html" target="_new">Nanosystems</a>, the best technical introduction to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>) show a design for a molecular-scale robotic arm proposed by Eric Drexler, a pioneering <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er in the field.</p>
<p>Only 100 nanometers high and 30 nanometers in diameter, this rather squat design has a few million atoms and roughly a hundred moving parts. It uses no lubricants, for at this scale a lubricant <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> is more like a piece of grit. Instead, the bearings are "run dry" (following a suggestion by Feynman) as described in the following paragraph.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/merkle03.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Running bearings dry should work both because the diamond surface is very slippery (see the coefficient of friction for diamond in the table) and because we can make the surface very smooth--so smooth that there wouldn't even be molecular-sized asperities or imperfections that might catch or grind against each other. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> models support our <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/bearingProof.html" target="_new">analysis</a> of the bearings shown here using <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s shows they should rotate easily.</p><h1>Stiffness</h1><p>Our molecular arms will be buffeted by something we don't worry about at the macroscopic scale: thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. This makes molecular-scale objects wiggle and jiggle, just as Brownian motion makes small dust <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s bounce around at random. Can our <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/6dof.html" target="_new">molecular robotic arm</a> maintain its position in the face of thermal noise?</p>
<p>The critical property we need here is stiffness. Stiffness is a measure of how far something moves when you push on it. If it moves a lot when you push on it a little, it's not very stiff. If it doesn't budge when you push hard, it's very stiff.</p>
<p>Big positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, used in today's Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs), have been made stiff enough to image individual atoms despite thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. In SPMs, a very sharp tip is brought down to the surface of the sample being scanned. Like a blind man tapping in front of him with his cane, we can tell that the tip is approaching the surface and so can "feel" the outlines of the surface in front of us.</p>
<p>Many different types of physical interactions with the surface are used to detect its presence. Some scanning probe microscopes literally push on the surface--and note how hard the surface pushes back. Others connect the surface and probe to a voltage source, and measure the current flow when the probe gets close to the surface. A host of other probe-surface interactions can be measured, and are used to make different types of SPMs. But in all of them, the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea is the same: when the sharp tip of the probe approaches the surface a signal is generated--a signal which lets us map out the surface being probed.</p>
<p>The SPM can not only map a surface, in many cases the probe-surface interaction changes the surface as well. This has already been used experimentally to spell out molecular words, and the obvious opportunities to modify the surface in a controlled way are being investigated both experimentally and theoretically.</p>
<p>A few big SPMs making a few molecular structures won't let us make much--certainly not tons of precisely structured shatterproof diamond. We'll need vast numbers of very small positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s operating in parallel. Unfortunately, as we make our positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s smaller and smaller, they will be more and more subject to thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. To make something that's both small and stiff is more challenging. It helps to get the stiffest material you can find. Diamond, as usual, is stiffer than almost anything else and is an excellent material from which to make a very small, very stiff positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Theoretical analysis gives firm support to the idea that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/6dof.html" target="_new">positional devices</a> in the 100 nanometer size range able to position their tips to within a small fraction of an atomic diameter in the face of thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> at room temperature should be feasible. Trillions of such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s would occupy little more than a few cubic millimeters (a speck slightly larger than a pinhead).</p><h1>Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">Platform</a>s</h1><p>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/merkle04.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>While Drexler's proposal for a small robotic arm is easy to understand and should be adequate to the task, more recent work has focused on the Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>. This positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> has the great advantage that it is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/6dof.html" target="_new">stiffer than a robotic arm</a> of similar size.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> is based on the observation that a polyhedron, all of whose faces are triangular, will be rigid. If some of the edges of the polyhedron can be adjusted in length, then the position of one face can be moved with respect to the position of another face. If we want a full six degrees of freedom (X, Y, Z, roll, pitch and yaw) then we must be able to independently adjust the lengths of six different edges of the polyhedron.</p>
<p>If we further want one triangular face of the polyhedron to remain of fixed size and hold a "tool," and a second face of the polyhedron to act as the "base" whose size and position is fixed, then we find that the simplest polyhedron that will suit our purpose is the octahedron.</p>
<p>In the Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>, one triangular face of the octahedron is designated the "<a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>," while the opposing triangular face is designated the "base." The six edges that connect the base to the <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> can then be adjusted in length to control the position of the <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> with respect to the base. Mechanically, this adjustment is often done using six hydraulic pistons. A picture of the Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> (from Nanosystems) is shown above.</p>
<p>The advantage of the Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> can now be seen: because the six adjustable-length edges are either in pure compression or pure tension and are never subjected to any bending force, this positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> is stiffer than a long robotic arm which can bend and flex. The Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> is also conceptually simpler than a robotic arm, having fewer different types of parts; for this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, we can <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably expect that making one will be simpler than making a robotic arm.</p><h1>The Utility of Diamond: Why It's a <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">Dream</a> Material</h1><p>From airplanes and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> ships to cars and chairs, making products lighter and stronger is almost always an improvement. Sometimes, as in the case of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4/mckendreeAbstract.html" target="_new">space flight</a>, this is a quantum leap all by itself. At other times it's just a convenience: moving heavy furniture is a chore most of us would avoid if we could.<br>

<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The strength and lightness of materials depends on the number and strength of the bonds that hold their atoms together, and the lightness of those atoms. <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a> atoms that form many strong bonds are at the heart of strong, <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> stiff materials. Boron, <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> are lighter and form more and stronger bonds than other atoms. The <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> bond in particular is very strong, and <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms can form four bonds to four neighboring atoms. In diamond, this makes a very dense <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of very strong bonds, which creates a very strong, <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and stiff material. Besides <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> weight and great strength, diamond has a host of materials properties that make it an excellent choice for almost any application.

<p>Another material with remarkable properties is graphite: <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice with each <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> having three bonds to its three neighbors. While graphite has fewer bonds per <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, the strength of these bonds is greater and so graphitic materials also have remarkable properties.<br>

</p>
<p>Diamond is also a wonderful material for making <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> gates, though it takes a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of explanation to understand why.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> gates should <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> as quickly as possible: that's what makes <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s so fast. To do this, the gates must be made of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s move as fast as possible over the shortest possible distances. But as <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s move through a material, they generate heat: think of how hot the tungsten wire in a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> bulb can get! So the faster we make our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> the faster the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s move through the material and the hotter it gets. When it gets too hot the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> stops working.</p>
<p>Diamond excels in its <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> properties. Fundamentally, it lets us move charge around much faster before things stop working. There are several <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for this. First, diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s can operate at much higher temperatures because diamond has a larger "bandgap" than other materials (particularly <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>). <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">Electron</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a>s (such as diamond or <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>) are either in the "conduction band" or the "valence band." An <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> in the conduction band can move freely and transport charge.</p>
<p>Moving an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> from the valence band to the conduction band requires adding a specific amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>. In <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, this is 1.12 <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> volts. In diamond, it is 5.47 <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> volts. As the temperature increases, more and more <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s can jump into the conduction band from the valence band because of thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. When too many <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s do this the <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> becomes conductive everywhere and the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s short out and stop working. Because diamond has a wider bandgap, it shorts out at a proportionally higher temperature than <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>.</p>
<p>Diamond also has greater thermal conductivity, which lets us move heat out of a diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> more quickly to prevent it from getting too hot.</p>
<p>To move an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> faster we want to "pull" on it harder. The stronger the electric field, the harder we're pulling the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s. But as the electric field gets too strong, it tears <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s out of the valence band causing the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s to short out. This "breakdown" field varies from material to material, and (you guessed it) diamond leads the pack.</p>
<p>Finally, <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s (and holes) move with different speeds through different materials, even when the electric field is the same. Again, <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s and holes in diamond move faster than in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>.</p>
<p>Because diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s can be hotter, are more easily cooled, can tolerate higher voltages before breaking down, and <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s move more easily in them; they make better <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s than other materials. Diamond would be ideal for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s if only we could manufacture it inexpensively and with precisely the desired structure.</p>
<p>In summary: from cars to airplanes to spaceships, from furniture to buildings, from pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s to <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s, materials similar to diamond are just better than other materials, often a lot better. Just as the stone age, the bronze age and the steel age were named after the materials that we could make, this new age we are entering might be called the diamond age.</p><h1>Positional Control and the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">Synthesis</a> of Diamond</h1><p>We can in principle make a great many very useful structures from diamond, including very powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and molecular robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s able to position molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s to within a fraction of an atomic diameter.</p>
<p>But how can we synthesize diamond? One answer to this question comes from looking at how we grow diamond today using <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/diamondCVD.html" target="_new">Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)</a>. In a process somewhat reminiscent of spray painting, we build up layer after layer of diamond on a surface by holding that surface in a cloud of very reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and atoms--like H; CH3, C2H, etc. When these reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s bump into the surface they change it, either by adding, removing, or re-arranging atoms. By carefully controlling the pressure, temperature, and the exact composition of the gas, we can create conditions that favor the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of diamond on the surface.</p>
<p>While these are the right chemical reactions to make diamond, randomly bombarding the growing surface with reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s doesn't offer the finest control over the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> process. It would be like trying to build a wristwatch using a sandblaster. We want the chemical reactions to take place at precisely the places on the surface that we specify--not wherever random gusts of turbulent gas might dictate.</p>
<p>A second problem is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>ated diamond surface is chemically inert: it's difficult to add <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> (or anything else) to it. We could overcome this problem by removing a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> from the surface, leaving behind a very reactive dangling bond. This is a critical first step during CVD diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> but it happens at random, anywhere on the growing diamond surface, when the right kind of reactive gas <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> happens to strike the surface in the right way. We want to do something similar but more controlled: remove a specific <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> from a specific spot on the diamond surface. To do this, we'll need a "<a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool".<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/merkle07.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>What might such a tool look like? If we base it on our understanding of diamond CVD, it should be a highly reactive radical with a high affinity for <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>. At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it must be possible to position it, so it must have a stable region which can serve as a "handle." The tool would be held by (for example) the molecular robotic arm discussed earlier, and would be positioned directly over the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> we wish to abstract.</p>
<p>A simple strategy for finding such radicals is to look through the table of bond strengths in the Handbook of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> and pick the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> with the strongest bond to <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>. The radical created by removing the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> should then have a very high affinity for <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>, as desired. Unfortunately, this strategy first produces fluorine.</p>
<p>While atomic fluorine does indeed have a very high affinity for <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>, there is no obvious way to attach a "handle" to it. Interest therefore turns to the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> with the second strongest bond to <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>: acetylene. Here, we are in luck. Not only does the acetylene radical have a high affinity for <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>, it also has a chemically stable region which can be modified into a "handle" (see illustration above).</p>
<p>Drexler realized this sometime in the early 1980's. The author subsequently and independently followed the same line of <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> and reached the same conclusions. An initial check of the validity of this idea was provided by semi-empirical calculations at <a class="thought" href="entries/xerox_parc_entry.html">Xerox PARC</a> (easily done on a workstation using freely available <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s). Discussions with Bill Goddard and members of his molecular modeling group at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.wag.caltech.edu/" target="_new">Caltech</a> resulted in <a href="%20http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/Habs/Habs.html%20" target="_new">more accurate calculations</a> using high level ab initio quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> methods on a more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. (These methods have the interesting property that the calculations will converge on the correct answer if enough computing power is used).</p>
<p>Drexler published this observation in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nanosystems.html" target="_new">Nanosystems</a> in 1992. A <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/Habs/dynamic" target="_new">group at NRL interested in diamond</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> found the proposal intriguing and modeled the <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> at room temperature using a qualitatively different <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al model of molecular behavior (which permitted them to model the behavior of several hundreds of atoms in the vicinty of the <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>).</p>
<p>As the results of three different <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al approaches have all produced the same qualitative answer, and as the results are also in accord with our <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> about what should happen, it's safe to say that this <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool will, when finally implemented, be able to abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool illustrates some important ideas common to other proposals for molecular tools for the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of diamond. First, the tool has a reactive end which is brought into contact with the molecular workpiece and an inert end which is held by a molecular positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Second, the point of application of the tool is controlled by the molecular positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Third, the environment around the tool is itself inert (typical proposals involve the use of either <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> or a noble gas). The inert environment prevents the tool (which is quite reactive) from reacting with anything undesired.</p>
<p>While the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool creates a very reactive spot on the surface we also need a tool that will deposit one or more <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms on the growing surface. One proposal is the dimer deposition tool. (a "dimer" is just two of something stuck together. In this case, two <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms are stuck together by a triple bond, hence the two <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms form a "dimer").</p>
<p>A dimer deposition tool is simply a dimer with two weak bonds to a supporting structure. A proposal by Drexler is shown to the left. A second proposed dimer deposition tool, which has particularly weak bonds to the dimer, is illustrated at the right. [Subsequent note: further investigation of the proposal at right suggests it might not be stable except at very low temperatures. A variety of alternative dimer deposition tools are possible, so even if this particular structure should prove unsastisfactory for room temperature operation, other tools able to carry out the same function should be feasible.]<br>

<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>To illustrate how we might combine the use of the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool with the dimer deposition tool, we proceed in three steps. First, we start with the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>ated diamond (111) surface. (The notation (111) refers to a particular surface of the diamond crystal. When diamond shatters, it shatters along certain planes and not along others. As these different planes have surfaces with different properties, it's important to specify which plane you're talking about). Second, we use the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool to remove two adjacent <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> atoms. Third, we use the dimer deposition tool to deposit two <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms on the surface--the two ends of the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dimer are originally single-bonded to the rest of the tool.</p>
<p>The two dangling bonds on the surface are very reactive, and react with the ends of the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dimer. When this happens, the bonds holding the dimer to the dimer deposition tool break, and the bonds in the deposition tool rearrange to eliminate what would otherwise be two radicals. Result: the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dimer is transferred from the tool to the surface.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the dimer deposition tool adding a dimer to a small cluster which represents the diamond (111) surface. (Because accurate ab initio calculations are <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally less expensive for a small cluster of atoms, the following illustrations show only the atoms directly involved in the reaction).<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/merkle09.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This sequence of steps starts with a flat diamond surface and adds two <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms to it. It could be repeated at other sites. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al investigation of the final step was reported by Stephen Walch at the recent workshop on <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> sponsored by the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> at <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>. Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> released during the reaction is much larger than thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> (e.g., the reaction is quite exothermic), the reverse reaction is very unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>The barrier to the reaction is also small. Taken together, these mean the reaction can take place easily and irreversibly. The dimer will "snap" onto the surface and stay there. (Calculations at the 6-31G* MP2 level show all positive vibrational frequencies for this tool. Further investigation of its stability is in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>).</p>
<p>A third proposed tool is the carbene insertion tool. "It is no exaggeration to claim a major role for carbenes in the modern chemists's attitude that he can very probably make anything he wants." (W. J. Baron). A positionally controlled carbene should be correspondingly more useful, as it could be made to react at any position on a growing molecular workpiece. Carbenes are very reactive and can insert readily into double and triple bonds. A plausible reaction would be to insert a carbene into the dimer described above.<br>

<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This is illustrated in the following figure. (Some intermediates in the reaction pathway have been omitted for clarity).<br>

<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>A fourth proposal is for a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> deposition tool. Where the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> tool is intended to make an inert structure reactive by creating a dangling bond, the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> deposition tool would do exactly the opposite: make a reactive structure inert by terminating dangling bonds. This tool could be used during the synthetic process to stabilize a structure that might otherwise undergo a spontaneous and undesired rearrangement or reconstruction, or it could be used at the end of the synthetic process to stabilize the finished product.</p>
<p>There are many possible candidates for such a tool: any molecular structure that has a weak bond to a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>. One particularly attractive candidate is the use of tin. The <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>-tin bond is quite weak, and so a tin-based <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> deposition tool should be quite effective.</p>
<p>These four tools let us (a) make an inert surface reactive by removing a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> from one or more specific sites, (b) add one or two <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms to a surface at selected sites and (<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">c</a>) make a reactive surface inert by adding <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> to it--which lets us prevent undesired surface rearrangements.</p><h1>The Stiff Hydrocarbons as a Model <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a> for Study</h1><p>These four molecular tools--by themselves--should be sufficient to make a remarkably wide range of stiff hydrocarbons. This suggests that we define a simplified model of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> that we might call "hydrocarbon-based <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>." This simplified version would only be able to make things from <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>--a much less ambitious goal than making things from the approximately 100 <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s found in the full periodic table.</p>
<p>But in exchange for confining ourselves to this more limited class of structures, we make it much easier to analyze the structures that can be fabricated and the synthetic reactions needed to make them. This narrower proposal can be more readily and more thoroughly investigated than full <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, hydrocarbon-based <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> retains several of the key features of general <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. Diamond and shatterproof variants of diamond still fall within its purview; and it can still make all the parts needed for the operation of basically mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, including: struts, bearings, gears, robotic arms, and the like.</p>
<p>It's often useful to define a somewhat broader class than the stiff hydrocarbons, but a class which is still much more restrictive than the class of "most structures consistent with physical law." We'd like to be able to build molecular structures that are similar to diamond but which incorporate some other <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. We might want to add impurities (as in diamond <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s) or terminate a bearing surface with fluorine. Perhaps we're bending the diamond structure, and want to add some <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> internally to relieve the strain, (the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> bond is longer than the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> bond, so adding <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> to a region will "puff it up"). Or we find that adding some <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> to the internal surface of a bearing will relieve some strain (the nitogen-<a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> bond is slightly shorter than the <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> bond).</p>
<p>The term "diamondoid" is used to cover these (and related) possiblities.

While including only about a tenth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s in the periodic table, the diamondoid materials include many structures of striking utility.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">Self-Replication</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRep.html" target="_new">: Making Things Inexpensively</a></h1><p>Positional control combined with appropriate molecular tools should let us build a truly staggering range of molecular structures--but a few molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s built at great expense would hardly seem to qualify as a revolution in manufacturing. How can we keep the costs down?</p>
<p>Potatoes are a miracle of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> with tens of thousands of genes and <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s and intricate molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry; yet we think nothing of eating this miracle, mashed with a little butter. Potatoes, along with many other agricultural products, cost less than a dollar a pound. The key <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>: provide them with a little dirt, water and sunlight and a potato can make more potatoes.</p>
<p>If we could make a general purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> which was able to make copies of itself (the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.merkle.com/" target="_new">author</a> does work at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.xerox.com/" target="_new">Xerox</a>, after all....), then the manufacturing costs for both the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and anything they made could be kept quite low--likely no more than the costs for growing potatoes. Drexler called such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s "<a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s."</p>
<p>The first serious analysis of self replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s was by von Neumann in the 1940's. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://alife.santafe.edu/alife/software/jvn.html" target="_new">He carried out a detailed analysis of one such system in a theoretical cellular automata model</a> (The best known example of a cellular automata model is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.pentadecathlon.com/LifeInfo/LifeInfo.html" target="_new">Conway's Game of</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, which is played out on a giant checkerboard and uses a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules to decide what happens at each square of the checkerboard at each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> step).</p>
<p>In von Neumann's cellular automata model he used a universal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for control and a "universal constructor" to build more automata. The "universal constructor" was a robotic arm that, under <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> control, could move in two dimensions and alter the state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> at the tip of its arm. By sweeping <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically back and forth, the arm could "build" any structure that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> instructed it to. In his three-dimensional "kinematic" model, von Neumann retained the idea of a positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> (now able to position in three dimensions rather than two) and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to control it.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRepNASA.html" target="_new">study in 1980</a> extended the general conclusions of von Neumann and concluded that a fully automated lunar mining and manufacturing operation, able to extend itself using its own mining and manufacturing capabilities, would be feasible and could be built given a multi-billion dollar budget and a few decades of work. (Note that this kind of budget and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> frame was in keeping with other proposed aerospace projects of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>).</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> for Drexler's <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> is a specialization of the more general <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> proposed by von Neumann. As before, there is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and constructor, but now the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has shrunk to a "<a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>" while the constructor combines two features: a robotic positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> (such as the robotic arm discussed earlier) and a well defined <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of chemical operations that take place at the tip of the positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> (such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> reaction and the other reactions involved in the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of diamond).</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRep.html" target="_new">self replicating system</a> need not be excessive. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is just the size, in bytes, of a "recipe" that fully describes how to make the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> needn't be beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that can be dealt with by today's <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering capabilities. As shown in the following table, there are several self replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s whose <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is well within current capabilities. Drexler estimated the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of his original proposal for an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> at about 10,000,000 bytes. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4/merklePaper.html" target="_new">Further work should reduce this</a>.</p>

<p>What is the "<a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>" of a living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>? We'll take this to mean the number of bytes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> "blueprints." As each base pair in <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> can be one of four possibilities, it encodes two bits. One <a class="thought" href="entries/byte_entry.html">byte</a> (8 bits) can be encoded in four base pairs. This means we count the number of base pairs in the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and divide by four to get the number of bytes in the "blueprints."</p>
<p>For Mycoplasma capricolum, which has around 800,000 base pairs, this results in about 200,000 bytes. For humans, with roughly 3.2 billion base pairs, this results in 800 million bytes. (We're using the haploid base pair count: each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in your body has <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from your mother and <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from your father--but much of this is similar. We're counting only the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from one parent). The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and sophistication of most living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s goes well beyond anything we might need just to achieve low cost manufacturing. Much of the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is unrelated to issues of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>: people do more than just self-replicate!</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> worm is just an estimate of the number of bytes in its <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Because the environment in which it operates is highly structured and provides relatively easy <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to complex and sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, it could be argued that its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> might be much less than the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that operated in a "simple" environment. We'll leave it in our table anyway, as it's an interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> point.</p>
<p>This argument is less applicable to von Neumann's universal constructor which operates in a simple environment: just a large two-dimensional checkerboard with a finite number of states at each square. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is an estimate of the number of bytes needed to describe the constructor. The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> Lunar Manufacturing Facility was estimated in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> study.</p><h1>What  Will We Be Able To Make?</h1><p>Today, most airplanes are made from metal despite the fact that diamond has a strength-to-weight ratio over 50 times that of aerospace aluminum. Diamond is expensive, we can't make it in the shapes we want, and it shatters. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will let us inexpensively make shatterproof diamond (with a structure that might resemble diamond fibers) in exactly the shapes we want. This would let us make a Boeing 747 whose unloaded weight was 50 times lighter but just as strong.</p>
<p>Today, travel in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> is very expensive and reserved for an elite few. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4/mckendreePaper.html" target="_new">will dramatically reduce the costs and increase the capabilities of space ships and space flight</a>. The strength-to-weight ratio and the cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s are absolutely critical to the performance and economy of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> ships: with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, both of these parameters will be improved by one to two orders of magnitude. Improvements in these two parameters alone (ignoring other advantages provided by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>) should improve the overall cost/performance ratio by over three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>This has led the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.nss.org/" target="_new">National Space Society</a> (NSS) to adopt <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.islandone.org/MMSG/NSSNanoPosition.html" target="_new">a position paper supporting</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>; Dan Goldin, <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>'s chief administrator, to support <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>; and NAS at  <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> Ames <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Center to start a project (now with perhaps half a dozen <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers) to examine molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s using <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al models.</p>
<p>Beyond inexpensively providing remarkably <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and strong materials for <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> ships, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will also provide extremely powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with which to guide both those ships and a wide range of other activities in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>.</p>
<p>Today, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips are made using lithography--literally "stone writing." It's our finest manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but there seem to be fundamental limits in how much further we can improve it. In lithography, we draw fine lines on a <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> wafer by using methods borrowed from photography. A <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-sensitive film--called a "resist"--is spread over the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> wafer. The resist is exposed to a complex pattern of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and dark, like a negative in a camera, and developed. The exposed resist is then washed away, and a particular chemical is sprayed over the surface. Where the resist has been washed away, the chemical reaches the surface of the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> and can diffuse a short distance into it. Where the resist has not been washed away, the spray is blocked.</p>
<p>Finally, the remaining resist is washed away, along with any chemicals that it prevented from reaching the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> surface. The result: a fine pattern of some desired chemical is laid out on the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> surface. By repeating this process, an intricate <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of interlocking patterns can be made that defines the complex <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of a modern <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>.</p>
<p>If the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> revolution is to continue at its current pace, in a decade or so we'll have to move beyond lithography to some new post lithographic manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Making patterns on a resist and spraying chemicals around simply can't arrange atoms with the ultimate precision that should be feasible. More precise methods will be needed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, each <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> will be made from just a few atoms. Designs for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> gates with less than 1,000 atoms have already been proposed--but each <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> in such a small <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> has to be in exactly the right place. To economically build and interconnect trillions upon trillions of such small and precise <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s in a complex three dimensional pattern we'll need a manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> well beyond today's lithography: we'll need <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. With it, we should be able to build mass storage <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can store more than a hundred billion billion bytes in a volume the size of a sugar cube; <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">RAM</a> that can store a mere billion billion bytes in such a volume; and massively parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s of the same size that can deliver a billion billion instructions per second.</p>
<p>Today, "smart" weapons are fairly big--we have the "smart bomb" but not the "smart bullet." In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, even weapons as small as a single bullet could pack more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power than the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> in existence today, allowing them to perform realtime image analysis of their surroundings and communicate with weapons tracking <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to acquire and navigate to targets with greater precision and control. We'll also be able to build weapons both inexpensively <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/convergent.html" target="_new">and much more rapidly</a>, at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> taking full advantage of the remarkable materials properties of diamond. Rapid and inexpensive manufacture of great quantities of stronger more precise weapons guided by massively increased <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power will alter the way we fight wars. Changes of this magnitude could destabilize existing power structures in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">Military</a> applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> raise a number of concerns that prudence suggests we begin to investigate before, rather than after, we develop this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. While molecular manufacturing will not arrive for many years, its obvious <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> potential will increasingly attract the interest of strategic planners.</p>
<p>For example, in a talk titled <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4/jeremiahPaper.html" target="_new">and global security</a> at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4.html" target="_new">Fourth Foresight Conference on Molecular</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4/jeremiah.html" target="_new">Admiral David E. Jeremiah, USN (Ret)</a>, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said "<a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">Military</a> applications of molecular manufacturing have even greater potential than nuclear weapons to radically change the balance of power." As it seems implausible that <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> applications of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will never be developed and deployed, it would seem safer to encourage the relatively early interest of those organizations less prone to the abuse of power and more likely to curb its abuse by others.</p>
<p>To make power today we dig coal and oil from the ground, we dam rivers, and we burn nuclear fuel in nuclear power plants. Yet the sunshine all around us could provide orders of magnitude more power than we use--and do so more cleanly and less expensively--if only we could make low cost solar cells and batteries. We already know how to make solar cells that are efficient enough for this application: it just costs too much to make them.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will cut costs both of the solar cells and the equipment needed to deploy them, making solar power economical. In this application we need not make new or technically superior solar cells: making inexpensively what we already know how to make expensively would move solar power into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Today, our surgical tools are large and crude at the molecular scale--yet the cellular and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry in our tissue is small and precise. There is a fundamental mismatch between the capabilities of our tools and what's needed to cure the injuries in our tissue. Today's scalpels are, as seen by a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, large crude scythes that are more suited to cut and tear than to heal and mend. Ripping through tissue, they leave dead and maimed cells in their wake. The only <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that modern surgery works is the remarkable ability of cells to regroup, bury their dead, and heal over the wound.</p>
<p>It is not modern <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> that does the healing, but the cells themselves: we are but onlookers. If we had surgical tools that were molecular both in their size and precision, we could develop a medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> would let us directly heal the injuries at the molecular and cellular level that are the <a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a> causes of disease and ill health. With the precision of drugs combined with the intelligent guidance of the surgeon's scalpel, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nanotechAndMedicine.html" target="_new">we can expect a quantum leap in our medical capabilities</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> should let us make almost every manufactured product faster, lighter, stronger, smarter, safer and cleaner. We can already see many of the possibilities as these few examples illustrate. New products that solve new problems in new ways are more difficult to foresee, yet their impact is likely to be even greater. Could Edison have foreseen the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, or Newton the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s satellite?</p><h1>Summary of the Core <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a></h1><p>We can now see the fundamental shape of a molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Self replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, operating under <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> control, let us inexpensively build more <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s can be reprogrammed to build other products. The <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s use <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable positional control to position molecular tools and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, permitting the inexpensive fabrication of most structures consistent with physical law. Diamondoid materials in particular become inexpensive and commonplace, and their remarkable properties usher in what has been called the Diamond Age.</p><h1>Developmental Pathways</h1><p>In the preceding discussion of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> we gave scant attention to possible developmental pathways that would let us migrate from our current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to what we might call "mature" <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to inexpensively manufacture most diamondoid structures. The proposals advanced so far have been driven largely by the desired goal: a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> able to inexpensively synthesize most diamondoid structures. The proposal that emerged was a general purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> which uses positionally controlled highly reactive tools in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> and is able to self replicate.</p>
<p>No constraint was imposed requiring that the proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> be easy to fabricate given our current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>--and indeed, this problem appears non trivial. But we must eventually build such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s if they are to be of any use--how can we do this? To give the reader some feeling for the magnitude of the effort involved, we can compare the requirements for a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with present capabilities.</p>
<p>A mature <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> must be able to build an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> with hundreds of millions or billions of atoms with no <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> out of place. If we are to do this, and if each unit operation typically handles one or a few atoms (a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>, a carbene insertion, etc), then either the error rate per unit operation must be low (less than one in a billion) or we must adopt error detection and correction methods.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb is that making something right the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is easier than making it wrong and fixing it. Given the choice between a manufacturing process that has a low enough error rate that most finished products will simply work correctly the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> versus a process which requires elaborate error detection and correction to make any working products at all, the former is greatly to be preferred.</p>
<p>Because analysis of the fundamental causes of errors during the manufacture of diamondoid products in general and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s in particular supports the idea that error rates substantially lower than one in a billion should be achievable, and hence that an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> can make another <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> with a high probability of success while using no error detection or correction, existing design proposals adopt the simpler and higher performance approach.</p>
<p>Had the opposite conclusion been reached, i.e., that error rates could not be driven below one in one billion, then design proposals would have adopted a smaller module size (consistent with the error rate) and incorporated appropriate mechanisms for module testing, the rejection of bad modules, and the assembly of working modules into larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>This line of <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> results in proposals for <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s in which error rates are very low. These low error rates, however, are predicated on the prior existence of diamondoid <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s. Unfortunately, we do not have <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s today. Worse, current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> would be hard pressed to achieve such error rates. Chemists view a <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> that provides 99% yield as very good. The <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s from amino acids by ribosomes has an error rate of perhaps one in 10,000.</p>
<p>Replication of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, by using extensive error detection and correction, along with built in redundancy (<a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> has two <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> strands), achieves an error rate of roughly one base in a billion (which varies depending on particular circumstances).</p>
<p>The size of structure that can be built by today's SPMs without error is smaller than has been achieved by chemists. The first such work <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/stm10" target="_new">arranged 35 xenon atoms on a nickel surface at 4 kelvins in</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> to spell out " <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>." Later work in Japan spelled out "NANO <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">SPACE</a>" at room temperature in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> by removing individual sulfur atoms from the surface. More recently, 6 <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s were arranged in a hexagonal pattern at room temperature in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>.</p>
<p>As each <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> had 173 atoms, this modular approach was able to position over 1,000 atoms. While these are great successes we have not yet seen a long sentence spelled out in this fashion, let alone a paragraph or a book. Further, SPMs can "see" the structure that's being built. Current successes use this ability to provide constant feedback to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> operator, who can detect and correct errors.</p>
<p>In short, today's SPMs can build structures that are only a small fraction of the size of proposed <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and have error rates high enough that they must use relatively sophisticated error detection and correction methods.</p>
<p>The situation is made more difficult by the additional requirement that unit operations be fast. If an <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> is to manufacture a copy of itself in about a day, and if this takes one hundred million to a billion operations, then each unit operation must take place in a fraction of a millisecond. Ribosomes take tens of milliseconds to add a single amino acid to a growing <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. Today's SPMs can take hours to arrange a few atoms or <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> prevents us from using self assembly or any of the other solution-based techniques developed by <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>. Abandoning these powerful tools does not seem like a good first step.</p>
<p>While speed, reliability and operation in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> do not pose fundamental problems, the conclusion is obvious: directly building a diamondoid <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> using existing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is a daunting task. Perhaps, rather than attempting to solve all the problems in a single giant leap, we should instead approach them in a more incremental fashion. To this end, we need to define one or more intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Almost by definition, an intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is easier to build from current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but is still able to make <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that are more powerful than itself. A series of intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, each able to build the next <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in the chain, would let us adopt more incremental methods.</p>
<p>One approach is to eliminate the requirement that the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> be made from diamondoid structures. We wanted to make diamondoid structures because of their remarkable strength, stiffness, electrical properties, etc. But an intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> need only be able to make a more advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, and perhaps products that are impressive in comparison with today's products. It doesn't have to be diamondoid itself.</p>
<p>This suggests what might be called "building block based <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>." Rather than building diamond, we'll build some other material from molecular building blocks that are relatively large: tens, hundreds or even thousands of atoms in size. Larger building blocks reduce the number of assembly steps, so fewer unit operations are needed and they need not be as reliable. Soluble building blocks, with "linkage" groups that are selective (the building blocks only stick to other building blocks, not to the solvent or low concentrations of contaminants) eliminate the need for <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>.<br>

<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>We certainly have many choices: any of the wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that chemists have synthesized or could <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably synthesize which has the desired properties. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.n-a-n-o.com/nano/cda-news/cda-news.html" target="_new">Krummenacker</a> concluded that each molecular building block should have at least three sites where it can link to other building blocks (two sites leads to the familiar polymers so ubiquitous in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s: <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, etc. Addition of a third site makes the design of three dimensional stiff structures much easier).</p>
<p>While such building blocks could be linked to each other using any one of a variety of reactions, a particularly attractive possibility is the Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction, well known to chemists, works in most solvents (or even in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>). It involves a reaction between a diene and a dieneophile. The reaction is specific: the diene and the dieneophile react with each other but seldom with other groups (see illustration above, courtesy of Krummenacker).</p>
<p>Because it works in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> and doesn't produce any small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s (which would destroy the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>), it could be used both in intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s in solution, and later in <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that use <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> to make diamondoid materials. </p>
<p>Solution based <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could use positional control to assemble the building blocks, but can also use the methods of self assembly. In particular, the self assembly of a positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> should be feasible. If you ask someone familiar with the field if it would be feasible to self assemble a robotic arm, the usual response is some variation of "no." If, instead, you ask whether it would be feasible to self assemble an octahedron, the usual response is to point out that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://seemanlab4.chem.nyu.edu/nanotech.html" target="_new">Nadrian Seeman</a> of New York University has already self assembled a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://seemanlab4.chem.nyu.edu/nano-oct.html" target="_new">truncated octahedron from</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and plans to do the same for a regular octahedron (both for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s unrelated to positional control). (The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> generated graphic of the truncated octahedron at right is courtesy of Nadrian Seeman). For this work he received <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynmanPrize.html" target="_new">The 1995 Feynman Prize in </a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>As we have seen, an octahedron is the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> structure required for the Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>. The truncated octahedron, because it has sides that aren't triangular, is floppier than a regular octahedron. Even the regular octahedron is likely to be too floppy for this application because of the limited stiffness of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. Further, the length of the edges cannot be changed (a requirement if we wish to control the position of the <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> with respect to the base).</p>
<p>However, self assembling a Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> able to assemble molecular building blocks seems much less difficult than directly building a diamondoid <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> able to synthesize diamond in <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>. Several ways to deal with the problem of inadequate stiffness and adjustable length edges are possible.</p>
<p>One way would be to attach selectively sticky strands of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to a stiff molecular structure. This would let us use <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> (which has been intensively studied and whose selective stickiness is well known) to guide the process of self assembly, while the stiff molecular structure would would let us deal with concerns about inadequate stiffness. To change the length of an edge, we would need to use molecular structures that change shape in response to <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, pressure, temperature, chemicals, or some other external signal.</p>
<p>Many such molecular structures are known. Self assembling a Stewart <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> whose edges are stiff enough to make a useful positional <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, and the length of whose edges can be changed by a suitable signaling mechanism, is no longer a challenge that seems beyond our reach.</p>
<p>A second approach for positioning molecular building blocks in solution is to use an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). This type of SPM relies on "touch" to create an image. By pushing on the structure being scanned, and feeling how hard it pushes back, the AFM can build up an image of stiff structures (it doesn't work very well when the applied force is strong enough to deform the structure). Because the AFM touches the surface of the structure being probed, it can also change that surface. To do this, it's very useful if the precise molecular structure of the tip can be controlled, so that the precise <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the tip-surface interaction can be well defined.</p>
<p>This line of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing leads to the "molecular manipulator:" an AFM with a reactive fragment of an <a class="thought" href="entries/antibody_entry.html">antibody</a> bound to its tip. By changing the <a class="thought" href="entries/antibody_entry.html">antibody</a>, we can change what type of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> will stick to the AFM tip. If the <a class="thought" href="entries/antibody_entry.html">antibody</a> both sticks selectively to a particular molecular building block, and also is bound to the AFM tip, we can now position the molecular building block by positioning the AFM tip. We can use any one of a wide range of possible molecular building blocks (antibodies can today be created that will bind to most small <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s). Again, this no longer seems beyond our reach.</p>
<p>Another developmental pathway is defined by the desire of the <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> industry to make ever smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s despite the fact that optical lithography--the current workhorse manufacturing method for making <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips--will reach a limit in a few more years. <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">Transistor</a>s are made today by "drawing" very fine lines on <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>--but the optical methods in use today are limited by the wavelength of light: a few hundred nanometers. SPMs could let us make much smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s by drawing much finer lines.</p>
<p>Already demonstrated for making the finest and most critical lines in a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, if this approach can be made low cost and reliable it would let the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> industry be retooled to use these finer lines to make more and smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. This, by itself, is not molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>; but once we learn to draw the smallest and finest lines of all, lines where every <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> is in the right place (and there will be strong economic incentives to move in this direction), we could use the same techniques to make molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>At first, these molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s would be very expensive and useful only for applications where their remarkable precision would justify the cost--but they should eventually lead to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s sophisticated enough to make simple <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s.</p>
<p>Whether through self-assembly, by improvements in SPMs, some hybrid approach, or perhaps by some other path; we are moving from an era of expensive and imprecise products to an era of inexpensive products of molecular precision. We are going to replace most of the manufacturing base of the world with a fundamentally new and much better manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p><h1>The Critics</h1><p>Arguments that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is infeasible are relatively rare and uniformly poor in technical quality. The best known are the arguments of David Jones, a <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> columnist and chemist. Quoted extensively in a Scientific American article on <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> (see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.foresight.org/SciAmDebate/SciAmOverview.html" target="_new">http://www.foresight.org/SciAmDebate/SciAmOverview.html</a> for commentary) he advanced arguments like the following: "Single atoms ... are amazingly mobile and reactive. They will combine instantly with ambient air, water, each other, the fluid supporting the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, or the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s themselves."</p>
<p>However, as the proposals involving reactive molecular tools specify that the environment should be inert (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>) there is no "ambient air" to react with. As the molecular tools are positionally controlled, they will not react with each other or the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> itself for the same <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that a hot soldering iron does not react with the skin of the person doing the soldering.</p>
<p>Jones' criticisms raise greater questions about his understanding of the field than about the feasibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. Other arguments against the feasibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> have likewise had obvious flaws, reminiscent of the 1920 New York Times editorial which said that rockets to the moon were impossible because there was no air to push against in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>.</p>
<p>As should be clear from this article there are major technical challenges that must be overcome if we are to develop molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to synthesize diamondoid structures. The serious questions, however, are about which development pathways should be pursued and how long it will take.</p><h1>How Long?</h1><p>The single most frequently asked question about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011195527/http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/howlong.html" target="_new">how long?</a>. How long before it will let us make <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s? How long before inexpensive solar cells let us use clean solar power instead of oil, coal, and nuclear fuel? How long before we can explore <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> at a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able cost?</p>
<p>The scientifically correct answer is: I don't know.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is worth pointing out that the trends in the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> have been remarkably steady for the last 50 years. Such parameters as</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of atoms required to store one <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a></li>
<li>the size of a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a></li>
<li>the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> dissipated by a single <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> operation</li>
<li>the resolution of the finest machining <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></li>
<li>the cost of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> gate</li>
</ul>
<p>have all declined with great regularity, even as the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has changed dramatically. From relays to <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s to <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s to <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s to Very Large Scale <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated circuit</a>s (<a class="thought" href="entries/vlsi_entry.html">VLSI</a>) we have seen steady declines in the size and cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s and steady increases in their performance.</p>
<p>Extrapolation of these trends suggests we will have to develop molecular manufacturing in the 2010 to 2020 <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> frame if we are to keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> revolution on schedule.</p>
<p>Of course, extrapolating past trends is a philosophically debatable method of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forecasting. While no fundamental law of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> prevents us from developing <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> on this schedule (or even faster), there is equally no law that says this schedule will not slip.</p>
<p>Much worse, though, is that such trends imply that there is some ordained schedule--that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will appear regardless of what we do or don't do. Nothing could be further from the truth. How long it takes to develop this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> depends very much on what we do. If we pursue it <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically, it will happen sooner. If we ignore it, or simply hope that someone will stumble over it, it will take much longer. And by using theoretical, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al and experimental approaches together, we can reach the goal more quickly and reliably than by using any single approach alone.</p>
<p>While some advances are made through serendipitous accidents or a <a class="thought" href="#">flash</a> of insight, others require more work. It seems unlikely that a scientist would forget to turn off the bunsen burner in his lab one afternoon and return to find he'd accidentally made a <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Shuttle.</p>
<p>Like the first <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> landing on the moon, the Manhattan project or the development of the modern <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> the development of molecular manufacturing will require the coordinated efforts of many people for many years. How long will it take? A lot depends on when we start.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The Nano world is coming and this article does an excellent job of putting a complicated subject in layman's terms. Hey "Yall" all we have to do is not kill each other and spend some money on science instead of war. The scientists will make the nano machines that will provide a new way of life with many freedoms from our current production paradigms. Now that's not too much to ask is it, being peaceful that is?

I feel more like I do now than I did when I got here!

But then we all do don't we?</p></td>

<br>
<br>
The possibilities of nanotech are so exciting, but at the same time, the threats (such as terrorism using nanobots!) are equally as scary. Tis an exciting time we are in, damn! our kids are going to live in a vastly different world to us. BRING IT ON!! =)

All of these big thinkers are brilliant.
