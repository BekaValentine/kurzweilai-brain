<div class="TeaserText">Former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke&#8217;s BREAKPOINT novel, set in the year 2012, is based on emerging technologies. "Globegrid," a high-speed global network, links supercomputers worldwide. Combined with advanced AI software, it promises to reverse-engineer the brain, revolutionize genomics, enable medical breakthroughs, develop advanced human-machine interfaces, and allow for genetic alterations and even uploading consciousness. But it spurs a terrorist-fundamentalist Luddite backlash against transhumanists, as hackers take down the power grid, and destroy vital international data and telecom links, communications satellites, and biotech firms. </div>

<h2>Author's Note </h2>
<p> In <em>The Scorpion&#8217;s Gate</em>, I projected a world in 
              2010, with the United States and China competing politically and 
              economically for a dwindling supply of increasingly expensive oil 
              and gas. That competition naturally took them to the Persian Gulf, 
              where the largest oil deposits remained.&#160; The Persian Gulf 
              of 2010 was unstable, with the United States threatening Iran, and 
              fundamentalist Islamic forces emerging in Saudi Arabia.&#160; Corruption 
              and giant corporations made Washington a political battleground.&#160; 
              While I noted at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of publication that the work was not meant 
              to be predictive, many of the trends in the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> have developed 
              and are dominating the news. <br>
<em>Breakpoint</em>, <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in 2012, is meant to be predictive, at 
              least about <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; It may read to some like <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, 
              but it is based on emerging technologies that are the subject of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> today.&#160; Scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers differ in their views 
              about when the research will result in deployed technology, but 
              their differences are most often a discussion of &#8220;when,&#8221; 
              not &#8220;if.&#8221;</p>
<p> This novel is intended to project you a few years ahead, to start 
              readers <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> now about the political, social, and economic changes 
              that technology is about to create. Those changes could be wrenching, 
              creating tensions in our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.&#160; A woman&#8217;s right to 
              choose, the teaching of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, and stem-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> research have already 
              created social and political discord in the United States.&#160; 
              The coming technological events may make these current controversies 
              seem like a practice round, a warm-up.&#160; For the next debate 
              may be about &#8220;what is a human&#8221;: Should humans change 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s and genetic alterations?</p>
<p> The opening rounds have already occurred.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">Transhuman</a>ist 
              movement is real and has regular meetings around the country.&#160; 
              In 2002, the National <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Foundation issued a stunning report, 
              &#8220;Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance: 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">Information Technology</a> and Cognitive 
              Science.&#8221; The report, which overall has an upbeat and optimistic 
              tone, concludes that connections between the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              will transform the way humans work, other technologies will eliminate 
              disabilities and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s that have plagued the human condition 
              for centuries, and human <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> will flourish due to both improved 
              understanding of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> and enhancements to the brain. A 
              year later, the President&#8217;s Council on Bioethics issued its 
              report, &#8220;Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of 
              Happiness&#8221; which took a somewhat dimmer view of using technology 
              to enhance human beings. Chaired by Leon Kass, a fellow at the American 
              Enterprise Institute, the commission included conservative political 
              figures such as Francis Fukuyama and Charles Krauthammer. They believe 
              that genetic science should not be used to enhance human performance, 
              only to fix mistakes that make some humans less healthy than the 
              norm.&#160; In 2004, Californians voted on a referendum on stem 
              cell research and approved funding for research.&#160; Court fights 
              have delayed the spending of state monies.</p>
<p> As to some of the specifics in <em>Breakpoint</em>:</p>
<p> -- The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of Globegrid arises from the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s 
              in Japan, the United States, and Russia have already been linked 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 2, a new high speed <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed being developed by 
              a consortium of 207 universities.&#160; U.S. and European labs are 
              actually engaged in a project to reverse engineer the human brain.</p>
<p> -- Living <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> does not yet exist, but companies like Watchfire 
              Fortify, Coverity, and others are already developing software to 
              test software for human error. </p>
<p> -- Very <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a> Jets (VLJs) have been approved by the U.S. Federal 
              Aviation Administration and are in manufacture. They are four-to-six 
              seat aircraft meant to operate like taxis.&#160; Eclipse Aviation&#8217;s 
              Eclipse500 and Citation&#8217;s CJ-1 are among the first deployed 
              VLJs. </p>
<p> -- Intelligent video surveillance, in which the software and cameras 
              (not people) recognize aberrant behavior, are already being deployed 
              by companies such as DVTel and Vidient in subways, airports, and 
              other facilities. </p>
<p> -- Exoskeleton suits are already in the prototype phase. The U.S. 
              Army has teamed with the University of California at Berkeley to 
              develop the prototype, which will allow soldiers to carry 180 pounds 
              while feeling as if they were lugging five. Plans on the drawing 
              board at the Army&#8217;s Natick Labs in Massachusetts show soldiers 
              being able to run, jump, and throw the way they are described in 
              the baseball game in <em>Breakpoint</em>. The other capabilities 
              that make up the full suite of technologies in the exoskeleton suits 
              (night vision, network connections, <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a>, remote cameras, and vital-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              monitoring) are all part of a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> called the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">Object</a>ive Force 
              Warrior Ensemble, set to be deployed by 2010. </p>
<p> -- People in the United States will be driving Chinese-manufactured 
              cars like the Chery product line in 2007-08.&#160; Cars powered 
              by ethanol derived from <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> grass exist today.</p>
<p> -- Driven by the large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of U.S. casualties in Iraq, Marine 
              and Army amputees are now receiving <a class="thought" href="entries/prosthetics_entry.html">prosthetics</a> far more advanced 
              than what is available in the civilian community. Known as sea legs, 
              these new prosthetics are driven by <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>s at each joint. 
              They use innovative new materials and techniques to respond to signals 
              from the human brain to straighten a leg or flex a muscle. Servicemen 
              and women who once would have been unable to lead normal civilian 
              lives are now able to return to the battlefield. </p>
<p>-- Human nerves have already connected artificial ears directly 
              to the brain. Paralyzed patients are today using their <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s 
              to move computer <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.&#160; Some patients suffering from 
              severe depression and other disorders already do have miniature 
              wires leading to parts of their brain and do have battery packs 
              implanted behind their collarbones. Other Human-Machine Interfaces 
              (HMIs) are in development. </p>
<p> -- Artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s for people suffering from blindness caused 
              by diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration 
              are in the development phase and have already seen some success 
              in restoring limited vision in clinical trials. The devices work 
              by implanting a small <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> at the back of the eye that stimulates 
              retinal <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. They are powered by solar receptors fed by the 
              light that enters the eye. Replacing the full eye with a <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>-based 
              optical unit may be feasible, but is also likely that the ability 
              to regenerate or transplant an eye may happen sooner and be more 
              appealing.</p>
<p> -- The state of cyber security described in the novel is, unfortunately, 
              not fiction. Identities (name, date of birth, Social Security number, 
              credit-card number) are bought and sold in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a> chat 
              rooms.&#160; Software coding errors are regularly used by hackers 
              to enter networks and computers.&#160; Scientists at U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> 
              national laboratories have demonstrated the possibility of taking 
              down the power grid through hacking.</p>
<p>--The company iRobot has sold large numbers of robots to clean 
              floors. Asimov, the robotic dog, could easily be a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> in the 
              near term. Sony&#8217;s Aibo already can mimic the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s of a 
              &#8220;real&#8221; dog. Moving from Aibo to the fictional Asimov 
              will require adding <a class="thought" href="entries/voice_recognition_entry.html">voice recognition</a> technology, a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> web 
              link, limited artificial-<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> capabilities, and advanced 
              motor devices to power its arms and legs. In some form or another, 
              these technologies all exist today.</p>
<p> -- Performance-enhancing <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s (PEPs) is my own name, 
              but&#160; the concept is not fiction. For <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> enhancement, a 
              compound known as CX717 has proven effective in boosting the brain 
              chemical glutamate, the substance that is key in <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and memory. 
              Studies have shown it effective in treating narcolepsy and ADD. 
              It has also proven effective for otherwise healthy <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s who 
              need to stay focused over longer periods without sleep. For sports, 
              regulatory authorities are fighting an uphill battle, with gene 
              doping and performance enhancing pharmaceuticals becoming more sophisticated, 
              more effective, and safer than steroids.&#160; The Pentagon is developing 
              drugs that will allow soldiers to go for long periods without sleeping.</p>
<p> -- Cellular regeneration of organs and other body parts is in 
              its infancy but will likely yield real-world results by the end 
              of this decade. <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">Embryo</a>nic <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s are thought to hold the most 
              promise for treating a wide range of maladies, from <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> to spinal 
              injuries. Human adult stem cells are already used to treat a variety 
              of ailments. Fixing retinas, cloning hair for baldness, and regrowing 
              teeth are all showing promise.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> on stem cell research 
              has slowed due to the Bush administration&#8217;s unwillingness 
              to fund research on embryonic stem cells. This decision has slowed 
              progress and shifted much work overseas, where governments have 
              embraced the promise of this research. It is quite possible the 
              United States will be left behind in what will be the most pivotal 
              medical advance since the decoding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>.</p>
<p> -- Aircraft without onboard pilots are already in use.&#160; I 
              fought a bureaucratic battle with CIA in 2000 to get them to use 
              the unmanned Predator to hunt for terrorists and in 2001 to arm 
              the Predator with missiles. When Predator finally was used to attack 
              terrorists in Afghanistan and Yemen, it was probably the first time 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> intentionally killed a human. The U.S. Air Force is now 
              developing UCAVs, unmanned combat aerial vehicles, fighter planes 
              whose pilots will sit safely on the ground hundreds or thousands 
              of miles away from the aircraft. Lockheed has plans for an unmanned 
              version of the F-35. </p>
<p> -- The <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> gun depicted in <em>Breakpoint</em> is a technology 
              set to emerge sometime within the next decade, depending on the 
              prioritization it receives in Pentagon budget negotiations. The 
              Airborne Laser is being built by Boeing to mount a laser on a 747 
              for use against ballistic missiles. When the Joint Strike Fighter 
              (JSF) was first put on the drawing board in 2001, plans called for 
              a solid-state laser as an offensive <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>.&#160; Although it has 
              been delayed, The Lightweight Tactical Laser weapon&#160; may now 
              be incorporated in the F-35 block 30. </p>
<p> -- The initial mapping of the human genome was complete in 2000. 
              Detailed mapping of the individual <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s is under way, with 
              most of the existing human chromosomes already mapped. The first 
              genetic therapy was approved to treat patients in 1990. Today, genetic 
              therapy is used to fix flaws in some human coding, including sickle-cell 
              anemia, Huntington&#8217;s disease, cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. 
            </p>
<p> -- Nanotechnology is already in use in cosmetics, tennis racquets, 
              paints, and fabrics. The National Nanotechnology Initiative is the 
              largest new federal science project in recent years. Researchers 
              have successfully used gold nanoparticles to deliver <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s

<p align="center"><strong>BREAKPOINT</strong><br>
<strong>By</strong><br>
<strong>Richard A. Clarke</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Readers want suspense, a fast pace and, most of all, 
              the illusion they&#8217;re getting a glimpse of how things work 
              in the clandestine inner circles of power.&#160; Clarke&#8217;s 
              book delivers on all these scores.&#160; And in his case, the insiderness 
              is no illusion.&#160; Unlike most novelists, the man has actually 
              been there and done that.&#8221;&#160; </em><br>
              &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
              &#8211;Joseph Finder, <em>New York</em><em> Times Book </em>review 
              of <em>The Scorpion&#8217;s Gate</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Some of us have learned to listen when Richard A. Clarke 
              has something to say.&#160; Now Clarke comes with a novel that will 
              keep you awake at night&#8230;He demonstrates a flair for action 
              fiction.&#160; His almost three-decade background in intelligence 
              and counterterrorism serves him exceptionally well.&#160; </em><br>
              &#8211; Gary Hart, <em>Washington</em><em> Post</em> on Clarke and 
              <em>The Scorpion&#8217;s Gate</em><u></u></p>
<p>In his fiction debut, <em>The Scorpion&#8217;s Gate</em>, Richard 
              A. Clarke, former counterterrorism czar for Presidents Clinton and 
              George W. Bush, projected a world in 2010 in which the United States 
              and China were competing politically and economically for a dwindling 
              supply of increasingly expensive oil and gas.&#160; That competition 
              naturally took them to the Persian Gulf where the largest oil deposits 
              remained, where the United States was threatening Iran, and where 
              fundamentalist Islamic forces had emerged in Saudi Arabia.&#160; 
              Although not meant to be predictive, many of the trends in the novel 
              have developed and are dominating the news.&#160; Now Clarke creates 
              a scenario, set two years later, that is even more daring, controversial 
              and frighteningly real.&#160; </p>
<p>In <strong>BREAKPOINT </strong>(G.P. Putnam&#8217;s Sons; January 
              16, 2007; ISBN: 978-0-399-15378-5; $25.95) the #1 bestselling author 
              of <em>Against All Enemies</em> goes beyond the more familiar Middle 
              East geopolitical scenarios.&#160; Drawing on his years as Special 
              Adviser to the President for Cyberspace Security and his work as 
              Chairman of the President&#8217;s Critical Infrastructure Protection 
              Board, Clarke brings readers into a special world of knowledge and 
              inside information as he looks at present and future technology, 
              the web of communications that ties the earth together&#8212;and 
              how very, very easy it would be for a dedicated terrorist group 
              to throw the world into utter chaos.</p>
<p>The global village is an intricately intertwined network of technology 
              that has changed the way business is transacted, governments operate 
              and national defense is conducted.&#160; Binding together the world&#8217;s 
              economies, governments and communications it is large, vital and 
              extremely fragile.&#160; Now a sophisticated terrorist group is 
              seeking to &#8220;disconnect the globe.&#8221;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>The action in <strong>BREAKPOINT</strong> takes place over a 12-day 
              period and begins when a series of truck-bomb attacks in five U.S. 
              states and on both coasts destroys 10 obscure, unmanned and unprotected 
              beachheads&#8212;the nondescript, windowless shacks near the beaches 
              where transoceanic fiber-optic cables come ashore from Europe and 
              the Pacific and feed into Internet routers and switches.&#160; Whoever 
              the attackers are, the damage done to the international financial 
              system and U.S. diplomatic and military command control is immediate 
              and wide-ranging.&#160; Data and communications links between the 
              State Department and U.S. embassies in Europe, Africa, the Mideast 
              and South Asia are down.&#160; And more than half of U.S. military 
              forces overseas cannot fully carry out their missions because they 
              do not have unclassified Internet connectivity to the U.S.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>The major government agencies all lumber into action but behind 
              the scenes, the special projects office of the Intelligence Analysis 
              Center (IAC) knows that to catch unconventional terrorists requires 
              unconventional methods.&#160; A small team&#8212;smart, agile, and 
              quick&#8212;immediately starts to sift through a welter of often 
              contradictory information about right-wing militias, Russian organized 
              crime, Jihadist terrorists and enemy nation-states; chasing leads 
              all across the country and overseas.&#160; The FBI and Homeland 
              Security are looking for answers where the streetlights shine.&#160; 
              The IAC team goes into the shadows.&#160; </p>
<p>Computer grids, communications satellites, biotech firms soon come 
              under attack as the pace and scope of destruction increases.&#160; 
              Somebody has figured out an Achilles&#8217; heel in America&#8217;s 
              technology and national infrastructure, one obviously the government 
              itself had not recognized.&#160; Soon a breakpoint will be reached&#8212;and 
              then there may be nothing anybody can do.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>BREAKPOINT </strong>goes well beyond<strong> </strong>drawing 
              attention to the very real and very frightening vulnerabilities 
              of America&#8217;s critical infrastructure and the information systems 
              that are essential to our national and economic security.&#160; 
              The book is filled with the technology being developed right now 
              for a future just around the corner or in many cases already here&#8212;a 
              technology certain to cause enormous political, social, and economic 
              change.&#160;</p>

Even those at the working level within government operating groups are likely to ignore good ideas, but rather keep their focus on issues like 'how do we look to management three levels up?' and 'what's our PR look like?'.  Their contractors are also likely to be responsive to whims in the operating groups rather than insistent on innovative approaches, since their goals are driven by financial rather than idealogical concerns.
<br>
<br>
In a short story titled "Innerzones" (no URL's permitted here, so I can't link to it) a war using killer-replicators (nanotechnology) is on the brink of taking place, and it falls to innovators who have devised a defense system to choose to deploy it rather than waiting for the slow and indecisive actions of government.  It's that sort of intervention that may be necessary in situations where a solution is apparent, but no governmental authority will take a chance on putting it to work.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Back when I was a boy in the 1960s it was said by the "experts" that technology would shrink the work week and give us all a wonderful world to live in.  Those people were not stupid!  That potential existed just as they said it did.  Why did it not happen?  Because of the human tendancy toward ego!  Those with the tools to bring about such a social revolution decided (conciously or not) to use the power locked up in that gross product to better their own situation and as of now, leave the rest of us in developed countries a bit worse off than our parents.  Most of us value that social currency which tells us "I'm better than the rest".  That's what drives alot of our spending... get the newest thing so I can show it off to my friends.  This too will drive the application of the technologies spoken of here.  I can find no reason (wish I could) to suppose that those who are holding the purse strings will suddenly become interested in making a future for those less well off then they are.  I am no better of course!  How can I possibly sleep at night when I know of the suffering of people in Africa?  How can I go on living knowing that much of my wealth is purchased with human misery?  Well somehow I can.  I sleep very well at night though I am well aware of the worsening conditions around the 3rd world.  
<br>
My point?  When these technologies come on line, access will be granted only to those who can pay.  Their pride will immediately exclude most of us from gaining those benefits!  What happens when they don't need the rest of humanity?  Will they ignore us?  Will they see us as a threat?  Why should our own pride not cause us to be just that... a threat to them.  Surely we would hate them for excluding us!  These technologies will not be our undoing.  The Bible teaches that pride comes before a fall.  I believe that pride not technology may lead to our demise.  The singularity?  You all are pointing to the future but I believe we are at the event horizon now!  It's my opinion and I am PROUD of it!</p></td>

Economic Misinformation Plays a Major Role in French Election
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> It is important to understand that there is no economic logic to the argument that the citizens of any rich country need to reduce their living standards or government programs because of economic progress in developing countries. Once a developed country has reached a certain level of productivity, there is no economic reason for its residents to take a pay or benefit cut, or work more hours, because other countries are catching up to their level. That productivity, which is based on the country's collective knowledge, skills, capital stock, and organization of the economy, is still there, and in fact it increases every year. To the extent that international competition is being used by special interests to push down the living standards of French or German or U.S. workers -- and it is -- it just means that the rules for international commerce are being written by the wrong people. It is a problem of limited democracy and lack of representation for the majority, not a problem that is inherent to economic progress. </p></center>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>My Brother-in-Law grew up in Iran... For w ehile he was sucked into Fanatic Islamic Ideologies, and he was from a fairly well-to-do family.
<br>
<br>
Many of those involved in the perpetration of 9/11 were educated and not exactly ignorant or poor.
<br>
<br>
Radical Ideology comes about as a perception of lack of power and a fear of what those who are perceived as having power might do with even more of it. There is also the fact that Islam is currently undergoing their own reformation. They have yet to have a pivital point like Luther Nailing his 95 thesis to Wittenburg Cathedral in the 15th century.. Ooops... 16th century... It was 1546 (not important though really)...
<br>
<br>
What I am getting at is that currently Islam as a whole is feeling as if it is being threatened, and in a way it is.. Much of current science tends to threaten historical religion by exposing that it is still just myth that it is based upon and not really the historical actions of some savior or prophet. Unfortunately for those religions, they do not realize that a religion based upon a firm foundation of myth is much stronger than one which tries to base its creed/dogma and beliefs upon an actual historical event (but, again, this is getting off the subject a bit).
<br>
<br>
The threat that religion is undergoing is proucing a lot of fear, and those whose basic faith in the world is threatened tend to react in pretty irrational manners. Seeing as they have begun from an irrational belief in a superbeing based upon what they see as a factual history it is no surprise that they then move toward an irrational reaction to that percieved source of fear (teh threat).
<br>
<br>
This threat, in Islam, as I have been told by many erudite Muslims, is mostly manifest to the Islamic world by the US and its support of Israel, in conjunction with its continued support of education that is on the verge of creating godless technologies that are the works of Satan (in their eyes). Mostly it is the education more than it is the creation of thee godless technologies.
<br>
<br>
What they said most Muslims feared the most was the Internet and its ability to bring instant information to someone. Often information that contradicts what they have been taught as good little muslims... Basically, they fear the lifting of a veil of ignorance, because the lifting of that veil brings about a change in their world for which they had no clue as to ever have to prepare for... And change brings fear... always... Seems to always come back to that... Change and fear...</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Whenever you see a well-fed housecat idly killing a mouse in the garden, this is the last point of delineation between "evil" and bored animaldom practising what would be necessitated for survival in the wild. What exactly am I trying to say with this? Basically, benevolent singularity is the only chance for both collective redemption and species survival, simply because when a grown human first consciously murdered a human child with organized malevolence, that singular action of perhaps several hundred thousand years back went far beyond cats toying with mice; effectively "we" have long ago lost any claim to even our own existence, this adjudicated by the present daily carnage around this planet from preventable diseases, hunger, and war. It took some seven thousand years of settled agrarianism to reach this point-"this" being our small pockets of advancing civilization-and even now barely a quarter of the masses live comfortable fruitful lives. Given past indicators, I predict a looming period of fake singularity announcements coupled with all manner of false techno-messiahs punctuating the grinding neo-feudalism that even now lies on the social horizon, a time within which 10% of humanity will avoid yet rule the other 90% doomed to continued suffering during an indeterminate period between now and the only true hope: genuine singularity.  </p></td>

I view it in much the same manner that you described the cat playing with the mouse... It is just something that is going to hapen, and in the process, because of humanity being the way that humanity is (much the same way that cats are the way that cats are, adn as such , tend to jump on and "play" with small moving objects), many people will get hurt, killed, and otherwise damaged in the process.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully, much of this damage will be reparable by the very process that originaly caused said damage.

As I said in my post above... All of that depands upon the amount of fear that is created in society concerning said revolutions, whether they are pre- or post- singularity.</p></td>

Personally, I think that if they realized how AWFUL virgins were at sex... They might be less willing to give up their lives (That is mostly a joke, but I have found there to be some truth in it - I know of several people who swore they would never have sex again after loosing their virginity or after having been with someone who did)...
<br>
<br>
Still... The Islam is a culture that was born by the sword and grew by the sword... There HAVE been those who adopted Islam without having it forced upon them (I need to consult with my Islamic expert, but I know he has mentioned cultures that adopted it as a political ploy during the 9th through 12th centuries... Of course, they did so in order to gain military support from the Turks or Safavids to go beat on someone else...</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&#8220;Many of those involved in the perpetration of 9/11 were educated and not exactly ignorant or poor.&#8221; 
<br>
<br>
All of them were educated. That &#8216;poverty breeds terrorism&#8217; is a myth, propagated by jihadists and their left wing apologists, and dispelled time and time again as we learn more about the proponents of this barbaric, medieval ideology.
<br>
<br>
&#8220;Radical Ideology comes about as a perception of lack of power and a fear of what those who are perceived as having power might do with even more of it.&#8221;
<br>
<br>
&#8220;Radical&#8221;? Are we talking about Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism ..? No. We&#8217;re talking about Islam. &#8220;Radical Islam&#8221; then? No. Until we study the Quran and the stories and sayings of Mohammad (the Hadith) we will be under the illusion that Islam is a &#8216;religion of peace&#8217;. Nothing could be more further from the truth.
<br>
<br>
&#8220;Islam as a whole,&#8221; may as you said feel &#8220;as if it is being threatened&#8221; since Islam is a political and ideological project that was only disrupted in 1923 with the dissolution of the Islamic Caliphate in Ottoman Turkey after WW1: Western civil liberty and the growth of technology indeed threatens an ideology that would otherwise prescribe every detail of society in the most oppressive terms. 
<br>
<br>
And I am afraid you have been duped by &#8220; many erudite Muslims&#8221; that the cause is the &#8220;US and its support of Israel, in conjunction with its continued support of education that is on the verge of creating godless technologies&#8221;. America is the Great Satan, Israel the Little Satan: the former the champion of values anathema to Islam, the Complete and Total Explanation of the Universe and Regulator of Society; the latter the thorn in the side of the once great Islamic Empire that systematically persecuted the Jews until, as Mohummad said on his death bed, &#8220;there shall not be more than one religion on the [Saudi] peninsula&#8221;.
<br>
<br>
Until we learn more about Islam, and stop buying into the myth of Islamophobia, and understand that way before America was even conceived, there was jihad, there was sharia, there was oppression of non-Muslims (learn about the jizya, the treatment of the dhimmi), there was slavery, there was an expansionist, totalitarian political project &#8230; only then we might stop blaming ourselves, America, and Israel, and understand that the war we are in is not going to stop until Islam totally reforms or is utterly subdued.
<br>
<br>
This is the key lacking ingredient in all of Kurzweil&#8217;s analysis: a properly researched context in which we fight this war. It is not a War on Terror &#8211; it is a war on Jihadism. Read Waild Phares, Robert Spencer, Hugh Fitzgerald, Andrew Bostom, Bat Yeor &#8230; listen to Global Crisis Watch &#8230; This is the singular, specific war we are in and this will be the one that affects, limits, or stimulates breakthroughs in technology as we head toward the Singularity.</p></td>

Only, I think that the radicalizing of religion across the globe is part of the problem... Not just with Islam, but with ANY levantine monolithic monotheistic religion (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).
<br>
<br>
Islam is at the present the most visible of the wackos, and the most outspoken proponent of violence. Although, I believe that all three of the Yahweh cults are just as violent; just two of them are more hypocritical about their use of violence as a means to an end.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>singularity: Full reality regeneration becomes available.  It turns out 
<br>
technology was just something to give us beliefs about advancement.  A 
<br>
we with you achieve a point where we merge with the universe -- 
<br>
converting to nano-fog or whatever else we like.
<br>
<br>
<br>
a post-singularity city:
<br>
<br>
A whole country that decided to go against the people of Singularity 
<br>
decided to drop an hydrogen bomb on the most advanced of Singularity 
<br>
cities.
<br>
<br>
It is too late however, the majority of the population has merged and 
<br>
the bombs were taken apart within seconds of release from the aircraft 
<br>
by the large gray mass of nano fog hanging around the city.  
<br>
<br>
There was the attack in some universes, but most residents of the city 
<br>
aren't interested in hostile relations with the rest of the world and so never 
<br>
experienced it and continued to live in a peacefull world.
<br>
<br>
This was however an eventuality that was thought about by some members 
<br>
of the city in terms of what scripts to run in the case of such an 
<br>
eventuality.  
<br>
<br>
There will probably be a few city citizens that opted for a world 
<br>
of nuclear war to experience -- for a little while at least. There 
<br>
were some latch ditch efforts made by the city to allow newcomers to 
<br>
merge with the singularity.
<br>
<br>
A group of special ops come in from the attackers to check upon the 
<br>
damage in radiation suits.
<br>
<br>
Around the city floats a constant dome of nano-fog creating the 
<br>
impression of an "entrance" on some of the main streets. 
<br>
<br>
The spec-ops see no movement in the city, most of the cars having been 
<br>
adandoned -- perhaps long ago.  
<br>
<br>
As they approach Rodni notices it looks like there is a figure vaguely 
<br>
standing at the main intersection they are approaching.
<br>
<br>
Rodni alerts the group and they take cover.  The figures just continue 
<br>
to vaguely exist in the middle of the street, seeming relatively 
<br>
unthreatening -- creating a golden halo of light emiting from them in 
<br>
the sea of gray that is the nano-fog. 
<br>
<br>
Sam looks carefully and sees a small blonde girl in a red coat and hat 
<br>
standing amongst the figures -- it stirs vague recollection for him from 
<br>
childhood and he breaks formation to stumble towards the golden 
<br>
congregation.
<br>
<br>
Rodni to seems to see someone they are certain lived in the city they 
<br>
thought for sure were lost to the singularitarian uploaders.  In fact 
<br>
everyone in the group sees someone the recognize, break formation, and 
<br>
start mind-numbingly walking towards the group -- which is now casually 
<br>
beckoning them with motions, glances, fruits and toys.
<br>
<br>
Except Paul.  Paul was much of a loner much of his life and never really 
<br>
got along with his family or anyone for that matter -- most of Paul's 
<br>
existance is about the destruction of others,  Singularitarians are just 
<br>
the most prominent of targets.  The spec-ops let Paul on the team for 
<br>
his obvious ability and onemindedness about the issue.
<br>
<br>
Paul sees demons lurking in the golden green flames emiting from the 
<br>
main gates -- though occasionaly the images are swept over by a girl he 
<br>
once saw in childhood. This really torments Paul and he lets out a 
<br>
gutural yell as he retrieves his machine gun and starts firing in the 
<br>
direction of the people.
<br>
<br>
The girl in red notices and raises and eyebrow.  Two giants form 
<br>
seemingly from the two adjacent business towers -- which upon close 
<br>
inspection are seeping nano-fog, making the building seem almost alive. 
<br>
They giant/trolls have bodies of gray and carry each a gray shield  that 
<br>
is one with their arms -- the giant emerging from the right has a left 
<br>
arm shield, and the one from the left a right arm shield.  Though their 
<br>
size and apparent bulk seems like it would be slow moving, they have no 
<br>
trouble in getting between the explosive lazer bullets and the golden 
<br>
conglomerate. 
<br>
<br>
The whole spec ops faction gets really spooked, some hit the floor, some 
<br>
turn on Paul -- they were torn away from the silent communication stream 
<br>
that was going on between them and their loved ones of the golden 
<br>
conglomerate, to them it stopped with Pauls attack.
<br>
<br>
Rodni makes some statements about pursuing non-violent action, Sam 
<br>
agrees.  The leader, Flip checks that the giants with shields aren't 
<br>
advancing or threatening them in any matter -- makes a few value 
<br>
judments about the strength of the city and his crew -- turns to 
<br>
his crew and yells that it's just a reconissance mission and so they are not to engage in 
<br>
combat unless absolutely necessary. 
<br>
<br>
The giants on hearing this shrink into gray coloured Spartan phalanx 
<br>
soldiers. The right one speaks to Flip and asks if an ambassador should 
<br>
be sent for information exchange.  Flip concerned for his safety and 
<br>
that of the crew is relieved that they wont have to go much further, 
<br>
also feels empowered by the obvious gesture and respect of power that 
<br>
they gave him by asking.
<br>
<br>
Flip looks around his crew, sees Rodni nodding to him, Sam nodding while 
<br>
staring at the golden conglomerate and Paul walking around yelling 
<br>
something almost incoherantly while waving his arms about. The rest of 
<br>
the crew seem to be staring or hiding -- immobilized.  Slowly some fear 
<br>
starts to creep into him as he was getting over the shock of what just 
<br>
happened.
<br>
<br>
"Yes let the ambassador come!" yells Sam while stepping forward.  Paul 
<br>
moves his gun into position to take out Sam -- Sam believes Paul to have 
<br>
been taken over by the enemy.  There is a fly in Paul's ear and some 
<br>
dust on his scope though, he becomes obssesively interested in cleaning the 
<br>
lense, even decides to sit down.
<br>
<br>
Flip is standing biting his nails after having just seen his most 
<br>
dedicated blood thirsty man become tame.  Rodni, who was looking in a 
<br>
different direction at the time, makes eye contact with Flip and motions 
<br>
with his head towards the golden conglomerate, words come out of Rodni's 
<br>
mouth but Flip doesn't seem to hear them.  Rodni takes Flip by the 
<br>
shoulders and turns him around softly saying in Flips ear "Derz 
<br>
symuyn kyming".
<br>
<br>
Sam was up ahead of them kneeling down talking to the little girl in red 
<br>
which had come forward. He stood up, turned around and said "kymon 
<br>
gaiz, Lilim sez shill teik ys tu de Teacher". Flip started feeling 
<br>
nauseated and vomited in his suit.  "shi seiz dat iu dont hav tu uer ior 
<br>
sut."
<br>
<br>
Bob chirped up saying that the radiation levels were normal.  Sam 
<br>
started taking off his suit with he help of the little girl in red.
<br>
<br>
Rodni looked at the now nearly non-visible Flip through his visor.  "hir 
<br>
ai kan ynhuk iu."  It was getting brighter -- the walls of the buildings 
<br>
were starting to glow golden.  Flip spread his arms and turned around 
<br>
almost by reflex to let Rodni unzip him, Flip needed to think, this 
<br>
vomit wasn't helping.  
<br>
<br>
Once the crew saw their leaders taking off their suits they followed 
<br>
suit -- ;) ambiguity. 
<br>
<br>
Sam came up to Flip with a bunch of white hand-towels and handed them 
<br>
over.  "Thanks" said Flip cleaning himself.  Somehow that was really 
<br>
what Flip needed, his paranoia was gone, he felt comfortable 'ar de ualz 
<br>
glo,uing?' hi thought to himself while looking to the right building 
<br>
casually not taking note of the golden conglomerate.
<br>
<br>
He turned towards them and found himself with his crew,  mostly anyways 
<br>
-- he had a nagging feeling that someone was left behind but couldn't 
<br>
place it and the goldshine was really getting to him, so he really 
<br>
couldn't care less.
<br>
<br>
A figure in a black cloak stepped out of the golden conglomerate, took 
<br>
off its hood to reveal a stunningly pale complexing with golden flowing 
<br>
hair. It decided that a male homo-sapien appearance would be most easy 
<br>
to relate to with this crowd and took upon the appearance of one.
<br>
<br>
"Ai kan teik iu intu de Siti, byt ior maindz myst bi redi first." 
<br>
uttered the cloaked man.   Flip, Sam and Rodni nodded in agreement.  
<br>
Six arms extended out of the cloak all bearing familiar looking pipes. 
<br>
"iuv yl smoked marijuana before haven't you?".  Rodni game a smile and 
<br>
plucked his familiar decorated wooden pipe -- which he was certain he 
<br>
left at home but had seen enough things today he wasn't going to argue.  
<br>
He saw it was stuffed to the brim with what undoubtebly looked and 
<br>
smelled like high grade Cannabis Sativa. A pale hand held out a light 
<br>
and Rodni took a toke, closing his eyes in the nostalgic memory of the 
<br>
pipe.
<br>
<br>
"pylz ril fain .ui" Rodni said in the half-restrained voice of someone 
<br>
holding a hit for sensual extravagence and optimal effectiveness. 
<br>
<br>
The rest of the crew smiled and emulated the ritual. Stout Bob voiced up 
<br>
"do iu tink we kan have sym tcerz?"
<br>
<br>
"sirtenli" the man in the cloak motioned with a hand and the gaurds soon 
<br>
appeared with chairs retrieved from some of the nano-fog seeping out the 
<br>
buildings.  "hau abaut a tcendj in sineri?" hi waved and what was fog 
<br>
turned into lush plant life, a stream ran down the right side of the 
<br>
street.  
<br>
<br>
The golden conglomerate started mingling with their arrived familiars. A 
<br>
golden fountain sprang from where the golden conglomerate had been 
<br>
standing.  The man in the cloak leaned back and the fountain 
<br>
rock came to meet him and make him a comfortable seat. 
<br>
<br>
He saw that the majority of people were occupied with their familiars 
<br>
and so he had time to relax. 
<br>
<br>
The girl in red led Sam up to the fountain, tapped it and said "wine" a 
<br>
spout formed from the yellow rock of the fountain and started spewing 
<br>
wine, it was just dropping to the floor.  The girl motioned towards it.
<br>
<br>
"Perhaps a drinking vessle as well?" Sam said a little aghast at the 
<br>
obvious waste of the wine just flowing down the street and into the 
<br>
river.  A menu popped up infront of him, floating in mid air, it said: " 
<br>
drinking vessel,  Cancel,  Ok". Without even thinkng he clicked okay 
<br>
with his right hand and felt a cup in his left.
<br>
<br>
Paul awoke to notice that he had been drooling.  There was no one around 
<br>
him, some suits were scattered not far from where he was. 
<br>
<br>
He remmebered the Golden Conglomerate, looked up, and there it was, the 
<br>
monsters he had been seeing were still present, and that figure in the 
<br>
black cloak.  
<br>
<br>
It stepped out of the conglomerate and revealed itself.  It was a 
<br>
temptress, no wait it was just a man with long hair. The man extended 
<br>
his hand to reveal a new self heating pipe that Paul had been eyeing for 
<br>
some time -- packed to the brim. 
<br>
<br>
Paul felt for his weapon not really expecting to find them, and not. He 
<br>
looked towards the man who was outstretching a bottle of what clearly 
<br>
said "vitamin C -- reduces paranoia".  Paul found it a little odd, but 
<br>
had another glance at the monsters of the golden conglomerate and 
<br>
decided that perhaps he was somewhat paranoid. 
<br>
<br>
He took the bottle and looked suspiciously at the contents.  Then it hit 
<br>
him "Uer iz everyone!?". 
<br>
<br>
"they are in a happier universe, you can join them as soon as you are 
<br>
happy too" said the man waving and the holographic forms of the rest of 
<br>
the group dimly were aparent, playing with their familiars and 
<br>
experiencing the environment.
<br>
<br>
"they're in heaven,  I don't want to go there" Paul retorted. Lokam 
<br>
nodded.  
<br>
<br>
"Anything I can do for you in your hell universe?"
<br>
<br>
Paul pondered.  "Make me immortal and get me some slave broads" 
<br>
<br>
Lokam snapped his fingers, two shape shifters stepped out of the 
<br>
conglomerate. Lokam handed Paul the pipe with leather bag and a small 
<br>
pamphlet. 
<br>
<br>
"Eat the vitamins and smoke some pot to get closer to heaven, otherwise 
<br>
read the pamphlet for your immortality, the second page is a portal to 
<br>
la.ma'aSELtcan., it'll teach you LOJban and whatever else you want to 
<br>
know" Lokam paused.  "Hell is a free for all,  cities are full of high 
<br>
chaos creatures ready to consume.  You can take shelter for the night, 
<br>
but in the morning set out to your home base and tell them what you 
<br>
like, if you like -- it's a free for all, do as thou wilt and have fun! 
<br>
:D" and with that Lokam was gone.  The two shape shifters pressed 
<br>
close to their master and made him a shelter. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first page of the pamphlet: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164003/http://tcana.info/maheSELkik.asc" target="_blank">http://tcana.info/maheSELkik.asc</a>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Dude,
<br>
<br>
According to all of the info I have been able to gather about lojban... there are only about 50 people on earth who speak it...
<br>
<br>
Not to mention, it SUCKS ASS as a language to do anything but communicate precise instructions, and if I wanted to do that... I'll use a programming language.
<br>
<br>
No double entendr&#233;, no innuendo, no subtlety, no poetry, no methphor, no soul... Lojban may be an excellent langauge for removing all doubt as to the intent of a speaker, but that is why we have things called "questions"... To ask someone to clarify their intentions, and statements.
<br>
<br>
The adoption of lojban would be a nightmare of laziness. Communication skills would be lost, art would be lost....
<br>
<br>
I can definitely see the worlds languages thinning out to create a sort of "lingua franca" of the world (eventually, but I doubt that all of the people will really be speaking ONE language; it will just appear that way), but lojban??? 
<br>
<br>
I do not see a worldwide need for such a language. If one existed... I am not aware of it.
<br>
<br>
WTF is this obsession with lojban?</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Things like nanite-fogs don't get created in a vacuum. Odds are very likely that any pre-singularity society would know full well the futility of a direct intervention as clumsy and crude as "dropping a bomb".
<br>
<br>
Why would they not use their own nano-tech to produce some sort of weapon? Why would they not use some sort of disruptive energy weapon to disable the communications between computational nodes in the nanites (and between any other form of communications)? 
<br>
<br>
And Pot? Isn't that a bit crude as well... If you have access to the innermost workings of the mind (due to nanite 3D imaging of the molecular structure of the Brain, Central and Sympathetic Nervous Systems), why would you leave "Mind expansion" to a crude chemical that has not been tailored to the specific chemistry of each person? Not to mention that there are mechanisms beyond chemistry that could be used as well for "mind expansion". As if such a metaphor would even be applicable at that point.
<br>
<br>
All of these are just points that go to the basic features of the Singularity.
<br>
<br>
As has been pointed out below...
<br>
<br>
The whole point of the thing is that what exists beyond it is not predictable... It is an unknown....
<br>
<br>
You also seem to be trying to put anthropomorphic properties into what would be first and foremost a machine intelligence (i.e.: NON-human)..... </p></td>

We are also violating this principle every day we fail to get off this world and start exploring and colonizing new worlds. See ENTERING SPACE by Robert Zubrin for the details on this argument.

  The short sighted perspective that the current state of human suffering is somehow relevant to where the sigularity leads misses the entire point of the singularity: The idea that what happens on the other side of the event horizon is beyond or comprehension, the results may be total devastation for the human species, it may be the move into a utopian paradise but most likely is something we can not conceive of yet.
<br>
<br>
  All of our ego and positining will be irrelevant to a transhuministic entity, money and power are tools of egoist, but if the controlling entity is exponentially smarter than anyone else and is essentially egoless what would the actions of such an entity be? no-one can guess because its on the other side of the singularity.
