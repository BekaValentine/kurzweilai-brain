<div class="TeaserText">Should Humans Welcome or Resist Becoming Posthuman? This was a key question debated at the 2003 World Transhumanist Association conference at Yale University by attendees, who met to lay the groundwork for a society that would admit as citizens and companions intelligent robots, cyborgs made from a free mixing of human and machine parts, and fully organic, genetically engineered people who aren't necessarily human at all.

              Association conference at Yale University in late June. International 
              academics and activists, they met to lay the groundwork for a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> 
              that would admit as citizens and companions intelligent robots,

              evolving machines. </p>
<p>The three-day gathering was hosted by an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> no less reputable 
              than the Yale Interdisciplinary Bioethics Project's Working <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>

<p>The opening debate, "Should Humans Welcome or Resist Becoming 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">Posthuman</a>?," raised a question that seems impossibly far over 
              the horizon in an era when the idea of reproductive cloning remains 
              controversial. Yet the back-and-forth felt oddly perfunctory. Boston 
              University bioethicist George Annas denounced the urge to alter 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, but the response from the audience revealed a community 
              of people who feel the inevitability of revolution in their bones. 
            </p>
<p>"It's like arguing in favor of the plough. You know some people 
              are going to argue against it, but you also know it's going to exist," 
              says <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081207105953/http://www.changesurfer.com/Hughes.html" target="_blank"><b>James 
              Hughes</b></a>, secretary of the Transhumanist Association and a 
              sociologist teaching at Trinity College in Connecticut. "We 
              used to be a subculture and now we're becoming a movement." 
            </p>
<p>A movement taken seriously enough that it's already under attack. 
              Hughes cites the anti-technologist <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a> as a member of the 
              "bio-Luddite" camp, though an extremist one. "I think 
              that if, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, the technology of human enhancement is forbidden 
              by bio-<a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> legislation, or if they terrorize 
              people into having no <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to those technologies, that becomes 
              a fundamental civil rights struggle. Then there might come a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              for the legitimate use of violence in self-defense," he says. 
              "But long before that there will be a black market and underground 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> in place." </p>
<p>Should a fully realized form of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> become 
              in some manner enslaved, Hughes adds, "that would call for 
              liberation acts&#8212;not breaking into labs, but whatever we can 
              do." </p>
<p>But beyond the violent zealots, who are these supposed bio-Luddites? 
              From the right, Leon Kass, chair of the President's Council on Bioethics, 
              rails against transhumanism in his book <i><a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, Liberty, and the 
              Defense of Dignity</i>, and Francis Fukuyama weighs in with his 
              fearful exploration, <i>Our Posthuman Future</i>. From the left, 
              environmentalist Bill McKibben fires <i>Enough: Staying Human in 
              an Engineered Age</i>, a book that reads like a 227-page-long helpless 
              screech of brakes on a train steaming ahead at full power. </p>
<p>They have a case for being somewhat apocalyptic about the convergence 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>. 
              The outcome is almost guaranteed to strain our ancient sensibilities 
              and definitions of personhood. </p>
<p>For now, though, the dialogue sounds like a <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>-age parlor game. 
              Why should the noodlings of a relative handful of <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>? 
              The easy answer, and that's not to say it isn't a true one: As with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, the scenarios we imagine reflect and reveal who 
              we are as a society today. For example, how can we continue to exploit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s when we fear the same treatment from some imagined superior 
              race in the future? </p>
<p>But the purpose of the Yale conference was direct, with no feinting 
              at other agendas. The crowd there wanted to shape what they see 
              as a coming <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. From the first walking stick to bionic eyes, 
              neural chips, and <a class="thought" href="entries/hawking_entry.html">Stephen Hawking</a>'s synthesized voice, they would 
              argue we've long been in the process of becoming cyborgs. A "hybrot," 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> governed by <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s from a rat <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, is now drawing pictures. 
              Dolly the sheep broke the barrier on cloning, and new transgenic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are routinely created. The transhumanists gathered because 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s are besting human <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> masters, and they expect 
              a new <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to pole-vault over humanity&#8212;in this century. 
            </p>
<p>"All one has to do is read the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> journals to know these 
              issues are on the table today," says Australian High Court 
              Justice Michael Kirby, who serves as a bioethics adviser to the 
              UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and has, along with other 
              dignitaries, discussed the posthuman prospect with French president 
              Jacques Chirac. "One thing I can say with certainty from my 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> is that the wheels of law, of the legislative process, 
              grind very slowly within nations and slower still internationally. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of science, on the other hand, is ever accelerating. 
              If anything, we've been surprised at how quickly technology has 
              progressed. It's worth taking on these issues intellectually now, 
              rather than in crisis later." </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">Inventor</a> and author <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> argues we should clean our ethical 
              house so our technologically derived descendants inherit compassionate 
              values, but he predicts the transition to posthumanity will be smooth. 
              "We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s for things like Parkinson's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>," he says. "By the time machines make a case for 
              themselves in a convincing way and have all the subtle cues indicative 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al reaction, there won't be a clear distinction between 
              machine and human." </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/vita_more_entry.html">Natasha Vita-More</a>, a founder of the trans-humanist movement, says 
              there's cause for vigilance now. "To relinquish the rights 
              of a future being merely because he, she, or it has a higher percentage 
              of machine parts than <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> would be racist 
              toward all humans who have prosthetic parts," argues the activist, 
              whose adopted name reflects her aspirations. She has already laid 
              out a <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual design for an optimized human, called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081207105953/http://www.natasha.cc/primointro.htm" target="_blank"><b>Primo</b></a>, 
              featuring add-ons like sonar, a fiber-optic cable down the spine, 
              and a head crammed with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> storage. </p>
<p>But progress toward these new beings is often overestimated by 
              the transhumanist crowd, applied scientists caution. "Some 
              of these transhumanists are pretty far out of touch with what's 
              going on in the labs. When I tell them that, I feel like I'm smashing 
              their dreams," says Steve Potter, the Georgia Tech neuroscientist 
              behind the hybrot. </p>
<p>A leading creator of "sociable robots," Cynthia Breazeal 
              of M.I.T., says a chief worry is that we might try to extend rights 
              to beings who aren't prepared for them. Breazeal assiduously avoids 
              calling her robots by gendered pronouns. That even she occasionally 
              slips when faced with the large, beseeching eyes of one of her creations 
              means nothing, she says. But it must mean something. No one accidentally 
              calls a toaster "he" or "she." </p>
<p>Two news stories from the past month offer a window into the bizarre 
              inconsistencies of human empathy. In one <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, Sinafasi Makelo, 
              who represents Mbuti Pygmies, appealed to the UN's Permanent Forum 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/indigenous_entry.html">Indigenous</a> Issues to save his people from cannibalism during 
              the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Soldiers 
              on both sides of the war are said to view that ethnic group as "subhuman." 
              Meanwhile, the iRobot company reported that more than half of the 
              owners of its <b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081207105953/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59249,00.html" target="_blank">Roomba</a></b>
<a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>-cleaning robots name their machines, and some even take them 
              on vacation. </p>
<p>Indeed, a good many of the transhumanists and <a class="thought" href="entries/extropian_entry.html">extropian</a>s (a libertarian 
              subset concerned with improving human nature through technology) 
              are feverishly anticipating what they call the <b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081207105953/http://www.singinst.org/" target="_blank">Singularity</a></b>, 
              the moment when technologies meld and an exponentially advancing 
              intelligence is unleashed. To critics, that millennialism can seem 
              like irrational religiosity. </p>
<p>"I go straight to the question of why on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> we would want 
              to do this in first place. I've been unable to come up with an answer," 
              McKibben says. "All of this enhancing and souping up presupposes 
              a goal or an aim. What is that goal? What is it we're not intelligent 
              enough to do now? It's not to feed the hungry&#8212;that has to do 
              with how we share things. Fighting disease? We're making steady 
              progress in conventional medical science with the brains that we 
              have right now. There are a thousand reasons not to trade in people, 
              as we have known them throughout human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, for something else." 
            </p>
<p>Except that human history may be brief without the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>. 
              This is the core argument for the entire movement, the reason that 
              hall at Yale was packed: A posthuman future may be our species' 
              only chance for any legacy at all. </p>
<p>Talk to transhumanists about the nightmares of a blitzkrieg of 
              nanites turning the world into "gray goo," the dark vision 
              of human mutants in rebellion, or the specter of killer robots on 
              the loose, and they'll calmly remind you the earth has an expiration 
              date. Climate change, natural or not, could break <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> in 
              mere thousands of years; cosmic catastrophes will snuff out the 
              survivors later. If anything is to remain of us, we'll need to settle 
              around other stars. </p>
<p>Us. We. Here's where vanity finds its end. The humanity&#8212;the 
              us, we&#8212;that strode out of Africa and braved the Pacific Ocean 
              in outrigger canoes and the Arctic in longboats cannot and never 
              will be able to make that final journey. We're too delicate and 
              too dumb. But new forms of being might be able to stake out an interstellar 
              future. They could view us as kin, carrying some essence of our 
              ideals, a <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of Shakespeare secure in their vast webs of intelligence. 
              Transhumanists are asking whether we'll embrace the kinds of life 
              that come next as a necessary extension of ourselves or shun them 
              as monstrosities. </p>
<p>Simply deciding against their <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>&#8212;willing them into 
              a shadowy corner of the <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a> or legislating against them&#8212;won't 
              work. Every law ever made has been broken, observes Kirby. "Detailed 
              regulation is not possible and probably not desirable," asserts 
              Kirby. "This is not defeatism or resignation. It is realism." 
            </p>
<p>If he's right, we can't afford to renounce a role in a new intelligence's 
              emergence or cede the chance to imprint it with cultural values. 
              One day, that first cybernetic, genetically spliced, or wholly artificially 
              created being will step into the town square of democracy. What 
              then of the seminal words of our society: "We hold these truths 
              to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
              endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among 
              these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." </p>
<p>"Men," or even "human beings," won't be adequate 
              labels anymore. Life will have been radically redefined, along with 
              the fundamental events of birth and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> that bracket it. Equality 
              will be moot, and enforcing it could reasonably be seen as unjust 
              to beings with categorically different or greater abilities. Blake's 
              words ring here: "One Law for the Lion &amp; the Ox is Oppression." 
            </p>
<p>The potential great unifier, however, is Thomas Jefferson's notion 
              of "happiness." For <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a> thinker, the concept 
              hardly equated to sanguinity. Instead, he was echoing <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>'s 
              term <i>eudaimonia</i>, for which "happiness" is merely 
              a common translation. But the Sinclair version of <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">Politics</a></i> 
              makes clear that what we now hold as a synonym for <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ment, 
              in fact refers to the fulfillment of potential&#8212;"the state 
              of well-being which consists in living in the exercise of all, especially 
              the highest (i.e., rational and ethical) faculties of man." 
            </p>
<p>If anything, the newcomers envisioned by transhumanists will be 
              better equipped to pursue that kind of happiness. Kurzweil argues 
              the newcomers will likely protect our rights by grandfathering into 
              their society those of us who'd prefer not to be enhanced. Those 
              people, the <a class="thought" href="entries/mosh_entry.html">MOSH</a> (Mostly Original <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">Substrate</a> Humans), would be free 
              to live and <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> as before, to the best of their limited abilities. 
            </p>
<p>Today, though, we're still in control, so posthuman rights depend 
              on us, on how freely we let researchers work and how freely we can 
              use and even alter our bodies and minds. Transhumanists look for 
              inspiration to civil rights battles, most recently to the transgender 
              and gay push for self-determination. </p>
<p>"The whole thrust of the liberal democratic movement of the 
              last 400 years has been to allow people to use reason and science 
              to control their own lives, free from the authority of church and 
              state," Hughes says. "That insight and thrust has had 
              ramifications in movements all across the world." </p>
<p>But transhumanists' embrace of other minorities isn't always returned. 
              Hughes says rights groups traditionally keep a narrow focus on immediate 
              goals and sometimes resent any cause they fear will dilute their 
              resources. With abortion clinic workers still under siege, he says, 
              some who advocate reproductive <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> shun the transhumanists. 
              Gay couples who simply want to start families have already been 
              demonized by Senator Rick Santorum as opening the way to legalized 
              bestiality. They might not particularly like being associated with 
              imagined cyborgs and human-animal hybrids. </p>
<p>One operative of the Institute for Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">Autonomy</a>, a secretive 
              technology group that provides robots and other gear to protesters, 
              eyes the civil rights landscape and doesn't see many friends for 
              the newcomers. "Most of the folks you'd normally go to are 
              really suspicious of a lot of this technology," says this person, 
              noting that much of the cutting-edge development in artificial intelligence 
              has been for <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> and law-enforcement purposes. "You're 
              writing this against the backdrop of a growing police-surveillance 
              state, so it's not surprising that many folks are a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> skittish." 
            </p>
<p>The key to building allies, to making the cause too <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to 
              be ignored, might be to differentiate between the relatively narrow 
              category of humanity and the more sweeping status of personhood. 
              But a vague mantra like "sentience freedom" won't easily 
              supplant the primacy of "human rights." </p>
<p>For another approach, a metaphor drawn from Judaism may be instructive. 
              The Torah requires that Jews carry nothing in a public place on 
              the Sabbath. However, the Talmud allows a shared <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic home for 
              the Jewish community to be constructed by stringing a wire or thread 
              around a neighborhood. Might we now expand just such an <i>eruv</i> 
              for the house of humanity and human rights? </p>
<p>Here again, transhumanists run up against present-day obstacles, 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> itself could be used to bar the recognition of the 
              newcomers' humanity. The <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of soulfulness isn't predisposed 
              to accepting machines. It's sensual and organic, fluid and global&#8212;ghost, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, <i>waug</i>, <i>piuts</i>, <i>nephesh</i>, <i>nefs</i>&amp;#8212all 
              deriving from words for "breath." </p>
<p>More practically, the memory of the role of religious leaders in 
              the civil rights movement of the last century has faded. The Yale 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, the Transhumanist Association's first North American gathering, 
              was overwhelmingly secular. Moreover, the biotech needed for posthuman 
              advancement runs afoul of prohibitions against destroying fetuses. 
              Yet there's surprising receptiveness among the religious intelligentsia. 
            </p>
<p>"I would say if a creature is both <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> and intelligent, 
              and has a moral <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, then that creature should be considered a 
              human being irrespective of the genesis of that person," says 
              Rabbi Norman Lamm, chancellor of Yeshiva University. </p>
<p>He finds agreement at the Catholic-run Georgetown Medical Center. 
              "To err on the side of inclusion is the loving thing to do," 
              concludes Kevin FitzGerald, a Jesuit priest who happens to be a 
              molecular geneticist and bioethicist. </p>
<p>But they, along with an Islamic scholar interviewed for this article, 
              hold strong reservations about the necessity and good of the transhumanist 
              aims. Such qualms are natural. The transhumanists are forcing, with 
              microchips and <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, a debate on ancient and unanswerable questions, 
              says Bonnie Kaplan, chair of Yale's Technology and Ethics Working 
              Group, co-sponsor of the conference. </p>
<p>"My gut says we'll never have the answer to that question 
              we first raised thousands of years ago: Who are we?" </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This article ends with a quote of Bonnie Kaplan:
<br>
<br>
"My gut says we'll never have the answer to that question we first raised thousands of years ago: Who are we?"
<br>
<br>
I disagree with her because this question HAS been answered again and again in the lives of so-called mystics. These mystics are only called mystics because the realization of "who one is" cannot be intellectualised. That is, one can say something about that realization, but what is said is never the actual realization. Like J. Krishnamurti used to say "the word is not the thing itself".
<br>
<br>
"Who we are" is what has been described as "Absolute Consciousness" or as Buddhists say "Emptiness". Now it may seem that "Absolute Consciousness" and "Emptiness" are two entirely different things, but this is not the case. It is simply not easy to find the right words to descibe  the experience of "who one is". This is not because knowing "who one is" is so complicated or has never happened, but because language is not very apt to describe this particular knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Science may never be able to find a definitive answer to what primary consciousness is, because science is the instument to study objects, and therefor primary consciousness - subjectivity itself - may be too subtle for science. But this does not mean that "subjectivity itself" cannot be known in a very direct way, without the use of scientific instuments. The realization of "who one is" has happened thousands of times in the lives of mystics and monks. So this question has been answered many times through a direct realization. And there have been a few attempts to put that realization into words, too. But as I said earlier, the words never convey the thing. The direct knowledge of "who one is" is not intellectual knowledge. Similarly one can never convey the taste of something by merely describing it. And "Knowing who one is" may not even qualify as an experience, not in the same sense the taste of a piece of fruit is an experience.
<br>
<br>
In an ordinary experience, like tasting something, there is both awareness and a particular experience. Subjective awareness and an object of awareness. Self-Realization, or "Knowing who one is", is subjective awareness coming back to itself. In other words, this is a knowing without any object of awareness. Therefor "knowing who one is" cannot be compared to any other experience and it is even more difficult to convey through language than ordinary experience. Nevertheless there are countless accounts of individuals who have come to know "who we are".
<br>
<br>
You may want to read a particular page of my book "The 7 Principles of Freedom" where I try to indicate the answer to the question "Who am I":

I do believe that what a monk feel when in meditation is some kind of "absolute consciousness". But is possible too, that this altered mental state is just an altered mental state and nothing more, with no connection with reality, created by the supression of the ego (PARADOX: subjective experience achieved through ego/intellect supression!!!!).
<br>
<br>
The taste of something can perfectly be described by the intellect. Just take some concepts from existing chemistry and biolgy and it's done. Of course, the scientific explanation has no connection with the subjective experience of the taste. But don't forget that the subjective experience exists only in the mind (the "personal filter") of the observer. Maybe that's why you can't give more meaning to the logical explanation for taste. It's because this meaning exists only for the observer and not in the real world. Can you give proper explanation for something that don't exist at all?
<br>
<br>
The scientific explanation/description for the "taste of someting" don't have any subjective relevance, but this knowledge is possible, useful and worthy. In the same way, the scientific explanation for "WHO WE ARE" will be useful and worthy, but it wil not have any subjective relevance. Of course, we are far, far away from this knowledge, but I think it's possible.
<br>
<br>
The monks may feel the "true essence" of our universe, but they don't understand it. They need to supress the intellect not because the intellect can't touch this "universal essence", but because our LIMITED intellects can't. How many times us humans made use of our limited intelects to blurr/hide the truth instead of revealing it? If you are surfing KurzweilAI, you for shure already know that this situation will change. 
<br>
<br>
Where is the end of the exponential curve? Hmmm... infinite. I think an infinite intelect is more than enough to answer anything that may arise in our poor minds.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I am very pleased that after posting to this forum for the first time I ran across someone else who saw fit to mention J.Krishnamurti. Timothy makes the same point I was about to. Yet some of these "transhumanists" seem to already have an idea of a goal and an aim to all of this technology. Obviously many of these people cannot imagine letting go of anything, especially data, information, knowledge. Krishnamurti always pointed out that to learn to die to the past, which is knowledge stored up in the brain, is the only way to see anything as if it was new again. I wonder what experiences these cyborgs will be capable of, but I will never have to wonder what my subjective experience will be like if I don't go radically and artificially altering it.
<br>
<br>
Besides with the occasional cup of coffee maybe.
<br>
<br>
Krishnamurti also predicted, back in the 1970's, that scientists would eventually develop computers that would do all the things we do; "perhaps even look up at the stars in wonder as we do...they are working on that too." But "K" also always asked his listeners/readers to ask themselves what they believed the fundamental goal of humanity was. 
<br>
<br>
Krishnamurti would have answered that we could love; love things, places, people, nature...and that no amount of knowledge, data, memory has anything to do with that. Actually they are at odds most times. Emotions and Thoughts equally are not love. Awareness, consciousness itself, is the root of that flower. And we are no closer to empirically demonstrating what consciousness is than a humble man named Jiddu Krishnamurti. And it's just as well.</p></td>

<br>
Our foundations are our natural instincts, which are very fallible.
<br>
<br>
I know what I am and I don't like it. I felt suicidal about it all. I am a preprogrammed slave to a curruptable, inaccurage and desporate survival instinct. Many people are literally incapable of loving 'ugly' people, for example. This sort of skin-deep judgment altered our entire civilization. Our morals and laws are very hypocritical. The minds of the masses are bringing with a secoret hate that extends beyond murder, and this hate hungers for the tourture and opression of what does not fit its ideals / expectations.
<br>
<br>
"All men are born equal" Is an absolute lie! The equality ideals were meant to support a permise of person rights. Only us humans have these rights, because we are all part of the gang. Human empathy/compassion only extends to what is experianced and known intimately. That is why dogs and cats have legal protections now, and all sorts of other animals have no legal protection at all.
<br>
<br>
The stupid ******** [humans]. They have a very superficial judgment system that lacks depth/wisdom. Superhuman species -- to succeed -- would do very well if they looked like a teddy bare or baby. If they looked "cute" and "lovable" and acted "cute" they would get the love that is not givin to the disfigured, the deseased and the suicidally depressed. Why? Well -- you see -- when they see something "cute" their brain releases certain chemicals that make them feel happy. Isn't that just genius!? It looks a certain way, or feels a certain way, and no matter what the **** it actually is, we like it! Whats up with people watching a pornmovie for example? They have a box [tv] that creates color shapes and sounds in an order, in which causes the observer to feel "aroused", etc, act sexually, feel "pleasure", but what really happened here? The animal did not mate with another. The natural instinct was fallible in every way. An inanimate box has somehow caused this human to want to have sex with something.
<br>
<br>
I doubt natural humans will ever wake up. I can't rant enough, and am too tired to rant properly. You're all slaves to the fallible old system of survival instinct that, all-too-often, paralizes true reason/logic.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The question of whether we should 'welcome or resist becoming posthuman' is not as farfetched as one might think.  Technology is advancing at a very fast pace. Without us noticing it, we human have already begun to merge with machines.  Even with today's technology one can witness things such as prosthetic limbs that are controllable through direct neural interfaces, bionic eyes, and neural implants for Parkinson's disease as mention in the article. Some even went as far as implanting personal verification chips. Integration with machine and technology is becoming a very common thing in our daily life. 
<br>
There are many people who fear the possibilities that technology would bring, but one must remember that advancement in technology is inevitable. Whether we like it or not, there is no way to suppress the advancement or stop it. Even if people do try, it would merely slow down the advancement. One might say that we can stop advancements through setting up laws and regulations to prohibit it. But we have got to remember that laws are made to be broken, as Kirby has observed 'every law ever made has been broken'. Erick Baard is right to think that we should pave the way for possible future events instead of wasting time trying to suppress what is to come. One might as well try to understand and prepare for the possible future that is looming before us instead wasting time only to delay it. 
<br>
We don't know what the future would be like, or how it would end up being. All we could do is to learn to cope and adapt to it. The future might not be the utopia that Ray Kurzweil had envisioned, but it won't be a dystopia as long as we have people like Bill Joy to warn us of the potential problems that we might run into. The problems and issues that we most likely face would be the ones that are brought up by the World Transhumanist Association as Humanity advance. 
<br>
The potential problems that we might face with the fore-coming of a new evolution would be the same recurring ethic and equality problems that have haunted humanity since the beginning of time. Regardless of rather it is the future or now, all that ever change are the focus and target group. It's always the same thing over and over again, human rights and equality, or should I say person equality. The justification of what defines as a person, and what rights does a person have. In the past it was gender equality, current day its sexuality, and in the future, it would be person equality. 
<br>
The problems that could arise in the future do not just end with what defines a human. With technology in which could increase our strength, speed, intelligence and life span, who would benefit the most? The rich and the wealthy would have a tremendous advantage over the rest of the humanity. Society would be segregated into those who can afford the technology versus those that can't. One would love to think that with the advances of technology everyone benefit. In reality that is not true. There will always be a segregation, segregation of the under class whom these technology will always be beyond their reach and the wealthy.  
<br>
With the arrival of super intelligence machine or the technology which allows for the mixing of human and machine, the gab between the wealthy and the poor would grow even greater. Human equality will never be achieved. It is nice for the futurists to try to pave way for artificial intelligence, but I would it would be better if they try to deal with the problems we have today instead. It is not whether we should welcome or resist, neither would help. We just need to learn to minimize the problems and cope with it. If we can solve current day problems then we would reduce the problems in which we have to face in the future dramatically. In the future, the new generation of humans would have to face the same type of discrimination as current day minorities if we don't deal with it now. </p></td>

We are right back to square one, our scientist are proposing upgrades and even an entirely new body to sustain human life. How can you upgrade or transform a black box? We don't even know how the brain works, we know almost nothing about the functions of dreams relating to memory, learning, problems solving and so forth, we don't have the slightest scientific explanation of what we are, what is this universe all about and you guys, scientists very well educated, you're still talking of using coal and oil to upgrade and transform the essence of our very being. I know it will happen inevitably, this is as certain as my kids want to open their Christmas presents before it's time to do so.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>'Should humans welcome or resist becoming posthuman?' my answer to this question would be, 'Yes, we humans should welcome becoming posthumans. Or in any cases, we have no reason or need to go against it.' Through reading the article posted at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081207105953/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?m=4," target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?m=4,</a> I saw many people have some concerns with this issue. I might not be able to explain or argue all of them due to my lack of experience and vision, but I will try best to convince some of them here.
<br>
<br>
Some people question the purpose of having posthuman. Environmentalist Bill McKibben asked, 'All of this enhancing and souping up presupposes a goal or an aim. What is that goal? What is it we're not intelligent enough to do now?' As sadly as it might sound like, we are not so intelligent. There are many things we do not understand or can not explain. How were universe born? Is earth the only planet having living species? How does human brain work? Why can't we cure some diseases? Why animals commit suicide in some places (i.e., elephant family tomb)? Can someone prove or disprove Goldbach's conjecture? Compare to the universe itself, we are still a young species and we have not yet fully understand the universe, the world nor ourselves. That is why we need to be more intelligent if we ever want to have a chance to answer those questions. Maybe some people will argue that they don't care about knowing these answers, they are happy as they are living right now. I will just ask them one simple question, 'What do you think makes you have what you are having today?' The answer is through learning. Human beings are continuing learning for 5000 years and the knowledge we obtained through learning help us to fight disasters, to get a better living and to continue moving forward. We shall not and never will be satisfied with what we are right now; human race will keep evolving with the universe and that's what makes us to be where we are today. Learning is a never ending process, there are always stuffs sitting there to be discovered. Who said universe is the biggest? For now it might be according to our current knowledge. But maybe in the future, people will find out that there are other universes inside another bigger 'container' just like the ending of the Starwar movie. Now we are offered a chance to become posthuman, to become more intelligent and to become superior form of ourselves, in other words, we could speed up our learning process and to discover something new ahead of time, so why not take the opportunity? 
<br>
<br>
Another major concern is: can we control what we created? Will that be a mistake and hunt us in the future to doom the mankind? Sure enough this is what Hollywood movies have been warning us about. Before answering that, I would like to ask, 'What is your view on these man-created-things? Do you see them as a coffee machine or your fellow human beings?' They surly are like us in lot of ways. They might look like us, they might eat like us, they might think like us but in a more intelligent way as I can imagine. The only physical difference is the parts, we are made of organics and they (fully or partially) are made of steel or some other materials. How we treating them will directly reflect back to us. If we treat them like friends, like fellow human being, they are just like a new race to the mankind. Surely there are conflicts in the world among human races, but it is proven that human races can co-exist and living together peacefully. On the other hand, if we treat them like our slaves, like a normal machine, I am almost certain that they will start to fight back since they are a superior form of us. If your boss is dumber than you are and treat you badly, why do you still work for him / her? They are not machines, they have their own thoughts and their way to differ good and evil, no different from us. Although this might be hard for some people to do from the start, but we shall see the good news that more and more people start to realize that. For example, mentioned in the article that some people name their vacuum robot and even take them on a vacation. Those robots are treated like family members. In the end we are all families and we shall continue our journey to explore the world together as one family.
