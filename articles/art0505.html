<div class="TeaserText">The idea that there are large-scale trends in the evolution of biological organisms, such as increasing complexity, is highly controversial. But Peter Turney presents a simple computational model showing that local adaptation to a dynamic, randomly changing environment results in a global trend towards increasing evolutionary versatility, which implies an accelerating evolutionary pace, and that this trend can continue without bound if there is sufficient ongoing change in the environment.

<br> <h1>Abstract </h1>
<p>The idea that there are any large-scale trends in the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s is highly controversial. It is commonly 
              believed, for example, that there is a large-scale trend in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, but empirical and theoretical arguments 
              undermine this belief. Natural selection results in <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s that 
              are well adapted to their local environments, but it is not clear 
              how local adaptation can produce a global trend. In this paper, 
              I present a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al model, in which local adaptation 
              to a randomly changing environment results in a global trend towards 
              increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. In this model, for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility to increase without bound, the environment must be highly 
              dynamic. The model also shows that unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              implies an accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary pace. I believe that unbounded 
              increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility is a large-scale trend in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. 
              I discuss some of the testable predictions about <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              that are suggested by the model.</p>
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Ruse argues that almost all <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary theorists (before, after, 
              and including Darwin) believe that there is <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              [26]. <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> implies that there is a large-scale trend and that 
              the trend is good [4, 5]. For example, it is commonly believed by 
              the layperson that there is a large-scale trend in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> towards 
              increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and that this trend is good. Several scientists 
              have suggested that we should focus on the (scientific) question 
              of whether there are any large-scale trends, without regard to the 
              (non-scientific) question of whether such trends are good [4, 5, 
              21, 22]. McShea presents an excellent survey of eight serious candidates 
              (&#8220;live hypotheses&#8221;) for large-scale trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>: 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> intensiveness, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility, developmental 
              depth, structural depth, adaptedness, size, and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> [21]. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">Complexity</a> appears to be the most popular candidate.</p>
<p>The standard <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion to large-scale trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is that 
              natural selection is a local process that results in <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s that 
              are well adapted to their local environments, and there is no way 
              for this local mechanism to yield a global trend. On the other hand, 
              it does seem that <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> (for example) has increased steadily 
              since <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> began. This seems to suggest that natural selection 
              favours increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. However, many <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary theorists 
              deny that there is any driving force, such as natural selection, 
              behind any of the apparent large-scale trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>Gould has presented the most extensive arguments against a driving 
              force [16, 17]. Gould admits that there may be large-scale trends 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but he argues that any such trends are, in essence, 
              statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s. For example, if we consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> since the first appearance of <a class="thought" href="entries/prokaryote_entry.html">prokaryote</a>s, the mean level 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> would necessarily increase with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, because any 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> with significantly less <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> than a <a class="thought" href="entries/prokaryote_entry.html">prokaryote</a> would 
              not be able to live [16, 17]. According to Gould, the apparent trend 
              towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>- plexity is due to random variation in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
              plus the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of a minimum level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> required to 
              sustain life; there is no selective pressure that drives <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> towards 
              increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. I discuss Gould&#8217;s arguments in more 
              detail in Section 2.</p>
<p>Of the eight live hypotheses for large-scale trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
              this paper focuses on <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. I believe that there 
              is indeed a selective advantage to increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary versatility is the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of independent dimensions 
              along which variation can occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> [21, 25, 34, 35, 36, 
              37]. It is possible that increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility may 
              be the driving force behind other apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary trends, 
              such as increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. I discuss the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility in Section 3.</p>
<p>In Section 4, I introduce a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al model of unbounded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. As far as I know, this is the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              model of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary mechanism for one of the eight live hypotheses 
              for large-scale trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. In this model, the population 
              evolves in a series of eras. During each era, the fitness landscape 
              is constant, but it randomly changes from one era to the next era. 
              The model shows that there is a long-term trend towards increasing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility, in spite of the random drift of the fitness 
              landscape. In fact, when the fitness landscape is constant, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility is bounded. In this model, unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              requires a dynamic fitness landscape. The point of this model is 
              to show that it is possible, in principle, for natural selection 
              to drive <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> towards globally increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility, 
              without bound, even though natural selection is a purely local process.</p>
<p>I discuss some related work in Section 5. My simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              model of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility is related to Bedau and Seymour&#8217;s 
              model of the adaptation of mutation rates [8]. The primary focus 
              of Bedau and Seymour was the adaptation of mutation rates, but the 
              primary focus of this paper is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. Bedau and 
              Seymour&#8217;s model does not address <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility.</p>
<p>The core of this paper is the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al evaluation of the model, 
              in Section 6. In the first two <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s, I show that there are 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings for which <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility can increase 
              indefinitely. In the third <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, I show that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility is bounded when the fitness landscape is static. In 
              the remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s, I examine a wide range of settings for 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s in the model. These <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s show that the behaviour 
              of the model is primarily determined by the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s that control 
              the amount of change in the fitness landscape.</p>
<p>In Section 7, I discuss the implications of the model. One of the 
              most interesting implications of the model is that increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility implies an accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary pace. This leads 
              to testable predictions about <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>I discuss limitations and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> work in Section 8 and I conclude 
              in Section 9.</p>
<h1>2. Arguments Against Large-Scale Trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a></h1>
<p>Natural selection produces <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s that are well adapted to their 
              local environments. The major <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion to large-scale trends in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is that there is no way for local adaptation to cause 
              a large-scale trend [16, 17, 22]. For example, although the environments 
              of primates may favour increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, the environments of 
              most parasites favour streamlining and simplification [17]. There 
              is no generally accepted theoretical explanation of how natural 
              selection could cause a large-scale trend. Van Valen&#8217;s Red 
              Queen <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> [33] attempts to explain how natural selection 
              could cause a trend towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> (based on coevolution), 
              although Van Valen&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> has been criticized [19, 23]. 
              In this paper, I propose an explanation of how natural selection 
              could cause a trend towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. 
              Attractive features of my proposal are that it can easily be simulated 
              on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and that it leads to testable (in principle) predictions.</p>
<p>If there were some constant property, shared by all environments, 
              then it would be easy to see how there could be a large-scale trend, 
              due to long-term adaptation to this constant property. However, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al model in Section 4 shows that there can be a large-scale 
              trend even when the fitness landscape changes completely randomly 
              over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from theoretical difficulties with large-scale trends, there 
              is the question of whether there is empirical evidence for any large-scale 
              trend. McShea&#8217;s survey of candidates for large-scale trends 
              does not address the issue of evidence for the candidates [21], 
              but, in another paper, he finds that there is no solid evidence 
              for a trend in most kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> [20].</p>
<p>Gould argues that, even if there were empirical evidence for a 
              large-scale trend, that does not imply that there is a driving force 
              behind the trend [16, 17]. Gould argues that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is performing 
              a random walk in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, but there is a <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a> on 
              the minimum level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> 
              drops below a certain level (e.g., the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/prokaryote_entry.html">prokaryote</a>s), it 
              can no longer live. Gould&#8217;s metaphor is that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is a 
              drunkard&#8217;s random walk, but with a wall in the way (i.e., a 
              bounded diffusion process). This wall of minimum <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> causes 
              random drift towards higher <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. This random drift does not 
              involve any active selection for <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>; there is no push or 
              drive towards increased <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, (1) it is not clear how local selection can produce 
              a global trend and (2) observation of a global trend does not imply 
              that there is a driving force behind the trend. However, (1) my 
              model shows one way in which local selection can produce a global 
              trend and (2) the model makes testable (in principle) predictions.</p>
<h1>3. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary Versatility</h1>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary versatility is the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of independent dimensions 
              along which variation can occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> [21, 25, 34, 35, 36, 
              37]. A <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> with high <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility has a wide range 
              of ways in which it can adapt to its environment. Vermeij has argued 
              that there should be selection for increased <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility, 
              because it can lead to <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s that are more efficient and better 
              at exploiting their environments [34, 35, 36, 37].</p>
<p>An <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant point is that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility requires not 
              merely many dimensions along which variation can occur, but also 
              that the dimensions should be independent. Pleiot- ropy is the condition 
              in which a single gene affects two or more distinct traits that 
              appear to be unrelated. When N traits, which appear to vary on N 
              dimensions, are linked by pleiotropy, there is effectively only 
              one dimension along which variation can occur. Several authors have 
              suggested that it would be beneficial for the <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> 
              map to be modular, since increasing modularity implies increasing 
              independence of traits [2, 27, 30, 38]. McShea points out the close 
              connection between <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility and modularity [21].</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary versatility seems to be connected to several of the 
              seven other &#8220;live hypotheses&#8221; [21]. Increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility implies increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, since the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s must 
              have some new physical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s to support each new dimension 
              of variation. The dimensions are supposed to be independent, so 
              the new physical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s must also be (at least partially) independent. 
              The increasing accumulation of many independent new physical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              implies increasingly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s. Among the other live hypotheses, 
              developmental depth, structural depth, adaptedness, and perhaps 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> intensiveness may be connected to <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              [21].</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary versatility also seems to be related to evolvability 
              [1, 2, 12, 13, 32, 38]. Evolvability is the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to evolve [12, 
              13]. An increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of independent dimensions along which 
              variation can occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> implies an increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              to evolve, so it would seem that any increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              must also be an increase in evolvability. On the other hand, some 
              properties that increase evolvability may decrease <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility. For example, selection can be expected to favour a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a> that produces symmetrical left-right development [12, 
              13]. For humans, if a sixth finger were a useful mutation, then 
              it would likely be best if the new fingers appeared simultaneously 
              on both hands, instead of requiring two separate mutations, one 
              for the left hand and another for the right hand. In general, selection 
              should favour any <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a> that produces adaptive covariation 
              [24]. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s increase evolvability, but they appear to 
              decrease <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility [21].</p>
<p>Increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility suggests an increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of independent dimensions, but adaptive covariation suggests a decreasing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of independent dimensions. Vermeij reconciles these forces 
              by proposing that increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility adds more 
              dimensions, which are then integrated by adaptive covariation, so 
              that new dimensions are added and integrated in an ongoing cycle 
              [21, 37].</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary versatility also appears to be related to the Baldwin 
              effect [3, 18, 31]. The Baldwin effect is based on phenotypic plasticity, 
              the ability of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> (the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>) to adapt to its local 
              environment, during its lifetime. Examples of phenotypic plasticity 
              include the ability of humans to tan on exposure to sunlight and 
              the ability of many <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s to learn from <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. Phenotypic 
              plasticity can facilitate <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by enabling an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> to benefit 
              from (or at least survive) a partially successful mutation, which 
              otherwise (in the absence of phenotypic plasticity) might be detrimental. 
              This gives <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> the opportunity to complete the partially successful 
              mutation in <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> is not really free to vary along a given dimension if 
              all variation along that dimension leads to <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> without children. 
              Thus phenotypic plasticity increases the effective <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of dimensions 
              along which variation can occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. The Baldwin effect 
              can therefore be seen as a mechanism for increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility.</p>
<h1>4. A Simple <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al Model of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary Versatility</h1>
<p>The following simple model of unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              has three <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant features: (1) The fitness function is based 
              on a shifting target, to demonstrate that a large-scale trend is 
              possible, even when the optimal <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> varies with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. In fact, 
              in this model, the target must shift, if the model is to display 
              unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. (2) The length of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              can change. There is no upper limit on the possible length of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. This is necessary, because if the length were bounded, then 
              there would be a finite <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>s, and thus there 
              would be a bound on the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. (3) The mutation 
              rate is encoded in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, so that the mutation rate can adapt 
              to the environment. This allows the model to address the claim that 
              mutation becomes increasingly harmful as the length of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              increases. Some authors have argued that natural selection should 
              tend to drive mutation rates to zero [42]. Of course, if the mutation 
              rate goes to zero, this sets a bound on <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s of the model and their baseline values. 
              In the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s that follow, I manipulate these <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s to 
              determine their effects on the behaviour of the model. The meaning 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s in Table 1 should become clear as I describe the 
              model.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:openImage('images/turney_table_1.gif', 679, 248)">Table 
              1</a></p>
<p>Figure 1 is a pseudo-<a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> description of the model of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility. In this model, a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is a string of bits. The model 
              is a steady-state <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a> (as opposed to a generational 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>), in which children are born one-at-a-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> [28, 
              29, 39, 40]. (In a generational <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>, the whole population 
              is updated simultaneously, resulting in a sequence of distinct generations.) 
              Parents are selected using tournament selection [9, 10]. In tournament 
              selection, the population is randomly sampled and the two fittest 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s in the sample are chosen to be parents (see lines 15 
              to 17 in Figure 1). The selective pressure can be controlled by 
              varying the size of the sample (TOURNAMENT_SIZE). A new child is 
              created by applying single-point crossover to the parents encoded 
              in the child&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> (lines 22 to 28). Mutation can flip a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> or it can add or 
              delete a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>, making the <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> string longer or shorter.</p>
<p>The initial section of a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> (the first MUTATION_CODE_LENGTH 
              bits) encodes the mutation rate for that <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. The remainder of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> (which may be null) encodes the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> 
              is a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> string, created from the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> by simply copying the bits 
              from the <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>, beginning with the MUTATION_CODE_LENGTH plus 
              one <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a> and continuing to the end of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>. 
              If the length of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is exactly MUTATION_CODE_LENGTH (as 
              it is when the simulation first starts running), then the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> 
              is the null string.</p>
<p>The fitness of the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> is determined by comparing it to a 
              target. The target is a random string of bits. The fitness of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> is the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of matching bits between the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> and 
              the target (lines 31 to 33). If the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> is null, the fitness 
              is zero. The length of the target grows, so that the target is always 
              at least as long as the longest <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> in the population (lines 
              29 to 30). When a new child is born, if it is fitter than the least 
              fit <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> in the population, then it replaces the least fit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> (lines 34 to 36).</p>
<p>The target is held constant for an interval of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> called an era. 
              At the end of an era, the target is randomly changed. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              the target changes, it is necessary to re-evaluate the fitness of 
              every <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> (lines 37 to 40). Instead of dividing a run into 
              a series of eras, the model could have been designed to have a small, 
              continuous change of the target for each new child that is born. 
              (This is a special case of the current model, where TARGET_CHANGE_RATE 
              is small and ERA_LENGTH is one.) The main motivation for dividing 
              the run into a series of eras is to increase the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al efficiency 
              of the model, since it is <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally expensive to re-evaluate 
              the fitness of every <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a new child is born. (Actually, 
              it would only really be necessary to re-evaluate TOURNAMENT_SIZE 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a new child is born.) It could also be argued 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is characterized by periods of stasis 
              followed by rapid change (e.g., punctuated equilibria), so this 
              feature of the model makes it more realistic.</p>

<p>Recall that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility is the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of independent 
              dimensions along which variation can occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. In this 
              model, the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility of a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is the length of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> minus MUTATION_CODE_LENGTH. This is the length of the 
              part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> that encodes the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>. The first MUTATION_CODE_LENGTH 
              bits are not independent and they do not directly affect the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>, 
              so I shall ignore them when counting the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of independent dimensions 
              along which variation can occur. Each remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              is an independent dimension along which variation can occur. The 
              dimensions are independent because the fitness of the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> is 
              defined as the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of matches between the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> and the target; 
              that is, the fitness is the sum of the fitnesses for each dimension. 
              Fitness on one dimension (a match on one <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>) has no impact on fitness 
              on another dimension (a match on another <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>).</p>
<p>Note that increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility (i.e., increasing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length) does not necessarily imply increasing fitness, because 
              (1) the additional bits do not necessarily match the target and 
              (2) a mutation rate that enables <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility (<a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              length) to increase also makes the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> vulnerable to disruptive 
              (fitness reducing) mutations. However, the design of the model implies 
              that increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length will tend to be correlated with increasing 
              fitness.</p>
<h1>5. Related Models</h1>
<p>The most closely related work is the model of Bedau and Seymour 
              [8]. In Bedau and Seymour&#8217;s model, mutation rates are allowed 
              to adapt to the demands of the environment. They find that mutation 
              rates adapt to an optimal level, which depends on the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              demands of the environment for novelty. My model is similar, in 
              that mutation rates are also allowed to adapt. Other work with adaptive 
              mutation rates includes [6, 11, 14, 41]. Bedau and Seymour&#8217;s 
              model and my model are distinct from this other work in that we 
              share an interest in the relationship between the adaptive mutation 
              rates and the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary demands of the environment for novelty.</p>
<p>The main difference between this paper and previous work is the 
              different <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive. None of the previous papers were concerned 
              with large-scale trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. As far as I know, this is 
              the first model to show how it is possible for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              to increase without bound.</p>
<h1>6. Results of <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a>s with the Model</h1>
<p>This section presents eight <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s with the model of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> examines the behaviour of the 
              model with the baseline <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings. The second <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> 
              runs the model for ten million births, but is otherwise the same 
              as the baseline case. This <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> gives a lower resolution view 
              of the behaviour of the model, but over a much longer <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scale. 
              These two <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s support the claim that the model can display 
              unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility, given suitable <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings. 
              The third <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> uses the baseline <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings, except 
              that the target is held constant. With a constant target, the mutation 
              rate eventually goes to zero and the population becomes static. 
              The results show that, in this model, unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              requires a dynamically varying target. The remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              vary the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s of the model, one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. These <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              show that the model is most sensitive to the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s that determine 
              the pace of change in the target. In comparison, the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s 
              that do not affect the target have relatively little influence on 
              the large-scale behaviour of the model.</p>
<h2>6.1 <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a> 1: Baseline <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">Parameter</a> Values</h2>
<p>Figure 2 shows the results with the baseline <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings 
              (see Table 1). Since the model is <a class="thought" href="entries/stochastic_entry.html">stochastic</a>, each run is different 
              (assuming the random <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> seed is different), but the general 
              behaviour is the same for all runs (assuming the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s are 
              the same). In this <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, I ran the model 100 times and averaged 
              the results across the 100 runs.</p>
<p>For this <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, the length of an era is 100 children. At the 
              start of each new era, the fitness drops. However, the overall trend 
              is towards increasing fitness (see the first plot in Figure 2). 
              Although the probability that a mutation will increase the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              length is equal to the probability that a mutation will decrease 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length, there is a steady trend towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              length (the second plot in Figure 2). The mutation rate decreases 
              steadily (third plot). Although the length of an era is fixed, in 
              each era, the increase in fitness since the start of the era is 
              greater than the corresponding increase for the previous era (fourth 
              plot). This shows that the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is accelerating.</p>

<h2>6.2 <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a> 2: Longer Run Length</h2>
<p>The steady decrease in the mutation rate in the first <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> 
              suggests that the mutation rate might go to zero. If the mutation 
              rate is zero, then the fitness can no longer increase without bound. 
              The fitness would vary randomly up and down as the target changed 
              each era, but the fitness would always be less than the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length, 
              which would become a constant value.</p>
<p>In the second <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, I ran the model until 10,000,000 children 
              were born (RUN_LENGTH = 10,000,000), in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to see whether the 
              trends in Figure 2 would continue over a longer <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scale. I ran 
              the model 10 times and averaged the results across the 10 runs. 
              In the first <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, the population averages (for fitness, <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              length, mutation rate, and fitness increase) were calculated each 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a new child was born. In the second <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, to increase 
              the speed of the model, the population averages were only calculated 
              each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 10,000 children were born. Figure 3 shows the results 
              for the second <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows that the trends in Figure 2 continue, in spite of 
              the much longer <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scale. The only exception is the mutation rate, 
              which quickly falls from its initial value of 0.5 to hover between 
              0.03 and 0.05. There is no indication that the mutation rate will 
              go to zero. However, since the model is <a class="thought" href="entries/stochastic_entry.html">stochastic</a>, there is always 
              a very small (but non-zero) probability that the mutation rate could 
              go to zero.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, the fitness increase is calculated as the average 
              fitness of the population at the end of an era minus the average 
              fitness of the population at the start of the same era. The fitness 
              increase is calculated each era and then the average fitness increase 
              is calculated for each 10,000 births. Since there are 100 births 
              in an era, there are 100 eras in each sample of 10,000 births, so 
              each value in the plot of the fitness increase is the average of 
              100 eras and 10 runs. The values in the other three plots (fitness, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length, and mutation rate) are averages over 10 runs.</p>

<h2>6.3 <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a> 3: Static Target</h2>
<p>This <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> investigated the behaviour of the model when the 
              target was static. As in the second <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, the population averages 
              for fitness, <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length, and mutation rate were calculated once 
              every 10,000 births. I ran the model 10 times and averaged the results 
              across the 10 runs. I used the baseline <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings, except 
              for RUN_LENGTH, ERA_LENGTH, and TARGET_CHANGE_RATE. I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> both RUN_LENGTH 
              and ERA_LENGTH to 10,000,000 and I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> TARGET_CHANGE_RATE to zero. 
              Figure 4 shows the results of the runs. In all 10 runs, the mutation 
              rate was zero, for every member of the population, long before 10,000,000 
              children were born. The longest run lasted for 349,000 births, the 
              shortest run lasted for 37,100 births, and the average run lasted 
              for 165,300 births. In comparison, in the second <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, all 
              10 runs ran for 10,000,000 children, with no sign that the mutation 
              rate would ever reach zero. These <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s support the claim 
              that (in this model) unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility requires 
              a dynamic target. The following two <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s investigate the 
              amount of change in the target that is needed to ensure unbounded 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility.</p>
<h2>6.4 <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a> 4: Varying Rate of Change of Target</h2>
<p>In the fourth <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, the rate of change of the target was 
              varied from 0.0 to 0.2. The RUN_LENGTH was constant at 1,000,000. 
              The remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s were <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to their baseline values. Figure 
              5 shows the behaviour of the model, averaged over ten separate runs. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the birth of the last <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> child (i.e., the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at 
              which the mutation rate becomes zero for every member of the population) 
              was around the birth of the 100,000th child when TARGET_CHANGE_RATE 
              was 0.0, but it quickly rose to around the 1,000,000th child as 
              TARGET_CHANGE_RATE approached 0.1 (see the first plot in Figure 
              5). It could not go past 1,000,000, because RUN_LENGTH was 1,000,000. 
              I conjecture that there is a threshold for TARGET_CHANGE_RATE at 
              approximately 0.1, where the average <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of birth of the last <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> 
              child approaches <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a> as RUN_LENGTH approaches <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>.</p>
<p>When TARGET_CHANGE_RATE was 0.08, 40% of the ten runs made it all 
              the way to the 1,000,000th birth with a mutation rate above zero. 
              When the TARGET_CHANGE_RATE was 0.1, this went to 90% (second plot 
              in Figure 5). The average fitness of the population at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              of the birth of the 1,000,000th child (the final fitness) rose steadily 
              as TARGET_CHANGE_RATE increased from 0.0 to 0.1 (third plot). Above 
              0.1, it could not rise significantly, because of the limit <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> by 
              RUN_LENGTH. I conjecture that it would rise to infin- ity as RUN_LENGTH 
              rises to <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>. The average mutation rate of the population at 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the birth of the 1,000,000th child (the final mutation 
              rate) increased steadily as TARGET_CHANGE_RATE increased, even past 
              the 0.1 threshold.</p>

              (ERA_LENGTH = 100), the target must change by at least 10% (TARGET_CHANGE_RATE

              rate eventually drops to zero.</p>

              to 1000. The RUN_LENGTH was constant at 1,000,000. The remaining

              to 1000. The baseline value for TOURNAMENT_SIZE was 400. Larger 
              tournaments mean that there is more competition to become a parent, 
              so there is higher selective pressure. The RUN_LENGTH was constant 
              at 1,000,000 and the remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s were <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to their baseline

<p>When the population is small, the model is more susceptible to 
              random variations. With a large population, the model will tend 
              to behave the same way, every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it runs. Figure 8 suggests that 
              the model becomes unstable when the population size is less than 
              about 2000, although there is no sharp boundary at 2000. This is 
              unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a> 4, where there is a sharp boundary when TARGET_CHANGE_RATE 
              is 0.1, and <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a> 5, where there is a sharp boundary when ERA_LENGTH

<h1>7. Implications of the Model</h1>
<p>I do not claim that the model shows that there is a large-scale 
              trend towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility in <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>; I claim that the model supports the idea that, under 
              certain conditions, it is possible for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility 
              to increase without bound. In this model, there is active selection 
              for increased <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility; there is a selective force 
              that drives the increase; it is not merely a statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>, 
              due to a bounded diffusion process. The model shows how a purely 
              local selection process can yield a global trend.</p>
<p>The model also shows that the environment must be highly dynamic 
              (the target for the fitness function must change significantly and 
              repeatedly) to sustain increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. If the 
              environment is not sufficiently dynamic, the disruptive effects 
              of mutation will outweigh the beneficial effects, and selection 
              will drive the mutation rates to zero. When the mutation rate is 
              zero throughout the population, the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> length can no longer 
              increase, so the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility is bounded by the length 
              of the longest <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> in the population.</p>
<p>I believe that, in fact, there is a large-scale trend towards increasing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility in <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Although the model 
              does not (and cannot) prove this belief, the model suggests a way 
              to test the belief, because the model predicts that, where there 
              is increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility, there should be an accelerating 
              pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> (see the fourth plots in Figures 2 and 3). Therefore, 
              I predict that we will find evidence for an accelerating pace in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s.</p>
<p>It is difficult to <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ively verify the claim that the pace of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is accelerating. The natural measure of the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              is the historical frequency of innovations, but the analysis is 
              complicated by several factors. One confounding factor is that the 
              record of the recent past is superior to the record of the distant 
              past, which may give the illusion that there are more innovations 
              in the recent past than the distant past. Another confounding factor 
              is population <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>. We may expect more innovations in recent <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              simply because there are more innovators. A third factor is difficulty 
              of counting innovations. There is a need for an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive threshold 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of the innovations, so that the vast <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 
              trivial innovations can be ignored.</p>
<p>I suggest some tests that avoid these <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ions. I predict that 
              the fossil record will show a decreasing recovery <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> from major 
              catastrophes, such as mass <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> events, ice ages, meteorite 
              impacts, and volcanic eruptions. Also, I predict a decrease in the 
              average lifetimes of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, as they are out-competed by more recent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> at an accelerating rate [15]. These two tests do not involve 
              counting the frequency of innovations, which makes them relatively 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive.</p>
<h1>8. Limitations and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Work</h1>
<p>There are several limitations to this work. One limitation is that 
              we cannot run the model to <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>, so we cannot prove empirically 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility will grow to <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>. I conjecture 
              that, with the baseline settings of the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s (Table 1), the 
              expected (i.e., mean, average) <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility of the model 
              will rise to <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a> as RUN_LENGTH rises to <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>. This conjecture 
              can be supported by empirical evidence (Figure 3), but it can only 
              be proven by theoretical argument. I have not yet developed this 
              theoretical argument.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the model is its abstractness. A more sophisticated 
              model would include (1) a non-trivial <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> mapping, 
              (2) an internal, implicit fitness function, instead of the current, 
              external, explicit fitness function, (3) a <a class="thought" href="entries/genotype_entry.html">genotype</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> mapping 
              and fitness function that allow varying degrees of dependence and 
              independence among the dimensions (i.e., traits, characteristics) 
              along which variation can occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, (4) the possibility 
              of covariation, (5) coevolution, (6) multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, (7) predator-prey 
              relationships, and so on. However, the point of this exercise was 
              to make the model as abstract as possible, in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to identify 
              the minimum <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s that are needed to display unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility. The abstractness of the model was intended to make 
              it more clear and susceptible to analysis.</p>
<p>There might seem to be some conflict between this model and the 
              &#8220;no free lunch&#8221; theorems [43]. Informally, the &#8220;no 
              free lunch&#8221; theorems show that there is no universal optimization 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> that is optimal for all fitness landscapes. For example, 
              one &#8220;no free lunch&#8221; theorem (Theorem 1 in [43]) shows 
              that, for any two optimization <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s and , the average fitness 
              obtained by equals the average fitness obtained by , when the average 
              is calculated over all possible fitness landscapes, sampled with 
              uniform probability. If my model can reach infinite fitness levels, 
              for some fitness landscapes, does this violate a &#8220;no free lunch&#8221; 
              theorem, since then the average fitness must also be infinite? There 
              is no problem here, because the &#8220;no free lunch&#8221; theorems 
              are concerned with the fitness after a finite <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of iterations, 
              not with the fitness after an infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of iterations (in 
              my case, an infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of children).</p>
<p>The model that is presented here is not intended to be a new, superior 
              form of optimization <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>. The intent of the model is to show 
              that it is possible, under certain conditions, for <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility to increase without bound. Furthermore, the model is 
              intended to show that local selection (in this case, local to a 
              certain period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) can drive a global trend (global across 
              all periods of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. 
              The model is not universal; it will only display unbounded increase 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility for certain <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings and for 
              certain fitness landscapes. The fitness landscape is defined by 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s TARGET_CHANGE_RATE and ERA_LENGTH and by the general 
              design of the model (Figure 1). <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a>s 1 and 2 show that the 
              model appears to display unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility for 
              the baseline fitness landscape (the fitness landscape that is defined 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> settings in Table 1), but <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 4 and 5 show 
              that there are neighbouring fitness landscapes for which <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility is bounded. The <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s here have only explored 
              a few of the infinitely many possible fitness landscapes. Of the 
              fitness landscapes that were explored here, only a few appeared 
              to display unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility.</p>
<h1>9. Conclusions</h1>
<p>This paper introduces a simple model of unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility. The model is primarily intended to address the claim 
              that natural selection cannot produce a large-scale trend, because 
              it is a purely local process. The model shows that local selection 
              can produce a global trend towards increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. 
              The model suggests that this trend can continue without bound, if 
              there is sufficient ongoing change in the environment.</p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility to increase without bound, it must 
              be possible for the lengths of <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s to increase. If there is 
              a bound on the length of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s, then there must be a bound 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility. A model of unbounded <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility must therefore allow mutations that occasionally change 
              the length of a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. It seems possible that, once <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s reach 
              a certain length, the benefit that might be obtained from greater 
              length would be countered by the damage that mutation can do to 
              the useful genes that have been found so far. At this point, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility might stop increasing.</p>
<p>To address this issue, the model allows the mutation rate to adapt. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s show that, indeed, if there is little change in 
              the environment, then the damage of mutation is greater than the 
              benefit of mutation, so the mutation rate goes to zero and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility stops increasing. However, if there is sufficient change 
              in the environment, it appears that the mutation rate reaches a 
              stable non-zero value and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility continues to 
              increase indefinitely.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting observation is that the fitness increase 
              during an era grows over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (see the fourth plots in Figures 2 
              and 3). That is, increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility leads to an 
              accelerating pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. One of the most interesting questions 
              about this model is whether it plausible as a highly abstract model 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. One test of its plausibility 
              is to look for signs that the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is accelerating. 
              For example, does the fossil record show a decreasing recovery <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              from major catastrophes? Is there a decrease in the average lifetimes 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>?</p>
<p>If there is evidence that the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is accelerating, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary versatility may be better able to account for this 
              than the other seven live hypotheses [21]. It is not clear how any 
              of the other hypotheses could be used to explain the acceleration, 
              although it seems to be a natural consequence of increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              versatility.</p>

You just have to realize there might not be a lot of other people joining you in this tradition and that might make communicating with the rest difficult.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The model described is quite simple, easy to code and verify, although the pseudocode given has a bit of ambiguity.  I an still trying to analyse it to determine if there are hidden (unintended) biases toward increasing genome length (which is the measure of versatility in this model.)  There are areas of concern I will express below.  First, a very brief synopsis of the model.
<br>
<br>
We have a population of individuals that look like
<br>
<br>
  [mutation-rate-bits][phenotype-bits]
<br>
<br>
Where the number of mutation-rate-bits is fixed, and hold a random value potentially different for each individual.  The phenotype-bits (zero or more) represent the independent dimensions of possible variation.  Finally, the "environment" is given by a random string, which is compared, bit-for-bit, with the phenotype bits of each individual tp produce a "measure of fitness" for each member.
<br>
<br>
The population "turns over" one individual at a time, through a mate-selection, child-creation, and elimination of a "worst-fit" member for each child created.  Mate selection consists of sampling the population, selecting two "most fit" members as parents.  Child creation entails selecting a random "cross-over" point in (I believe) the phenotype-coding part of both parents, and joining the left-half of one to the right half of the other to form the child's inherited genome.  Then, the "mutation rate" section is consulted, and used as a probability to "flip" an arbitrary bit in the resulting genome, and to add (or subtract) to or from the end of the genome.  Thus childern may have shorter or longer genomes than their parents.
<br>
<br>
Importantly, if a child genome is created that is longer than the "environment" bit-string, the environment string is increased as well.
<br>
<br>
RESULT:  The author demonstrates that if the environment string is left stable (not wholly swapped out) then "evolutionary versatility" (length of genomes) tends to limit as well.  But if the entire "environment" is periodically randomized, then the average genome lengths tend to grow indefinitely.
<br>
<br>
My Concern(s):  The measure of member-fitness is given by the absolute number of a member's phenotype-bits that match the current environment-bits, rather than the PERCENTAGE match.  It seems plain that if a random-walk increase-decrease in the length of a child genome "ratchets-up" the environment length you have biased the fitness measure to grow accordingly.  That is, for two individuals whose phenotype is already a "good match" to the environment, when the environment grows, the a child with a longer genome will on average yield a better fit than a child whose genome did not increase.
<br>
<br>
Also, the pseudocode states that when a resulting child genome is "too short", its fitness is set to zero.  I can only surmise that "too short" means "phenotype-length shorter than environment-length."    This would be "unfair" (if true) since there would still be many "bits" that align with (and possibly match) the environment.
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I would like to be a bit more explicit in my concern about the model in question.  Form my take of the pseudocode (and explanatory material) we may have, effectively, the following situation:
<br>
<br>
1.  Let the environment ne represented by a string of 30 bits.  Each bit represents some Boolean quality of the environment (hot/not-hot, wet/not-wet, whatever.)
<br>
<br>
We examine two individuals, A and B.
<br>
<br>
A.  This individual has (say) 10 phentotype bits, corresponding to the first 10 environment parameters.  Suppose that 8 out of 10 of these bits are a "match" to the environment (fitness.)  Note that this DOES NOT mean that the individual is poorly fit to the remaining 20 environment bits, but only that the individual does not bequeath "evolutionary variability" in those dimensions to its potential offspring.  In any case, the "fitness measure" for this particular creature is 8.
<br>
<br>
B.  Suppose this individual has 20 phenotype bits (contributing evolutionary variability).  Furthermore, suppose that the first 10 of these bits have exactly the same setting as individual A above, but the latter 10 bits are such that only 3 of them are a "match" to the corresponding environment bits.  This creature "B" (as I understand the model) gets a score of 11 for "fitness", makeing it "more fit" than "A", even though we do not measure that individual's fitness for parameter possessing no variability.
<br>
<br>
If I am correct about the model, this will naturally favor longer genomes over shorter ones, irrespective of fitness, on average.  Coupled with the rule that forces the environment to grow as the largest (mutant) child genome does seems to further bias the model.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I have mis-read or misinterpreted the details.  I hope so.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Greetings,
<br>
<br>
I came across this article on new research results from the Center for Computational Genetics and Biological Modeling at Stanford. It seems to lend support to Wolfram's assertions regarding natural selection's limited role in producing biological complexity (being in this case gene networks) as outlined in A New Kind of Science. Below is an except and a link to the article:
<br>
<br>
--Scientists used to think that developmental fidelity evolved via natural selection, principally through survival and reproduction of organisms with redundant genetic systems -- that is, ones with copies of important gene sequences. But Siegal and Bergman's results indicate that redundancy may only be one small manifestation of a bigger theme: the complexity of gene networks. In short, more complex systems are more resistant to change in their outputs. 
<br>
<br>
"It is typically assumed that important properties of organisms are crafted by natural selection," says Dmitri Petrov, assistant professor of biological sciences. "What Siegal and Bergman show is that robustness in the face of mutation, or canalization, may be a byproduct of complexity itself and therefore that robustness may be only very indirectly a product of natural selection." 
<br>
<br>
Says Siegal: "It might be that the complex nature of the genetic system itself is going to give you canalization independent of natural selection. This complexity goes beyond mere redundancy, incorporating all kinds of elaborate connections in the gene network." 
<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean natural selection doesn't play an important role. Continues Petrov: "Natural selection has shaped the genetic networks of complex organisms so that they produce appropriate phenotypes -- the more highly interconnected these networks are, the more robust the corresponding phenotypes are. The importance of this result is that it shifts the focus of the field away from abstract models of natural selection and toward actual genetic networks. In so doing, it will provide a new perspective for analyzing and understanding the current outpouring of genetic data in model organisms." --

<br>
<br>
By my understanding, natural selection does not "produce" complexity, or anything else.
<br>
<br>
Variations, (and thus the opportunities for complexity) are "produced" by random mutations.  As complexity grows, there are more occasions for mutation to produce variations, leading potentilly to greater complexity.
<br>
<br>
Natural selection simply explains why some complexities stick around, and others do not.
<br>
<br>
By the way, I ran several simulations that reaffirmed how periodic changes in the environment accelerate the rate at which longer genomes take hold.
<br>
<br>
If the environment remains stable and unchanging, those species that tend to yield "variable children" fare poorly, and the average genome length tends to plateau.  This makes sense, because the existing species are already well-suited to their environment, so any new variations tend to lead away from the optimum.  This is true, even when the number of "genome variables" is far smaller than the number of environmental parameters to "fit to", under the (reasonable) asumption of assigning a constant 0.5 "fitness" for the genomic constants. 
<br>
<br>
In other words, if a mutation occurs to a genomic variable, the tendency is to move away from fitness (since the population is already well adapted), while a mutation that increases the genome (turning a genomic constant into a variable) is as likely to get better as to get worse.  Overall, there is insufficient "pressure" to favor variability.
<br>
<br>
However, when a cataclysmic change occurs in the environment, there is a (relatively short) period where several forces are observed:  (1), the "previously fit" species no longer "fit" and diminish in proportion.  (2) the most of the rare variations fare no better, but (3) some of the "rare" variations take hold, and soon dominate the populations and these have, on average, a longer genome than their predecessors.
<br>
<br>
The tendency to longer genome seems to occur because the "advantage of non-variability" is effectively destroyed.  Almost no one fares very well for a while, but those with greater variability (including varibility of genome length) are exclusively those that can "find a new fit", and those whose "fit" is over an increased number of genomic variables obtain a higher overall fitness score.
<br>
<br>
By randomly altering a good percentage of the environmental parameters every few hundred generations, the average genomic length looks like a rounded stair-step function - rising soon after the environmental disruption, and then tending to plateau until a new disruption occurs.
<br>
<br>
It seems my original concerns were unfounded (see several posts back.)
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Does the acceptance of the "wall of minimum complexity" concept include a corresponding yet unacknowledged "wall of maximum complexity" construct? Is every response to a changing (and perhaps more complex) dynamic going to necessarily be more complex in response or will the total complexity of the environment demand a simpler adaptation at some time (blind dolphins in China come to mind)?
<br>
And what about evolutionary trade offs?  Could there be evolution to extinction? Wouldn't extinction define a wall of maximum complexity because no further adaptions are possible?
