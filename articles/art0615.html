<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net March 7, 2004.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> I&#8217;m honored to receive this prestigious award, and I thank 
              you for recognizing me in this way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sue Spungin, who just spoke, mentioned having been impressed by 
              the exhibits on Alexander Graham Bell and <a class="thought" href="entries/edison_entry.html">Thomas Edison</a> at the National 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">Inventor</a> Hall of Fame. It&#8217;s interesting to note that both men 
              were motivated by the idea of creating disabilities <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. 
              Bell was trying to develop a sensory aid for the deaf, and ended 
              up inventing the telephone. Edison&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the phonograph 
              player was intended as a &#8220;talking book&#8221; for the blind. 
              It is often the case that what starts as an <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ibility technology 
              for the disabled ends up having <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>-shifting mainstream applications. 
            </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I&#8217;d like to share an observation that has motivated my career 
              in disabilities technology. It is simply this: there is an essential 
              difference between the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of &#8220;disability&#8221; and &#8220;handicap.&#8221; 
              The word disability is straightforward: it refers to the lack of 
              an ability. All of us lack abilities. None of us is good at everything. 
              A handicap, on the other hand, refers to a fundamental barrier in 
              gaining equal access to opportunities in key facets of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> such 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> and employment. A disability such as blindness does 
              not necessarily need to result in a handicap. This, I believe, sums 
              up the vital goal of work in the disabilities field. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> What is required to achieve this? Technology has an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              role to play. Technology such as <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a>s can provide needed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a compensatory format using another <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. I&#8217;m 
              proud to have played a role in this arena, and my 30 years of work 
              in reading machines for the blind has been the most gratifying endeavor 
              in my career. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I was developing the Kurzweil Reading Machine in the 1970s, 
              I worked closely with a talented group of blind scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers 
              from the National Federation of the Blind, and the project benefited 
              enormously from this unique collaboration. Other talented people 
              have contributed their skills over the years to bring this technology 
              to where it is today. In particular, I would like to recognize Stephen 
              Baum, who heads up the development team at Kurzweil Educational 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s for his decades of devoted and brilliant contributions. 
              Today, I&#8217;m working again with the NFB to develop a pocket-size 
              reading machine, which will enable a blind person to snap a picture 
              of a wall sign, the back of a cereal box, an LCD display, a handout 
              at a meeting, and other examples of real-world print, and instantly 
              convert it to synthetic speech. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To achieve full equality in <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, we also need training, not 
              all of which is technology-oriented. The fiberglass cane is low 
              tech, but with modern mobility skills effectively eliminates a travel 
              handicap. Perhaps the most important requirement is attitude. First, 
              on the part of society, the understanding that blind persons can 
              compete on terms of equality is critical. Perhaps a blind person 
              can&#8217;t drive a taxi today, but there are no significant areas 
              of employment that a blind person is unable to excel at. Even driving 
              a vehicle is going to be feasible in a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of years. Of course, 
              we&#8217;ll need some new technology for that, something I may want 
              to get involved in myself in <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> years. Finally, the attitude 
              of the blind person herself towards her own abilities is also crucial 
              to overcome society&#8217;s ancient prejudices regarding the abilities 
              of the blind. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> We&#8217;ve come a long way in all of these dimensions, and I&#8217;m 
              proud to have played a role in disabilities technology, along with 
              many other dedicated people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a couple of decades, we will have new ways of communicating 
              directly into our brains noninvasively using blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-sized robots 
              in our bloodstream. These new <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s will ultimately provide new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> paradigms that go far beyond the visual and 
              auditory sense. These extensions of the human nervous system will 
              provide new opportunities for overcoming the communication disabilities 
              associated with vision and hearing impairment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> However, we need to keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that that new technologies that 
              provide new opportunities can also present new barriers. Consider 
              the graphic user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>, which was completely inaccessible when 
              first introduced. Or the panoply of new mobile <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s 
              that are not sufficiently accessible today. This is a <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> challenge 
              for those of us who create new technology: enable people with disabilities 
              to share in the promise of new technology while avoiding the creation 
              of new obstacles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you once again for this special honor.</p>

<p>Ray Kurzweil was the principal inventor of the first print-to-speech 
              reading machine for the blind, the first omni-font optical character 
              recognition, the first CCD flat-bed scanner, and the first text-to-speech 
              synthesizer in 1975 and 1976. </p>
<p>The Kurzweil Reading Machine, developed by Ray Kurzweil with the 
              National Federation of the Blind in the mid-1970s, scans books, 
              magazine articles, and any other printed or typed documents and 
              converts the pages into synthetic speech. It provided access to 
              ordinary printed material to the blind for the first time. Ray has 
              continued to work on reading technology over the past thirty years. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>The Kurzweil 1000 reading system from Kurzweil Educational Systems, 
              Inc. continues today as the market leader for print-to-speech reading 
              software for the blind. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ray, Congratulations on your Blind Migel Award.  Your acceptance speech reminds me of a friend who was Blind who said the word handicapped should be reserved for golfers and horse racing, because it is such a negative word.  I think that the technology for persons with disabilities is at the front of the curve in many ways, and thinking out of the box is the only way to create the equal access that everyone deserves.

With much respect,
