<p>For the last 4 years, <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a> has been teasing us with brief 
              extracts from his forthcoming <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925125554/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm" target="_blank">Nanomedicine, 
              Volume IIA</a></i>, in his quarterly <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> articles for <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925125554/http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Publications.html" target="_blank">Foresight 
              Update</a></i>.&#160; The second installment of this famous series is 
              in press and should be out by September 2003.&#160; A full online version 
              will appear in the months to come, though an outline is available 
              now at Robert's nanomedicine site <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925125554/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm" target="_blank">http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm</a>.</p>
<p>There are now four books in the Nanomedicine trilogy&#8212;what 
              began as a single chapter in Volume II has grown into a book: Volume 
              IIA.&#160; This is hardly surprising when we consider how critical biocompatibility 
              is to the safety, effectiveness, and <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> of medical nanorobotic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, and the magnitude and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the subject <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>.</p>
<p>In his usual thorough fashion, Freitas gives us an overview of 
              essentially the entire field of biocompatibility as it relates to 
              medical nanorobots and the materials that might be used in their 
              construction.&#160; While the target audience is "biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, 
              biocompatibility engineers, medical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s engineers, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              physiologists, clinical laboratory analysts, and other technical 
              and professional people who are seriously interested in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              of medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>" this volume comes at a timely juncture: 
              published concerns about the biocompatibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              are growing in the environmental community, and a solid foundation 
              on which to base the discussion is greatly welcomed. This new book 
              provides a technical tour-de-force and a treasure trove of facts, 
              ideas, and recent research results, with an extensive 1400-entry 
              glossary and over 6100 literature citations in the reference list, 
              representing 8000 man-hours of effort by the author.&#160; This book 
              should be the starting point for anyone planning a serious research 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> in medical nanorobot design.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to give the reader an overview of what <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925125554/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm" target="_blank">Nanomedicine 
              Volume IIA</a></i> is all about is to quote a few words from Freitas 
              describing just part of this Magnum Opus:</p>
<blockquote><i><p>"Compatibility" most broadly refers to the suitability 
              of two distinct systems or classes of things to be mixed or taken 
              together without unfavorable results.&#160; More specifically, the safety, 
              effectiveness, and utility of medical nanorobotic devices will critically 
              depend upon their biocompatibility with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> organs, tissues, cells, 
              and biochemical systems.&#160; Classical biocompatibility has often focused 
              on the immunological and thrombogenic reactions of the body to foreign 
              substances placed within it.&#160; In this Volume, we broaden the definition 
              of nanomedical biocompatibility to include all of the mechanical, 
              physiological, immunological, cytological, and biochemical responses 
              of the human body to the introduction of medical nanodevices, whether 
              "particulate" or "bulk" in form.&#160; That is, medical 
              nanodevices may include large doses of independent micron-sized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> nanorobots, or alternatively may include macroscale nanoorgans 
              (nanorobotic organs) assembled either as solid <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s or built 
              up from trillions of smaller artificial cells or docked nanorobots 
              inside the body.&#160; We also discuss the effects on the nanorobot of 
              being placed inside the human body.</p></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i><p>In most cases, the biocompatibility of nanomedical devices may 
              be regarded as a problem of equivalent difficulty to finding biocompatible 
              surfaces for implants and prostheses that will only be present in 
              vivo for a relatively short <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.&#160; That's because fast-acting medical 
              nanorobots will usually be removed from the body after their diagnostic 
              or therapeutic purpose is complete.&#160; In these <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s, special 
              surface coatings along with arrays of active presentation semaphores 
              may suffice.&#160; At the other extreme, very long-lived prostheses are 
              already feasible with macroscale implants such as artificial knee 
              joints, pins, and metal plates that are embedded in bone.&#160; As our 
              control of material properties extends more completely into the 
              molecular realm, surface characteristics can be modulated and reprogrammed, 
              hopefully permitting long-term biocompatibility to be achieved.&#160; 
              In some cases, nanoorgans may be coated with an adherent layer of 
              immune-compatible natural or engineered cells in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to blend 
              in and integrate thoroughly with their surroundings.&#160; Today (in 
              2002), the broad outlines of the general solutions to nanodevice 
              biocompatibility are already apparent.&#160; However, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on the long-term 
              effects of implants is at best incomplete and many <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant aspects 
              of nanomedical biocompatibility are still unresolved&amp;#8212and will 
              remain unresolved until an active <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al program is undertaken 
              to systematically investigate them.</p></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i><p>Since a common building material for medical nanorobots is likely 
              to be diamond or diamondoid substances, the first and most obvious 
              question is whether diamondoid devices or their <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s are likely 
              to be hazardous to the human body.&#160; Chapter 15.1 briefly explores 
              the potential for crude mechanical damage to human tissues caused 
              by the ingestion or inhalation of diamond or related <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s.&#160; 
              There are varying degrees of potential mechanical injury and these 
              are probably ultimately dose-dependent.&#160; It will be part of any 
              medical nanorobot research project to determine the actual amount 
              of diamondoid particulate matter necessary to cause clinically significant 
              injury.</p></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i><p>A great deal of preliminary <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is already available on 
              the biocompatibility of various materials that are likely to find 
              extensive use in medical nanorobots.&#160; Chapter 15.3 includes a review 
              of the experimental literature describing the known overall biocompatibility 
              of diamond, <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> fullerenes and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, nondiamondoid carbon, 
              fluorinated carbon (e.g., Teflon), sapphire and alumina, and a few 
              other possible nanomedical materials such as <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and dendrimers&#8212;in 
              both bulk and particulate forms.</p></i></blockquote>
<p>One of the more interesting issues is that medical nanorobots might 
              be consumed by the body's defenders, the white cells. Thus, nanorobots 
              will have to dodge, pacify, or escape from their embrace. As Freitas 
              observes: "... all nanorobots that are of a size capable of 
              ingestion by phagocytic cells must incorporate physical mechanisms 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>al protocols for avoiding and escaping from phagocytes.&#160; 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> strategy is first to avoid phagocytic contact, recognition, 
              or binding and activation, and secondly, if this fails, then to 
              inhibit phagocytic engulfment or enclosure and scission of the phagosome.&#160; 
              If trapped, the medical nanorobot can induce exocytosis of the phagosomal 
              vacuole in which it is lodged or inhibit both phagolysosomal fusion 
              and phagosome metabolism.&#160; In rare circumstances, it may be necessary 
              to kill the phagocyte or to blockade the entire phagocytic system.&#160; 
              Of course, the most direct approach for a fully-functional medical 
              nanorobot is to employ its motility mechanisms to locomote out of, 
              or away from, the phagocytic <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> that is attempting to engulf it.&#160; 
              This may involve reverse cytopenetration, which must be done cautiously 
              (e.g., the rapid exit of nonenveloped viruses from cells can be 
              cytotoxic).&#160; It is possible that frustrated phagocytosis may induce 
              a localized compensatory granulomatous reaction.&#160; Medical nanorobots 
              therefore may also need to employ simple but active defensive strategies 
              to forestall granuloma formation."</p>
<p>And, as always, Freitas is famous not just for his thorough coverage 
              of the field, but also for the historical side lights that enliven 
              his text. Pounded diamond dust, for example, was used by assassins 
              through the ages&amp;#8212an observation that inspired Freitas to investigate 
              the issue more directly by examining pounded diamonds with a scanning 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> microscope (SEM) and confirming that "even a single 
              hammer blow produced numerous particles of a wide variety of sizes 
              (0.1-100 micron), many possessing sharp ragged 'fishhook' edges, 
              deep angular concavities, serrations, irregular holes, and other 
              interesting features."&#160; No doubt of greater concern to his 
              wife was his earlier report (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060925125554/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/9.5.1.htm#p3" target="_blank">http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/9.5.1.htm#p3</a>) 
              of self-experimentation with (albeit uncrushed) diamond powder, 
              finding that "even irregularly-shaped diamondoid particles 
              ~3 microns and smaller apparently roll smoothly out of the way when 
              ground between the teeth, whereas particles larger than ~3 microns 
              cannot roll sufficiently and retain a sensible grittiness."</p>
<p>This excellent volume provides us with yet another authoritative 
              analysis of issues that are critical to the development of nanomedicine&amp;#8212and 
              again makes clear that, while there is much to do there are no insurmountable 
              obstacles nor fundamental barriers that stand in our way.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To end with a question: do you expect to be alive in thirty years? 
              If so&amp;#8212and most people do&amp;#8212then the development of nanomedicine 
              within that time frame will benefit you directly. The medical nanorobots 
              we are talking about could save your &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Life')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Life')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, the lives of your loved 
              ones and the lives of your friends. This is possible and even likely, 
              but not inevitable. How long it takes to develop this life saving 
              technology depends on what we do&amp;#8212it is not happening according 
              to some cosmic plan, with a date engraved in stone that neither 
              you nor I can change&amp;#8212but rather it will take as long as we 
              let it take. Yes, thirty years is a long time. Yes, most people 
              have a hard time &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Thinking')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Thinking')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; about the next year, let alone the next 
              decade, let alone a few decades hence. But if we don't act today, 
              then we might one day wake up in a future where we are old and infirm 
              and the promise of nanomedicine is still just that: a promise. To 
              paraphrase a famous slogan: think long term, act short term.&lt;/p&gt;
