<div class="TeaserText">This excerpt from Telecosm (Free Press/Simon &amp; Shuster) encapsulates futurist George Gilder's grand vision of the age of the telecosm--in which infinite bandwidth will revolutionize the world.</div>
<br>
<br><h1>1) The Law of the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a></h1><p>Originally published September 2000 as part of <i><a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a>: How Infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> Will Revolutionize Our World</i>. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>The value of a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> grows by the square of the processing power of all the terminals attached to it. In fact, this is a restatement of <i>Metcalfe's law</i> ("<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a> value rises by the square of the number of terminals"). As the power and storewidth of terminals rises, the value of reaching them soars. <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> traffic is a good proxy for this effect. Rising at least a thousand times every five years, the trajectory of traffic indicates that a current <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> company is confronting just one tenth of one percent of its potential volume half a decade hence. This phenomenon impels both the exponentially rising value and the sometimes shocking volatility of investments in the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a>.</p><h2>2) Gilder's Law</h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> grows at least three times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power. While <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power doubles every eighteen months (<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>), <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s power doubles every six months. This is a rough average; as with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>, it may take a few years before the pace reaches its natural rate. Practical backbone <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> on a single cable is now a thousand times greater than the entire average traffic on the global <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s infrastructure five years ago. More <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can be sent over a single cable in a second than was sent over the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> in 1997 in a month.</p><h2>3) The Black Box Law</h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a>s will become black boxes: dumb pipes, with <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> spread to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s at their peripheries. Past <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, including the phone <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, have been "smart" and narrowband. <a class="thought" href="entries/broadband_entry.html">Broadband</a> flourishes with the reverse.</p><h2>4) The Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> Efficiency</h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> usability, measured in <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> efficiency, grows roughly by the square of the move up spectrum to higher frequencies. Both <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s capacity rises as transmissions move from long wavelengths and low frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum to short wavelengths and high frequencies at the top. In the air, for example, <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> has moved from 900 megahertz <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_phone_entry.html">cellular phone</a>s to 2 gigahertz <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> personal <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s (PCS) with web <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, and to 24 and 38 gigahertz <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> services offering extremely rich links to urban buildings, and finally to TeraBeam's fiberless optics employing the same frequencies of infrared <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> now used in fiber.</p><h2>5) Shannon's Law</h2><p><a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s efficiency declines as power increases, or, conversely, efficiency increases as power weakens. Increased electrical power means more dispersion and nonlinearity in fiber and more interference in the air. Reducing power expended per <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> enables exponentially increasing bitrates. The rise of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> implies a constant preoccupation with reducing the power usage of every <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> infrastructure. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ing lies in small, long-lasting batteries, powering lots of <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, joined together in a massive web.</p><h2>6) The <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a>-Power <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">Identity</a></h2><p>A corollary of Shannon's law is that <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a><i> is a replacement</i> for power. With enough <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers can simulate any powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> they please. Optical <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> will inexorably drive <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es and <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>s out of the center of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> where they just get in the way of bits and slow them down. In both fiber and air, the expansion of <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> geometrically increases <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s efficiency. <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> comes from using more of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> spectrum and less electrical power. The spectrum is essentially infinite.</p><h2>7) The Glass Mansions Law</h2><p>In the cities of the world, fiber trumps both copper and the airwaves. <a class="thought" href="entries/fiber_optics_entry.html">Fiber optics</a> is some ten billion times more capacious and reliable than copper or air. Many companies claim to offer "copper optics" or satellites that compete with fiber. But these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, for all their special advantages of installed base or mobile <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> or broadcast reach, are not even remotely competitive with fiber for <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>. One fiber thread can command a hundred times more <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> than all the satellites in the world put together. Satellites will be useful chiefly in rural areas that are too remote from fiber lines.</p><h2>8) The Yellow Pages Law</h2><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">telecosm</a> demands better and better directories, and the companies that produce them will succeed. <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> is created by <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> (optics, etc.), but the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s they enable will need better and better <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Hence, the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">telecosm</a> opens huge opportunities for clever ways to cache, mirror, replicate, sort, and <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p><h2>9) The Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a>ic Price Elasticity</h2><p>One unit decline in <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> price yields a five unit rise in demand. Fears of a <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> glut are groundless. <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a> multiplies its own demand. (As one example, business-to-business <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> has been exploding and price per <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> plummeting, and business-to-business traffic on UUNet has been doubling every 90 to 120 days.)</p><h2>10) The Law of Instantaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a></h2><p>This law is a commandment to <i>save <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a></i>: the companies that save their clients <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> will profit in the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">telecosm</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> to market, turnaround <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, disk seek and rotate <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to retirement, <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> delay <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> all reduce to two key metrics: the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and the span of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. A physical limit and a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> limit, these are the governing scarcities of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> age.</p><h2>11) The Law of Wasted <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">Bandwidth</a></h2><p>The governing abundance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> age is <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s capacity. This law is a commandment to <i>waste </i><a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>. The companies that exploit <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> recklessly will profit by it.</p><h2>12) Amdahl's Law in the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a></h2><p>A law defined by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designer Gene Amdahl, known as Amdahl's law, ordains that <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> speed is determined by the slowest <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> in the datapath. Combining this with Drucker's law (by Peter Drucker) that profits migrate to the supplier of the missing <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> necessary to complete a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, the conclusion is clear: The missing <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s today are cheap chips that can operate at optical speeds. Profits will migrate to optical-speed <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> makers.</p><h2>13) The Single-<a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">Chip</a> Law</h2><p>A corollary of the above is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a> requires <i>single-<a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s</i>. Chips operating at a billion cycles per second simply have no <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to go off <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> to retrieve instructions and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>.</p><h2>14) The Law of Hand-Held <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a>s</h2><p>When <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> is infinite, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> is ubiquitous, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> cellular <i>teleputers</i> prevail. These <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s will economize on power and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> area. Power and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> were two prime abundances of twentieth-century <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, when power came from outlets in your wall and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> spread across <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> backplanes and mother boards. In the twenty-first century, they are defining scarcities.</p><h2>15) The Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a> Computing</h2><p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">telecosm</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> becomes the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s disaggregate across the net and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> disaggregates into <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s on the net.</p><h2>16) Huber's Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/geodesic_entry.html">Geodesic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a>s</h2><p>Putting together Shannon's law with the law of <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> efficiency produces a vision of the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s that will prevail. As coined by Peter Huber, they are "<a class="thought" href="entries/geodesic_entry.html">geodesic</a>": short-connection, multipoint, dense arrays. The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength, the wider the <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, the lower the power, the smaller the antennae, the slimmer the cells, the cheaper and better the <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>.</p><h2>17) The Low-Latency Law of Satellites</h2><p>Satellites will move <i>from far and fast to low and slow</i>, from the geosynchronous <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a> 36,000 kilometers above the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> to far slower low <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a> paths fifty times closer to the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. To the geosynchronous <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a>, signals take a quarter of a second-a showstopper amount of latency for interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. Bouncing to low-<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> orbits and back, signals move fast enough to race <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s in fiber.</p><h2>18) The Law of Television Obsolescence</h2><p>
<i>Television</i>, high powered and low choice, <i>will die</i>. It is rapidly giving way to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>'s low-powered <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> with myriad choices. A corollary of this law concerns advertising: TV advertisements are not adds; they are minuses. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> banners are not adds either. They will give way to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>al and transactional ads that people want. The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> empowers the customer; in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> companies will not be able to tease or trick their customers into reading their ads.</p><h2>19) The Law of Journalistic Victory</h2><p>
<i>Profits will migrate toward newspapers and magazines</i>. Unlike television, newspapers already empower their customers. Newspaper readers can read at their own pace and schedule, respond to stories with letters, clip and save desired material, ignore undesired ads, and even advertise themselves in the classified section. All these functions become more effective on the net. It will be much easier for newspapers to acquire web <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and video than for television stations to acquire real news reporting and valuable editorial <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>.</p><h2>20) The Law of Conduits and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">Content</a></h2><p>This law comes in the form of a commandment <i>to divorce <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> from conduit</i>. The less <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> owns the more <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> flows through it. If you are a <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> company, you want your <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> to travel on all <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, not just your own. If you are a conduit company, you want to carry everyone's <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, not restrict yourself to your own. Companies that violate this rule (AU, AOL <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Warner) tear themselves apart. The dumber the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> the more <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> it can carry.</p>
