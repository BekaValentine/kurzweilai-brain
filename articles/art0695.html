<p>Turbine engine history goes back to the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> <span dir="ltr">century</span>.  In 1903 the Norwegian <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> Aegidus Elling became the first person  to successfully construct a gas turbine engine which produced excess  power, reaching 11hp (the Wright brothers Kitty Hawk which flew for the  first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that year had 12hp). Several years later Charles Curtis, who  invented the Curtis steam engine, filed the first <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> application in  the U.S. for a gas turbine engine which he was granted in 1914 (but not  without some controversy). Four years later, in 1918, General Electric  (GE), founded by Edison in the mid 1870s, started work on aircraft  engine turbochargers and two decades later on aircraft jet engines on  their gas turbine division (now one of the biggest in the world). In  1930 the inventor and Royal Air Force officer Sir Frank Whittle,  building on previous work including that of Elling, designed and  patented the first gas turbine for jet propulsion. After a neck to neck  race to build the first jet powered engine, the German Hans von Ohain,  working with the Heinkel Company, became the first to design and test a  jet powered aircraft in 1939 beating Whittle which suffered from  technical problems with his design.&#160;&#160;            </p>

<p>Enormous  gas turbine engines are also used for electrical power production. In a  gas turbine (also known as combustion-turbine), hot gases produced from  the combustion of natural gas in a high-pressure combustion chamber are  passed through the turbine, which spins the generator to produce  electricity. Gas turbines are commonly used to serve the peak loads of  the electric <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> and have grown in size and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> over the  years.

<p>Beside  airplanes and power plants gas turbine engines have many other uses,  ranging from tank engines (gas turbine engine is used in the M1A1  Abrams tank), ship and locomotive engines as well as auxiliary power  units. But beside those large scale solutions, new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has  allowed smaller and smaller versions of gas turbines. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100323074750/http://www.ihi.co.jp/ia/index-e.html" target="_blank">IHI Aerospace</a> in Japan developed a small portable gas turbine generator called  Dynajet 2.6, which produces 2.6 kW and has a total weight of 67  kilograms. A different micro sized gas turbine was developed by  researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich).  This tiny turbine reached a size of several centimeters producing up to  100 watts of electricity for a period of several days. Pushing the  technology even further, researchers at the&#160;Massachusetts Institute of  Technology developed the building blocks for an even smaller gas  turbine engine with a size of about 1 mm which they hope will be fully  assembled and functioning before the end of 2007.&#160;&#160;

<p>Although  it might be hard to see the resemblance between a giant like the GE90  and the millimeter scale engine being developed at MIT, they actually  have quite a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> in common with each other. A gas turbine, both large  and small consists of a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine  that is driven by the combustion exhaust and powers the compressor.  Upon start-up, fuel is injected at the compressor exit, mixes with air,  ignites and escapes in high pressure through the exhaust, spinning the  turbine which is used to power the generator producing the  electricity.&#160;            </p>
<p>Producing a millimeter size turbine engine also poses some unique  challenges which conventional gas turbines do not face. To understand  some of them we need to understand more about the new MIT millimeter  turbine engine design.</p>

<p>The  millimeter turbine has the same <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s as a macro sized  conventional turbine engine, but their size requires an entirely  different manufacturing technology. According to Professor Epstein,  millimeter sized turbines also have many of the same design  considerations as large turbines including <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> layout, mechanical  stress, oxidation-limit etc. In some respects designing a micro size  turbine is simpler than a conventional macro one since the microrotors  of the turbine are very stiff, eliminating bending problems which occur  on larger rotors. Thermal stress is also not an issue at these sizes as  well as maintenance of any kind (you will never fix a micro turbine but  simply replace the entire engine).&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The millimeter turbine technology is based on <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a>  manufacturing techniques.&#160;This enables the fabrication of complex micro  parts and assemblies &#8211; <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with dimensions in the 1-10,000 micron  size range with submicron precision. Such parts are produced with  photolithographically-defined features and many can be made  simultaneously, offering the promise of low production costs in  large-scale production.&#160;&#160;            </p>

<p>The  main fabrication processes used in the creation of the millimeter  turbine components is etching of photolithographically-defined planar  geometries and bonding of multiple wafers. According to Epstein, the  usual starting point is a flat wafer of the base material, usually  single-crystal <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>. These wafers are typically 0.5 to 1.0 mm thick  and 100 to 300 mm in diameter, the larger size representing a more  modern technology. Dozens to hundreds of micro sized turbine engines  can fit on a single wafer. Ideally, the processing of all the devices  on a wafer is carried out in parallel, leading to one of the great  advantages of this micromachining approach, low unit cost.</p>
<p>First, the wafers are coated with a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-sensitive photoresist. A  high contrast black-and-white <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> defining the <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is then  optically transferred to the resist either by means of a contact  exposure with a glass plate containing the pattern (a &#8220;mask&#8221;), or by  direct optical or e-beam writing. The photoresist is then chemically  developed as though it was photographic film, baked, and then the  exposed areas are removed with a solvent. This leaves bare silicon in  the areas to be etched and photoresist-protected silicon elsewhere. The  etching process is based on the principle that the bare silicon is  etched at a much higher rate, typically 50-100x, than the mask  material. Many different options for making masks have been developed,  including a wide variety of photoresists and various oxide or metal  films. By using several layers of masking material, each sensitive to  different solvents, multi-depth <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s can be defined. Photoresist  on top of SiO2 is one example.&#160;            </p>

<p>The  millimeter size turbine has many possible applications ranging from  <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> to civilian and industrial. The millimeter turbine project in  MIT is currently funded by the U.S. military which sees a great  potential for this upcoming technology. Anything from small unmanned  aerial vehicles (UAVs) to a soldier night scope can be operated by a  tiny refuelable turbine powered by a small protected hydrogen fuel  cartridge. Another interesting possible use of the millimeter turbine  engine is the exoskeleton, a technology currently under development  which will enable future soldiers to carry tremendous weights across  great distances with little effort. Current exoskeleton prototypes  suffer from a range of problems limiting their usefulness. They are  big, heavy, cumbersome and restricting as well as very complex and  expensive to make. Using millimeter turbine engines to power the  exoskeleton can save <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, weight, reduce costs and extend the unit  operational time. If several millimeter engines could also be used to  move the joints of the exoskeleton, and not only be used as a power  source for larger motors, they might also potentially allow for a much  quieter operation (a disadvantage of most existing exoskeleton  <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s).&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>On  the <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> market, millimeter engines could also have a large  variety of applications ranging from refuelable batteries for consumer  products such as laptops, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> cameras and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones, to cheap  micro engines which could be used for agriculture,  Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100323074750/http://www.tfot.info/content/view/111/61/?PHPSESSID=8dfe4cd8a98ed13b6d224c8e6d9e4aaf" target="_blank">MEMS</a>),  sensors and even toys. Although industrial applications such as power  stations made out of large arrays of millimeter size turbine might  still be a distant <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> due to the low efficiency level of the  millimeter engine, It is not inconceivable that in the future more  efficient millimeter engines will be able to allow for a competitive  alternative to existing power manufacturing technology.&#160;&#160;            </p>

<p><strong>Q: When did you start working on the micro gas turbine and what was the initial motivation for the work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Started <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about it 1995.&#160;The motivation was two  factors: (1) realizing that since large gas turbine engines can power a  city, very small ones could power a person's electrical needs; (2) that  <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> offered an approach to getting the manufacturing costs down a  level comparable to the costs per watt of a large engine  ($0.3-0.5/WATT).&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Did you have a Eureka! Moment during the work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. Lot's of hard problems (many not foreseen) have been solved by the very hard work of a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of talented people.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the components of the micro-turbine engine and how will it work after it will be assembled?</strong> </p>

<p>A:  The components are same as large engine, but the assembly is totally  different.&#160;The components are etched from solid Si wafers in  planes.&#160;The wafers are then bonded together to yield a wafer of  complete engines.&#160;The wafers are then cut apart into <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> engines  as needed.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What will be the size of the engine (minimum and maximum sizes based on near term lithography technology)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> lithographic technology is not the limit, rather etching  depth and precision is major <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a> on the large size.&#160;On the small  size end, it is viscous forces in the air which cause the engine  performance to rapidly drop off at sizes smaller than about a  millimeter.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What sort of performance should we expect from the engine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The best metric is <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> per unit weight, about 120-150  w-hr/kg for current commercial Li-ion rechargeable batteries. We expect that 500-700 whr/kg can be accomplished in the near term, rising to 1200-1500 whr/kg in the longer term (for the engine and its fuel supply).&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the micro-engine be capable of refueling (and how will that be accomplished)?</strong> </p>

<p>A:  Yes.&#160;It can readily be refueled.&#160;For example,&#160;as you do a lighter, or  prepackaged fuel cartridges could be used.&#160;This is probably a  commercial question.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you describe the process by which the millimeter engine  will be mass produced (what are the different stages/materials) how  does it differ (if at all) from existing <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> manufacturing techniques?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:&#160; </strong>These engines could be manufactured in a fashion similar  to that of current <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s chips or automotive sensors, either by  new companies or by current chip manufacturers such as Intel or  Siemens, or sensor producers such as Bosch or <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a> Devices.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What were the major problems you faced on this project? What problems you still face?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>There have been few easy challenges but the two most  difficult problems have been (1) understanding the interaction between  manufacturing precision and rotor-bearing performance, and (2) managing  the tradeoff between the design requirements (of the thermodynamics,  combustion, stress, fluid flow, and electromechanics) with complexity  of the manufacturing process.&#160; In other words, how to achieve the  functionality needed in something simple enough to build. This remains  our largest challenge.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: In 2003 you were still struggling with putting the pieces of  the engine together &#8211; where is the research standing at the moment,  what are the obstacles you still face, and what do you predict for the  next five years?</strong> </p>

<p>A:  We hope to get the engine producing power by late spring.&#160;1-2 years  later, a commercial firm should start bringing it to market which may  take 3-5 years.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What will be the first applications of the micro-engine and what will be its price? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> 10-50 watts for high end laptops and military gadgets (MIT  work is sponsored by the US Army). Obviously it must be competitively  priced or will not survive long in the market place.&#160;Detailed pricing  is beyond my competence.</p>

This technology could be of use to steer us away from fossil fuels if the hydrogen (or other renewable fuel eg ethanol or methanol) is produced using renewable energy systems such as wind, solar PV or biomass.
<br>
<br>
However, new energy storage systems are great but we have the technology now to make the transition from fossil to renewable energy. The problem is not logistics or technics it is entirely political and economic in nature.

The vertical lift is due to the evaporative properties (fission) of water freeing the hydrogen bound to oxygen, descent would arise as a property of fusion to maintain viscosity or horizontal motion.

The craft (beit airborne) would have to have a semipermeable membrane for an exterior, such as polymeric silicates (mica) to interact with atmospheric water.

At the micro level you can imagine the atoms bonding creating a lattice to climb. On the macroscale one imagines the light of distant planets and stars magnetically drawing us at speeds beyond any measure of time, as would be noted in light years.

<br>
"Water is the energy source?!" Already wrong! Unless you are speaking of hydroelectric power, or fusion - which I don't think you are - water is definitely not the source, either. Rather, water is merely the source of the FEEDSTOCK, i.e., the thing from which we obtain (at high energy cost, through, e.g., hydrolysis) the energy carrier (i.e, hydrogen.)
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> I do not believe H2O would give us a perpetual energy due to the elliptical nature of the molecule and its right and left handedness. </p></center>
<br>
Well, I don't think that any modern-day researchers are hoping to find a "perpetual energy source." But why, pray tell, should the elliptical nature of the H2O molecule preclude its suitability? And why should its right AND left-handedness be an obstacle?
<br>
<br>
(By the way, I have no idea what you mean by "elliptical nature" or "right AND lefthandedness" in this context, but let's assume that those are generally-known terms, and proceed with the explanation as to why they make H2O unsuitable.)
<br>
<br>

<br>
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize taht you were referring to the well-known fact that the light of distant planets and stars is magnetically drawing us... etc., etc. You obviously have access to some marvelous alien technology which makes all that possible.
<br>
<br>
Carry on.

Hi Redak, hope all is well - 
<br>
<br>
You are absolutely correct here - if it was easy to extract raw hydrogen from H20, we would've abandoned oil long ago. The formation of the water molecule, and it's resulting stability, of course represents a deep energy well which is the energy which raw hydrogen promises.
<br>
<br>
You've been missed, don't stay away so long - you're awesome.</p></td>

I just don't seem to get shed of this forum, so I suppose that we'll be seeing each other around in the future.
<br>
<br>
By the way: What actually was the reason for the hiatus of MindExchange? Was there an official explanation?
<br>
<br>
In any event, the pause doesn't seem to have affected things much. Looks like we've got a fresh crop of conspiracy theorists, moonbats, and assorted nuts.
<br>
<br>
Your continued level-headedness, ruthless skepticism, and influence as the inofficial "voice of reason" of MindExchange are much appreciated.

I would categorize them as belonging to the realm of pseudo-science, wishful thinking, science-fiction, or fringe physics, on a par with hollow-earth theory, phrenology, etc.
<br>
<br>
You seem like an alright chap. You certainly seem well-spoken, so I suppose that I shouldn't be calling you a "kook." But your statements seemed like pure crackpottery. I really didn't mean to offend you, even though I was attempting to subject you to public ridicule and mockery.
<br>
<br>
By the way, just what did you mean when you said that light-years were a measurement of time? I was under the impression that they are, strictly speaking, a unit of length.

Perhaps we are from the same planet. I am also under the impression lightyears equate units of time. Clearly that was not a question. Nor did I imply agreeing with it.
<br>
Refer back to the dream. Difficult it was for me to describe my thought traveling in the light. I can say time was not part of the experience. It did not exist. The following poem I wrote to describe feelings and questions stirred by this dream. The experience left an indelible imprint in daily conscious efforts until which time I composed the following giving me closure.
<br>
<br>
TIME AND SPACE 
<br>
L2=EM if; [(cv) (hv) (1/2mv2)] =L2 
<br>
Equation herein shows factor for the imbalance time cost. 
<br>
Planck's Constant to remind us of the deficit in energy loss. 
<br>
A shift must incorporate the factor of time 
<br>
As dimensions shift insanity will border the line. 
<br>
Time bends light's linear path in curves to spiral reflection amiss 
<br>
Uneven flow projects the shadow of interference or tale of the dark abyss. 
<br>
Man's thought blends reason though his eyes deceive 
<br>
Light bends cloaking the true incidence for reality. 
<br>
To gain knowledge and sense the harmony 
<br>
Earth's sphere is insight to the atomic monopolarity. 
<br>
Light is equal to the harmonic of the frequency and velocity 
<br>
Electromagnetic duality riding parallel in spectral ferocity. 
<br>
Time is the deception as reason finds man 
<br>
With potential energy in need of reprimand. 
<br>
In this, the creation and regeneration of all life  
<br>
Eludes to time's equation the maker of strife. 
<br>
Allow time's treason considering the mass and space 
<br>
The energy is adequate in mirror of the atoms true face.
<br>
<br>
TIME MEASURES THE DEGREE OF DEFICIT IN THE SPEED OF LIGHT. SHADOWS OF CONTAINED REST ENERGY EXPRESS ALL VARIABLES AND ISOLATE THE DIFFERENTIAL. TIME IS EQUAL TO THE CONTAINED REST MASS OBSTRUCTING LIGHT'S POTENTIAL.
<br>
<br>
Any attempt to publicly mock or ridicule me would have no impact. I am not concerned with negative actions as my life experience has already taught me how not to re ACT.
<br>
We each have our perspectives based on experience...in that is the right for everyone to express those beliefs.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
A micro turbine designed for DARPA by M-Dot
<br>
Also known as:
<br>
Turbo alternators
<br>
MicroTurbine (registered trademark of Capstone Turbine Corporation)
<br>
Turbogenerator (registered tradename of Honeywell Power Systems, Inc.)
<br>
Microturbines are becoming widespread for distributed power and combined heat and power applications. They are one of the most promising technologies for powering hybrid electric vehicles. They range from hand held units producing less than a kilowatt, to commercial sized systems that produce tens or hundreds of kilowatts.
<br>
Part of their success is due to advances in electronics, which allows unattended operation and interfacing with the commercial power grid. Electronic power switching technology eliminates the need for the generator to be synchronized with the power grid. This allows the generator to be integrated with the turbine shaft, and to double as the starter motor.
<br>
Microturbine systems have many advantages over reciprocating engine generators, such as higher power density (with respect to footprint and weight), extremely low emissions and few, or just one, moving part. Those designed with foil bearings and air-cooling operate without oil, coolants or other hazardous materials. Microturbines also have the advantage of having the majority of their waste heat contained in their relatively high temperature exhaust, whereas the waste heat of recriprocating engines is split between its exhaust and cooling system.[4] However, reciprocating engine generators are quicker to respond to changes in output power requirement and are usually slightly more efficient, although the efficiency of microturbines is increasing. Microturbines also lose more efficiency at low power levels than reciprocating engines.
<br>
They accept most commercial fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, propane, diesel, and kerosene as well as renewable fuels such as E85, biodiesel and biogas.
<br>
Microturbine designs usually consist of a single stage radial compressor, a single stage radial turbine and a recuperator. Recuperators are difficult to design and manufacture because they operate under high pressure and temperature differentials. Exhaust heat can be used for water heating, space heating, drying processes or absorption chillers, which create cold for air conditioning from heat energy instead of electric energy.
<br>
Typical microturbine efficiencies are 25 to 35%. When in a combined heat and power cogeneration system, efficiencies of greater than 80% are commonly achieved.
<br>
MIT started its millimeter size turbine engine project in the middle of the 1990s when Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Alan H. Epstein considered the possibility of creating a personal turbine which will be able to meet all the demands of a modern person's electrical needs, just like a large turbine can meet the electricity demands of a small city. According to Professor Epstein current commercial Li-ion rechargeable batteries deliver about 120-150 Wh/kg. MIT's millimeter size turbine will deliver 500-700 Wh/kg in the near term, rising to 1200-1500 Wh/kg in the longer term.[5]</p></td>
