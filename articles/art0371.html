<p>Originally published January 2, 2002 on KurzweilAI.net.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Why is it that our computers have no grasp of ordinary life? Wouldn't it be great if your <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> knew enough about life so that it could conclude that when you typed in "<i>a gift for my brother"</i>, it knew that because he had just moved into his first apartment that he could probably use some new furniture? Or if your cell phone knew enough about emergencies that, even though you had silenced it in the movie theater, it could know to ring if your mother were to call from the hospital? Or if your <a class="thought" href="entries/pda_entry.html">personal digital assistant</a> knew enough about people that it could know to cancel a hiking trip with a friend who had just broken a leg?</p>
<p>Despite years of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, building machines that can think about ordinary things the way any average person can is still out of reach. To be sure, computers can now do many remarkable things. Recent increases in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power have allowed many years of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> to bear fruit. We now have programs that can play chess at the level of the very best players, that can solve the logistics problems of coordinating the most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> deployments, and that can help us engineer the most intricate <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chips to the most complex airplane engines. There is no doubt that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> has come into its own as a successful field with many practical applications.</p>
<p>Yet how is it that we can write <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that can do such complex things as design airplane engines, but still we cannot build machines that can look at a typical photograph and describe what is in it, or that can read the simplest children's story and answer questions about it? We have been able to write programs that exceed the capabilities of experts, yet we have not been able to write programs that match the level of a three year old child at recognizing objects, understanding sentences, or drawing the simplest conclusions about ordinary life. Why is it that we can't seem to make computers that can think about the world as any person can?</p>
<p>The problem seems not to be that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists lack ideas about how to write programs that can <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> and solve problems. The field of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is a veritable gold mine of techniques. There are programs that can successfully diagnose medical symptoms, analyze and repair problems in space craft, plan the best route for your rental car to your desired destination, and transcribe speech into text. Each of these technologies employs a different type of reasoning <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>, and there are many more methods out there. We certainly do need new ideas about the mechanisms that underlie intelligent behavior. But it seems more likely that we have more than enough ideas about the ingredients of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and that the real problem lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>The real problem is that computers do not know anything about us! Our machines lack <i>common sense</i> -- all that ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that people in our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> share, things we understand so well we hardly even realize we know them. Computers do not know what we look like, how we typically behave, or what we are capable of. They do not know anything about the patterns of people's lives, the places we spend our time, or the kinds of relationships we have with each other. They know nothing of our hopes and fears, the things we like and the things we loathe, or the feelings and emotions that motivate and underlie everything we do. By giving computers ways to represent and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about people, they can be made to become helpful and eager participants in the human world.</p><h1>Computers lack <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a></h1><p>Why has it been so hard to give computers this <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, the ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> about our ordinary goals and concerns? Why are we able to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> machines like <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>, that can beat the greatest chess players that have ever lived, yet we are not able to give computers the <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> that gives them the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> abilities of a five year old child? Listen to <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> in his book <u>The </u><u>Society</u><u> of </u><u>Mind</u><u>:</u>
</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a>: The mental skills that most people share. Commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is actually more complex than many of the intellectual accomplishments that attract more attention and respect, because the mental skills we call "expertise" often engage large amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> but usually employ only a few types of representations. In contrast, <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> involves many kinds of representations and thus requires a larger range of different skills.</blockquote>
<p>In other words, giving computers <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> is the opposite of the problem <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> researchers have traditionally faced. Rather than it being a problem of how to give computers a great deal of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about how to think about some particular area such as chess playing or <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> design, to give computers <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> we must <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> them with <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about many different areas: physical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how objects behave, social <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how people interact, sensory <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how things look and taste, psychological <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the way people think, and more. Furthermore, each of these different facets of life requires its own specialized methods of reasoning about them. Giving computers <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> is not about figuring how to make some particular <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of reasoning work over a particular type of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, it is about how to make systems that are abundant with many types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and many ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about different things. There are two parts to this problem:</p>
<p>The first problem is how to give computers <i>commonsense </i><i>knowledge</i><i>,</i> the millions of ordinary pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that every person learns by adulthood. Many of these are so obvious we take them for granted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every person is younger than the person's mother</li>
<li>A butcher is unlikely to be a vegetarian</li>
<li>People do not like being repeatedly interrupted</li>
<li>If you hold a knife by its blade then the blade may cut you</li>
<li>If you drop paper into a flame then the paper will burn</li>
<li>You start getting hungry again a few hours after eating a meal</li>
<li>People pay taxi drivers to drive them places</li>
<li>People go to parties to meet new people</li>
<li>People generally sleep at night</li>
</ul>
<p>We know many millions of such commonsense things, the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the world that most people in our culture share, and each of these pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is probably represented in the brain in several different ways.</p>
<p>The second problem is how to give computers the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for <i>commonsense reasoning,</i> ways to use this commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to solve the various problems we encounter every day, large and small. Having a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of millions of facts is not enough by itself (although we cannot do without it!) In addition to this sort of factual <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the world, we need to give computers many different ways of using that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to think: different methods of reasoning, planning, explaining, predicting, and all the other kinds mental skills we use for getting along. Some examples of the kinds of things we do when we think include these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>If you have a problem, think of a past situation where you solved a similar problem</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>If you take an </i><i>action</i><i>, anticipate what might happen next</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>If you fail at something, imagine how you might have done things differently</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>If you observe an event, try to infer what prior event might have caused it</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>If you see an </i><i>object</i><i>, wonder if anyone owns it</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>If someone does something, ask yourself what the person's purpose was in doing that</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of things are themselves a type of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, not about the outside world but about the world inside the mind. This <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is about ways to use other kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, in order to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> about the world in a way that helps us effectively navigate the problems of daily life.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common sense</a> is really the all those things that lets a person <i>think like a person,</i> which people are able to do because our brains are vast libraries of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and methods for organizing, acquiring, and using such <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common sense</a> is a problem of great scale and <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a></h1><p>How big is <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>? The scale of the problem has been terribly discouraging. Those courageous few who have tried have found that you need a tremendous amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of a very diverse variety to understand even the simplest children's story. Many researchers regard the problem of giving computers <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> as simply too <i>big</i> to think about.</p>
<p>There have been several attempts to estimate how much commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> people have. These attempts range from experiments that demonstrate that people can only acquire new long-term memories at a the rate of a few bits per second, to counting the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of words we know and estimating how much we know about each word, to estimating the brain's storage <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> by counting neurons and guessing at how many bits each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> can store. Several of these estimates produce approximately the same <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, suggesting there are on the order of <i>hundreds of millions</i> of pieces of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>This is a huge <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>. What can we do, given that there is so much <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> out there that we need to give our machines? Is there anything we can do to accelerate the process of teaching computers all this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>? Building a robot that lives in the world and learns like a real child might eventually be made to work, and it is in fact a popular idea today to try to build such a "baby <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>". But to date no one has figured out how to build <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> programs that can learn the broad range of things that a child can, and that can keep on <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> without getting stuck.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be one that was noted many years ago by <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> pioneer <a class="thought" href="entries/mccarthy_entry.html">John McCarthy</a>: <i>In order for a </i><i>program</i><i> to be capable of </i><i>learning</i><i> something, it must first be capable of being told it.</i> We do not yet have enough ideas about how to represent, organize, and use much of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, let alone build a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that could learn all of that automatically on its own. There are many romantics who believe that this kind of prior understanding is not necessary to build a baby <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can be made to emerge from some generic <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. But in our view, unless we can acquire some <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in manually engineering systems with <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, we will not be able to build <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> machines that can automatically learn <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>. So we must bite the bullet, and make a manual attempt to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>. This is a problem as large as any other that has been faced in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> to date.</p>
<p>There has been one major attempt to manually build a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of human <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> project led by researcher <a class="thought" href="entries/lenat_entry.html">Doug Lenat</a>. Many people regard Lenat as foolhardy for taking on such a grand challenge, but to us he is doubly a hero -- first, for having the courage to attempt this project at all, and second, for standing up to his critics over the years and persisting in the face of all that criticism. <a class="thought" href="entries/lenat_entry.html">Doug Lenat</a> and his team of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> engineers have worked for nearly two decades, at the cost of many tens of millions of dollars, painstakingly building up what is now a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of 1.5 million pieces of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>But as much as we admire the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> project, 1.5 million pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is still terribly far away from several hundred million. The <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> project faces a challenge no single team could expect to succeed at. And indeed, they themselves admit they are still one or two orders of magnitude away from what is needed. We believe that a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> this large simply cannot be engineered by any one group.</p><h1>Turning to the general public</h1><p>Is there a solution to this problem of scale? We believe that there is, based on one critical observation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every ordinary person has <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> of the kind we want to give our machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advent of the web has made it possible for the first time for thousands or even millions of people to collaborate to construct systems that no single <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> or team could build. These types of projects are known as <i>distributed human projects</i>. An early and very successful example was the Open Directory Project, a <a class="thought" href="entries/yahoo_entry.html">Yahoo</a>-like directory of several million web sites that was built by tens of thousands of topic editors distributed across the web. The very difficult problem of organizing and categorizing the web was effectively solved by distributing the work across thousands of volunteers across the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Could the problem of giving computers <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> be cast in the same way, where thousands of people with no special training in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> could participate in building the bulk of the <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>? Over a hundred million people have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the web. If each of them contributed just one piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, the problem could be solved!</p>
<p>Of course, it is easier said than done. But if this is indeed possible, then the reward would be tremendous -- we would finally be able to solve this problem of giving computers <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, making them far more understanding and useful than they are today. If we can find good ways to acquire <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> from people by asking them questions, presenting them with lines of reasoning to confirm or repair, asking them to tell stories about everyday life, and so on, we may be able to accumulate the many of the types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> needed to give our machines the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for commonsense reasoning. Even if we could only partly solve the problem this way, we would be a long way toward our goal.</p><h1>Supporting thousands of on-line volunteers with Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a></h1><p>Could you build a web site that makes it fun and easy for everyone to collaborate and help teach computers about the everyday world? With this goal in mind, we built a web site called Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a>, which is located at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100528132011/http://www.openmind.org/commonsense" target="_new">www.openmind.org/commonsense</a>. This web site has been running since the fall of 2000, and so far we have gathered many hundreds of thousands of pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from over eight thousand people. This is still only a quarter of what is in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a>, but we acquired this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in a fraction of the time and at a tiny fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a> is a kind of second-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>. We learned much from <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a>, but as we were inspired by <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a>, we wanted to do things in a different way. After all, why are there not four or five <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> sized projects in the world, each taking a different approach to attacking the critical problem of giving computers more <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>? How could we approach the <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> problem differently? In the following sections I will discuss in more detail our general approach in the Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a> project.</p><h1>We need many types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and ways to represent that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a></h1><p>One of the first questions we faced in this project was how to <i>represent</i> the <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> acquired from people. There have been many disagreements in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> over this question. One popular view is that we should try to write down <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in the form of <i>rules</i>, things such as "if you are in a gravitational field, and you are holding an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, and you let go of the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, then that <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> will fall down." Of course, every rule has its exceptions, but this approach has proven useful in building many practical reasoning systems.</p>
<p>Others have argued that more "concrete" representations, such as stories or descriptions of situations, are the right way to represent commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. In that approach, in order to solve a problem, you would look up a story or situation where you solved a similar problem, and do what you did then. For example, you might have the story "Bob was hungry. Bob ate a sandwich. Bob was less hungry." Then if you were hungry and wanted to be come less hungry, you would be reminded of that story and get the idea that it might be useful to make a sandwich.</p>
<p>Still others have argued that much of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> is less about "<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>" than it is simply routine behaviors that operate using less explicit types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, for example the kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> we use to walk around. Much of what we know seems to be implicit in this way, yet it is as much a part of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> as the more explicit types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> we can more easily articulate.</p>
<p>Our view is that when it comes to <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, <i>diversity</i> is the secret to success. It is not so much a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of choosing between such representations as it is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of finding way for them to work together in one <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Not only do we need many kinds of representations, we need many types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. To cope with the broad range of problems that can people solve, we need <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of a very diverse variety: spatial, physical, social, tactile, emotional, bodily, economic, and so on. The more types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> available, the more likely it is you will have the appropriate type of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to solve whatever commonsense problem you are faced with at the moment. For example, to understand the simple sentence "John saw the movie with Susan at the theater", you need to use all these types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and many more:</p>
<ul>
<li>John was sitting near Susan while they watched the movie (<i>spatial</i>)</li>
<li>John and Susan spent some money on tickets (<i>economic</i>)</li>
<li>John and Susan know each other and are probably friends (<i>social</i>)</li>
<li>John and his chair were in contact during the movie (<i>tactile</i>)</li>
<li>Susan's body was in a sitting posture during the movie (<i>bodily</i>)</li>
</ul><h1>The types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> gathered by Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a></h1><p>A large part of building a commonsense knowledgebase is identifying the types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that are needed to solve different types of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> problems. For each identifiable type of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, it might be possible to construct a web page specially designed to acquire that type of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. And furthermore it might be possible to acquire that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> so that people untrained in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> could supply it.</p>
<p>To this end, we constructed a variety of activities for gathering <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Each activity tries to make it simple for the user to teach a certain kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. At present we have about 25 activities. Some of the kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> we collect include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What sorts of things are there? (<i>Cats are mammals.)</i>
</li>
<li>What are the likely effects of an <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>? (<i>Eating a sandwich makes you less hungry.)</i>
</li>
<li>What sorts of things do people want and not want? (<i>People want to be warm.)</i>
</li>
<li>Where are things typically found? (<i>You often find a hairdryer in a bathroom.)</i>
</li>
<li>What are objects for? (<i>Chairs are for sitting on.)</i>
</li>
<li>How do you solve problems? (<i>If you want to be less hungry, eat a sandwich.)</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to acquire this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is by giving people explicit templates to fill in, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hammer is for ________</li>
<li>People want ________</li>
<li>The effect of eating a sandwich is ________</li>
<li>Somewhere you find a bed is ________</li>
<li>A typical activity is <i>________</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way is to give people simple stories and ask them to type in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in a freeform way:</p>
<ul>
<li>User is prompted with story:</li>
<ul>
<li>Bob had a cold.</li>
<li>Bob went to the doctor.</li>
</ul>
<li>User enters many kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in response:</li>
<ul>
<li>Bob was feeling sick</li>
<li>Bob wanted to feel better</li>
<li>The doctor made Bob feel better</li>
<li>People with colds sneeze</li>
<li>The doctor wore a stethoscope around his neck</li>
<li>A stethoscope is a piece of medical equipment</li>
<li>The doctor might have worn a white coat</li>
<li>A doctor is a highly trained professional</li>
<li>You can help a sick person with <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>
</li>
<li>A sneezing person is probably sick</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>We also collect <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that is larger than can be expressed in single sentences. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Concrete situations:</i> We have our users supply descriptions of photos in plain English:</li>
<ul>
<li>Example: <i>A mother is holding her baby. The baby is smiling. They are looking into each other's eyes. The baby is happy. The mother is happy.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<i>Concrete episodes</i>. We have our users supply stories, either to illustrate some existing fact like "flashlight light up places" or in response to a given title like "going outside at night":</li>
<ul>
<li>Example: <i>It was too dark to see. I went and got my flashlight. I turned on my flashlight. I could see much better.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<i>Visual events.</i> To allow more sophisticated forms of spatial reasoning, we allow users to annotate movies of simple iconic spatial events. Our goal is eventually to learn translation rules that let us produce event descriptions from movies and vice versa. This is a first step toward reasoning with pictures as well as with sentences.</li>
<ul>
<li>Example: <i>The small red ball rolls past the big blue ball.</i>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This list only scratches the surface.</p><h1>A modern attempt to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> can start with <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a></h1><p>Aside from our targeting the general public, the other major difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> and Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a> is that we have asked our users to supply <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in plain English sentences. <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> expresses all <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in CycL, a precise but difficult <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> in which it is possibly to state facts clearly and unambiguously, which makes it easier for computers to manipulate and use. We considered using CycL or something like it in Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a>, but decided the average web user would have little interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> a whole new <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to participate in our project. Using English as the representation may require using a simplified version of the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, but may be the only way to allow a wide range of people to participate in the project.</p>
<p>One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to believe English input is a good idea is that modern <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> processing techniques are now good enough to extract the correct syntactic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> from a large proportion of the sentences people have supplied to our <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. And even if we cannot build a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can understand every sentence users enter right now, over time we can develop better and more accurate ways to represent the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> expressed in each statement.</p>
<p>Also, as pointed out earlier, one thing that distinguishes <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> from other types of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is the range of types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that are needed. We wanted to gather <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of many different types. No simple and easily learned <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> could possibly represent all the types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that someone might express in an English sentence. Any invented <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> would need to be at least as complex as English to express the range of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> we were seeking.</p>
<p>There are problems with using English. The main <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that English is regarded as too unwieldy a representation is that vagueness and ambiguity pervade English, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> reasoning systems generally require <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to be expressed accurately and precisely. But in our view, ambiguity is unavoidable when trying to represent the commonsense world. The core of the problem is that different people simply do not agree on the boundaries of ideas. One person's <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a "vacation" will differ from the next person's. So if you want to take a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_engineering_entry.html">knowledge engineering</a> approach where many people enter <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> into a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> -- which is true of <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> as well, though they use fewer people -- then you need a way to compensate for the fact that people have different ideas in their heads. The precision of most <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> languages may in fact be a problem for any approach that attempts to acquire <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from people. If ambiguity cannot be avoided, then we must learn to cope with it. So why not build on <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>?</p><h1>Using the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> we have gathered</h1><p>How can we use the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that we have gathered? We can build <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to help us in everyday life by actually understanding everyday life. At the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, we are exploring several kinds of applications. For example, we have built a <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> application that uses commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> about the true goal behind the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> query. When the user types "<i>my cat is sick</i>" into the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> reasons, roughly, that</p>
<ul>
<li>People care about their pets</li>
<ul>
<li>&amp; People want their pets to be healthy</li>
<li>&amp; My cat is my pet</li>
<li>&amp; I want my cat to be healthy</li>
<li>&amp; A veterinarian heals sick pets</li>
<li>&amp; A veterinarian makes sick pets healthy</li>
<li>&amp; I want to call a veterinarian</li>
<li>&amp; A veterinarian is a local service</li>
</ul>
<li>Therefore: <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a> for a veterinarian in the user's area</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> reasons that what the user really wants is for their cat to be healthy, and therefore they should seek a nearby veterinarian. None of the popular web <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> engines presently engage in this kind of reasoning about people's <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> queries.</p>
<p>Another application being developed by researcher Barbara Barry is what you might call an intelligent video camera. Before people go to shoot an event with a camera, they have a good idea of what might happen at the event. But most of the time, they become so engaged with what they are looking at through the lens that they forget the types of shots that later would later convey a good story about the event to another person. They shoot a lot of pictures or video and when they get back to the desktop there are holes in their story. Retrieving <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> about events can give the filmmaker a list of shots to take in order to build a complete story. Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> can be used for shot suggestions, to make sure the maker has the ingredients to construct a coherent story. For example, here are some things that a marathon runner does, which could be seen as a simple list of shots that a person with a camera could capture during a marathon to tell a story about it in pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Things found at a marathon: Crowds, runners, finish line, wheelchair racers, and paramedics</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>A marathon runner eats pasta the day before the race</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>A marathon runner gets their </i><i>number</i><i> at the starting line</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>A marathon runner runs from the starting point to the finish line</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>A marathon runner gets tired during the race</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>A marathon runner will be very happy if they win the race</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>People hand cups of water to marathon runners during the race</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>The effect of winning a marathon is that the audience cheers</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another application, under development by Henry Lieberman and his students Kim Waters and Hugo Liu, is <i>Aria</i>, a photo retrieval <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that retrieves relevant photos as you are typing an e-mail to someone. For example, let's say you have gone to your friend Mary's wedding and have taken a bunch of pictures which you have partly annotated. The following day you are writing an e-mail to another friend about the event. You type "I finally got to meet Mary's sister Judy." Even if you have no photos labeled "Judy", you would like to retrieve the photo "Mary and her bridesmaids." This is an example of where <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> is useful. If you knew that "At a typical wedding, the bridesmaid is often the sister of the bride", then the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> might realize that photo was relevant, and suggest inserting it into the E-mail. Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> knows a lot about typical events such as weddings. Here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>A bride wears a wedding gown</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Weddings usually have parties afterwards</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>A wedding ring is usually worn on the left hand</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Weddings often happen at chapels</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Wedding photographers are expensive to hire</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Something that is found at a wedding are the bride and the groom</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, we would like for such applications themselves to drive the acquisition of further <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> makes some strange inference, the user can correct it, because they are motivated by the desire to improve the application. Or when the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> fails to make an inference, they can add <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> so that next time it will make it.</p><h1>Achieving robustness through a <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a> reasoning methods</h1><p>How can we <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> we have acquired? We have explored using both rule-based and <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>-based methods of reasoning. For example, we have found that a combination of facts expressed in English and rules that match those facts can give us a simple way of reasoning with the data we have collected. It is difficult to produce only correct conclusions with these kinds of simple techniques, but for the applications we have explored, web <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> and photo retrieval, we have found that we do not need the kinds of accuracy that is needed in, say, building a medical reasoning <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, people make mistakes. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> reasoning is both unsound (we produce wrong conclusions from correct assumptions) and incomplete (we do not draw a conclusion even when it is "obvious" from the evidence.) This point has been powerfully demonstrated by the child psychologist <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a>, who has shown that children do not just lack <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about the world, but that they lack the ability to make proper inferences given what they know. Reasoning logically seems to be a skill that some people learn as they get older, but even adults fail to draw the correct conclusions when asked questions like "If most Canadians have brown eyes, and most brown eyed people have good eyesight, then do most Canadians have good eyesight?" You might guess yes, but in fact this is not true. (Imagine a world where most people have brown eyes and good eyesight, except for that small group of brown eyed Canadians!)</p>
<p>Yet, soundness and completeness are two of the most sought after properties researchers seek in building their inference systems. Of course these properties are desirable much of the time. You would not want your medical <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> making the wrong diagnoses. These methods have their place in building systems that, in narrow areas, engage in more robust reasoning than any human could.</p>
<p>But the trouble is that soundness and completeness requires carefully engineering our assumptions and rules of inference to prevent problems and conflicts, and while this may be possible in narrower domains of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, it is unclear that we can ever achieve such perfection in the large commonsense systems we hope to build. No one has been able to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can achieve the robustness of human reasoning in the commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>. We need to give up on romantic dreams of pristine properties of soundness and completeness, and instead find ways to use databases that contain <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that has errors and biases, and use inference methods that are unsound. To scale up, we need to develop ways of reasoning where errors can be cancelled out or corrected by other <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>One idea we are fond of is that there are always multiple ways to make any particular argument. No single argument is always completely reliable. However, we think it is possible to improve the robustness of reasoning by combining multiple types of arguments. We have been exploring the idea that you can combine multiple inferences to produce a single, more robust inference. Robustness would come from combining multiple types of arguments, much as a table can be made to support a large weight not by giving it a single very strong leg, but by giving it many less strong legs that together can support more than any one leg could. And to continue the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, some of those legs might even be broken (just as <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and reasoning might be inaccurate) and yet the table could still stand up.</p><h1>We need new kinds of architectures for building systems with <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a></h1><p>We believe that commonsense databases will soon be ubiquitous. One way or the other, through directly acquiring <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from people, reading the web, or making use of robots that can see and touch things, we will find ways to acquire <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> about the world. But databases of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> by themselves are not enough to build systems with human-level <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> abilities. Adding a few types of reasoning methods helps, but this is still not enough. We need to develop new kinds of <i>architectures</i> -- large-scale ways to organize and use <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> -- to use commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Perhaps this is best illustrated by this scenario <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> describes in his book <u>The </u><u>Emotion</u><u> </u><u>Machine</u>:</p>
<blockquote>Joan is part way across the street on the way to present her finished report. While <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about what to say at the meeting, she hears a sound and turns her head --and sees a quickly oncoming car. Uncertain whether to cross or retreat, but uneasy about arriving late, she decides to sprint across the road. She later remembers her injured knee and reflects upon her impulsive decision. "If my knee had failed, I could have been killed. Then what would my friends have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of me?</blockquote>
<p>Minsky suggests that many kinds of thoughts go through Joan's mind during this event:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Reaction: She reacted rapidly to that sound.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Representation: She constructed descriptions of things and ideas.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Attention: She noticed certain things rather than others.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Decision: She selected among alternative options.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Meta-Decision: She selected some method for choosing those options.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Embodiment: She was partly aware of her body's condition.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Intention: She formulated some goals and plans.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Language: She heard words or dialogs in her mind.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Imagining: She envisioned some alternative possible futures.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Planning: She considered various action-plans.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Reasoning: She constructed various arguments.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Recollection: She constructed descriptions of past events.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Identity: She regarded herself as an entity.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Reflection: She thought about what has she recently done.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Moral Reflection: She reflected upon what she ought to have done.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Self-Reflection: She reflected on what she was recently thinking.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Self-Imaging: She engaged certain models that she's made of herself.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Social Reflection: She considered what others might think about her.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i>Self-Awareness: She recognized some of her mental conditions.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Joan, a commonsense reasoning <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will need to operate on all these levels. No single type of inference strategy, such as the application of a rule or the making of an <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, is by itself up to the task of commonsense reasoning. The problem is not so much that these methods are not useful -- on the contrary, they will form the foundation of any <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that attempts to do commonsense reasoning. The problem is that even the most ordinary inferences may involve some combination of several different types of reasoning. The solution is to find ways to combine many kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and reasoning strategies to make more complex inferences than any <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> strategy could make.</p>
<p>The problem of building architectures for <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> is, we believe, technically one of the most interesting challenges faced in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. It is a problem of a fundamentally different type from other problems in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. It is not so much about how to invent a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> for solving some simple problem. It is about how to use many kinds of methods together to solve hard and often poorly defined problems. But this is still a poorly understood area -- how do you manage and coordinate multiple types of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> processes? The solution to this problem may not be to embed it within the <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> itself. No simple way of arranging the elements of a commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could possibly secure that all inference within it is productive and sound. Instead, we need to find ways to build systems into the mind that are experts at reflecting on, coordinating, and managing other <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-based processes.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of commonsense systems</h1><p>We believe that the first systems to which people will <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> interesting human-like <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will result from finding ways to use and apply databases of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and that the best way to acquire these databases is through large collaborative efforts. Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a> is really a first attempt at realizing the idea that we might distribute the problem of constructing a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>. We are now working on a second-generation version of the web site. The new site will focus on acquiring more structured forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and will support more activities to repair and organize the existing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. We also hope to forge a greater connection to the existing <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>.</p>
<p>We expect similar projects to Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common Sense</a> to appear, perhaps taking very different approaches. Perhaps someone will build a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that will try to read the text on the web, but will have people help it comprehend the more difficult passages. Also, these days many people have web cameras attached to their computers. You could imagine a more visually-oriented version of Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> where thousands of people helped teach their computers to recognize the appearance and behavior of various kinds of objects. And we need not limit ourselves to the web. Everyone has a cell phone these days, which will soon come equipped with more powerful onboard computers, cameras, and global positioning systems. We could all start to teach computers the patterns of our everyday lives by letting them see and hear us as we actually do things in the world. There is a goldmine of opportunity for people who are willing to accept that there are countless people out there who would be willing to participate as volunteers in the effort to help <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> researchers achieve their dream of bringing a new kind of life form into this world, the class of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Push Singh's Open Mind project is a valuable attempt at bringing up the common sense topic under discussion and scrunity, and for that I commend him. Marvin Minsky himself often says that there should be more researchers investigating this complex and often neglected problem.
<br>
<br>
However, Singh's approach suffers from the very same drawbacks of the Cyc project and all other projects that are based on explicit representation of knowledge: they all seem to be concerned with the tip of a very big iceberg (this issue is developed in Navega 2000).
<br>
<br>
Although common sense may sometimes be represented by natural language expressions or by predicate calculus, it is essential to distinguish between public representations and the  internal semantics of an intelligent agent. The former is something that arises from an effort of convention among communicative agents. But the latter is built inside each agent, and is often the result of sub-symbolic operations (Harnad 1990). And for this to happen, it is necessary to define what is the environment in which the agent is immersed and what is the bodily relation of this agent with its surroundings (Clark 1997).
<br>
<br>
Common sense seems to be an emergent property of a system that builds its own private representations based on its own constructive interpretation of sensory and perceptual experiences. These internal representations must be developed by the agent itself, not by one external "knowledge programmer" (neither, for that matter, by millions of them). 
<br>
<br>
When a human engineer enters a natural language phrase into a software program she is in fact coding the tip of this large iceberg. All the semantic notions which supports this phrase is "below the surface" and is exactly what drives us to say that *she* has common sense. However, this common sense *is not* transferred by the coding of those phrases. It remains inside the human engineer, even if its external symbolic representation makes its way toward another computational device.
<br>
<br>
Although I largely agree with Singh's evaluation of the historic trend of AI (failures and successes) I beg to differ in respect to the proposed solutions to common sense and AI in general. 
<br>
<br>
In my vision there's no way other than starting with a system that has infant-like abilities. And exactly for this reason, AI systems should concern themselves with the kind of cognitive abilities displayed by infants a few months old (see for example, Saffran et al. 1996, Marcus et al. 1999, Gomez &amp; Gerken 1999, Mandler 1988, Marcus 2001, etc.). 
<br>
<br>
In summary, I believe that the AI community should review its short-term goals. Instead of trying to build systems that display common sense or natural language understanding or logical reasoning, one should begin with a system capable of acquiring statistical invariances from simple signals, the way 7-month-olds do (by the way: I'm not a connectionist!). Such a system may spurt an invaluable stream of new ideas, ideas that may lead us to a successful enterprise, because it will follow the only path that we know for sure will lead us to an intelligent organism: our own mind.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I like this (Sergio's) take on the problem.  Words are just ways of encoding concepts that reflect a person's map of the world.  A map that was built up, step-by-step over a lifetime of trial and experience.  A single word can represent a large portion of the map as it exists in the mind of the speaker.  
<br>
<br>
When I say "New York" it encompases everything I have ever come to associate with New York.  There is no way the AI I say it to or type it to can understand that.  The only reason other people can is because we share, through news, movies, TV, school and countless conversations, pretty much the same information and ideas about New York.  Where our views on the subject differ, we misunderstand each other.  To someone who has never been exposed to these views and ideas, the word will have sound but no meaning.  
<br>
<br>
If I say to you, for instance, "xin jiang," what image does it bring to your mind?  If I say to you, "Ass hole!," it arouses certain emotions in your mind and body based on past experience.  But if I say, "Wang ba dan!" I doubt it stirs anything in either your mind or body.  
<br>
<br>
No matter what you say to an AI, it isn't likely to stir anything but a recording of sound data.  The data will have no interest or meaning to it.  The AI has to live in the sense that people live in order to function and understand in the way people do.  That means acquiring experience over time and trying to understand the world in which it lives.  Without that, it won't understand words that refer to that world.  To understand is to associate the words with the experience they refer to.  No experience = no understanding.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think one of the most important things you said (previous post) is
<br>
<br>
"that means acquiring experience over time and trying to understand the world in which it lives. Without that, it won't understand words that refer to that world."
<br>
<br>
I think the key here is "trying to understand the world".  If an AI wants to understand the world the way we do, it needs to actually "try", ie, seek to make sense of the world, reflect on what it knows, and use that knowledge in future interactions.  You can't just let the world "wash over" an AI and expect it all to sink in.  Children learn through experimentation in all things.  An AI would need to trial-and-error learn socially, spacially, conceptually, etc, to think like us.  If we want an AI to have the commonsense  knowledge not to fart at the dinner table, it would have to squirm through the embarrasment of doing just that at the age of three, and getting reprimanded by mum and dad in front of the guests.
<br>
Also, I think there should be some separation between "Artificial Intelligence" and "Artificial Human-like intelligence".  The first is probably far more useful, though you would have to accept that AI would need to have a good sense of the human outlook on life, even if it had its own unique, machine-like intelligence system for understanding the world.  Being less subjective, it may be superior to the "ARtificial Human Like Intelligence", which, if given a base set of human-like insincts and needs to fulfil and pushed into the world, may end up just like us - narrow minded, jaded, self indulgent, superstitious, etc, all the things we might *not* want it to do with its time given the huge investment of resources into the project up to that point.  
<br>
<br>
In regard to the article then, I think the common sense method has some validity in that to understand human motivation, or to interpret what humans are really on about, an AI needs to have some "common sense".  I disagree that this is just a million and one facts though.  Even babies who first learn to crawl won't crawl of the edge of a cliff deliberately (even though they may get dangerously close and *accidently* fall over).   This is not due to an acquired piece of common sense knowledge - it's an inbuilt reflex, like suckling, pre-wired into their brain, that can be applied to a whole range of situations, without mentally ticking off the 'facts about cliffs' sheet that the "commonsense list" AI would.  The top-town commonsense building approach might be useful in helping machine to interact in seemingly intelligent ways with human beings, but i don't think there is any merit in going down this road to create an 'intelligent' machine.
<br>
<br>
anyway, that's my two bits.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Language is inherently evocative, not concrete.
<br>
<br>
&gt; All the semantic notions which supports this phrase is "below the surface" and is exactly what drives us to say that *she* has common sense. However, this common sense *is not* transferred by the coding of those phrases. It remains inside the human engineer, even if its external symbolic representation makes its way toward another computational device. 
<br>
<br>
Predicate logic does allow PART of the modeling that humans do, to have grounding in a computer.
<br>
<br>
&gt; In summary, I believe that the AI community should review its short-term goals. Instead of trying to build systems that display common sense or natural language understanding or logical reasoning, one should begin with a system capable of acquiring statistical invariances from simple signals, the way 7-month-olds do (by the way: I'm not a connectionist!). Such a system may spurt an invaluable stream of new ideas, ideas that may lead us to a successful enterprise, because it will follow the only path that we know for sure will lead us to an intelligent organism: our own mind. 
<br>
<br>
I agree. Pattern completion and pattern inter-relation need more study.</p></td>

It is also true that symbols and tacit concepts stored in a brain can revivify the sensory experience that initially accompanied or produced them. So, I don't find a reason to say that sensory experience cannot be stored or symbolized.

&gt; It is also true that symbols and tacit concepts stored in a brain can revivify the sensory experience that initially accompanied or produced them. So, I don't find a reason to say that sensory experience cannot be stored or symbolized. 
<br>
&gt; 
<br>
&gt; The interpretation occurs based on the pre-existing cognitive connections that sensory inputs get associated with.
<br>
<br>
I obviously agree with you regarding the storage of "symbolized sensory experiences". But I disagree that this means that we have "stored" the sensory experience.
<br>
<br>
Exact storage of sensory data is not possible, due to the huge quantity of information. What is stored are generalized models (inducted prototypes, relations among categories, temporal structure, etc). In other words, we are often able - via imagery - to reconstruct one particular sensory experience in our mind (such as the sight of a beautiful scenery) but what we "see" during this reconstruction is our *interpretation* of that scenery, not the real sensory stream. As time passes, this reconstruction loses detail (because of the power law decay of memory), up to the point where what is left is just vague recollections.

Also, notice that sensory information is not complete at the human-body reception points. And that it must then traverse the body to get to the brain -- during traversal it can be distorted, due to the state of the body (i.e., exhaustion, drugs, temperature). When it finally gets to the brain, it may have been altered in ways that the brain does not decipher it with as much accuracy as prior sensory experience. So, exact storage of the body-sensation is never possible because it never gets to the brain in the exact form that the sesory receptors detected it.

<br>
<br>
Yes, but recent brain stimulation experiments seem to show that when a person's brain is stimulated to want to act (move a hand), the person thinks that he did so for a reason, because the activation reasons are stored at the same neural location. Similary, emotions also become associated at the neural level, with actions, or scenes, situations, etc, as do bodily sensations. For example, you hear a song and remember how it felt on your lips and body when some girl was kissing you in the past.

<br>
<br>
Even if you remember one specific experience from time to time, you won't be able to maintain an accurate record of it. The problem is that there are always small details which aren't strongly associated with the important stuff in a specific scenery. For instance, when you look to a complex natural scenery, you may notice the typical movement of trees, an animal running in the background, etc. But you may not consciously notice some of the details of that scenery (such as the specific color of a specific plant). Although this plant will be registered by your retina and although it will activate some groups of neurons in your brain during the time you observe the scenery, it will not be associated with the rest of the "important stuff". It is just like "noise". Then, as time goes, this neural activation will lose strength (because of the power law decay) and it will not be a part of the remembered scenery, even if this complex imagery is rehearsed frequently. This may seem like a disadvantage, but it is in fact an important characteristic of our cognition: we care to remember only the important stuff, and this helps our brain to cope with a humongous quantity of information.</p></td>

In that case, those details are unnecessary in the succeeding concept formations. However, the relevant part of the sensory input has been stored.

<br>
project and see it as complementary to the goals
<br>
of the World Wide Web consortium, where I am the
<br>
activity lead for voice and multimodal interaction.
<br>
<br>
I think it is important that OpenMind is an open
<br>
source project, given that it's operating basis
<br>
is to gather the help of the Web community to
<br>
collectively build the knowledgebase. That
<br>
knowledge should belong to the community that
<br>
built it!
<br>
<br>
My second point is that common sense knowledge is
<br>
really a set of skills that are developed through
<br>
everyday interactions. It is not enough to just
<br>
provide a training interface, and instead we must
<br>
find a way for the system to evolve through
<br>
actually interacting with millions of people on
<br>
a daily basis, so that the skills are honed
<br>
through regular practical use.
<br>
<br>
This will necessitate us finding a wide and
<br>
growing range of applications of real value to
<br>
end-users. This sounds like something that would
<br>
fit into my vision for distributed multi-user
<br>
multi-modal applications, see:

<br>
<br>
We would get a living breathing learning Web
<br>
based upon a huge collaborative open source
<br>
arena. This would initially be developed by
<br>
students and enthusiasts, but as it proves
<br>
its value, we would see companies joining in,
<br>
because the endeavor is too big for any given
<br>
company to compete on its own.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to collaborating on how we can
<br>
create a common sense initiative for the Web!

The approaches to simulate "common sense" through arithmetic machine programming of a vast array of nearly infinite relationships and rules is likely futile and mathematically nearly impossible. I think Chomsky said it, Winston said it. So, what if there exists, as there does for motion, energy, electricity, thermodynamics, etc.  a simple "golden rule", a formula which could generate what we now know is "innate human logic"?
<br>
For brain/memory system simulation, a biologically inspired cognitive architecture is required. And if it were to exist, it would require at least a few proofs to be accepted: 1) yields innate logic, 2) sustains no nP problem and is therefore arithmetically scalable (as opposed to geometrically), 3) works with the non rules based system of natural language. Further, 4) it would require the ability to learn, to incorporate cog functions of induction and reduction. Going the next step, it would require all cognitive functions to be simulated and to work within the general brain/memory processing system ... in one unified theory of cognition. And like brain processing, might probaby be a parallel dual processing system.
<br>
I believe the logic system exists today and that there may also be a compatible chip based on the same dual parallel processing system. I also believe it will change the way we approach machine intelligence and it may even be a lynch pin core technology to bring us a step closer to level 5 of "singularity" about which speaks the forum meister in his latest book.
