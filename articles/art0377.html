<div class="TeaserText">It's only a movie. Or is it? The three coolest films of this millennium so far tantalizingly blur the boundary between real and virtual worlds and suggest the question: Are you living in a simulation? <b>Spoilage warning:</b> the following reveals plot details.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published January 15, 2002 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>A Beautiful <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> -- a fascinating exploration of the nexus of <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> and madness of eminent mathematician and Nobel prize in <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> winner <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/" target="_new">Dr. John Nash</a> --is my nomination for the best accelerating-<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>-related movie of the millennium (so far). Intellectually engaging plot, humor, great acting. <br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/nash.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Best part: an explanation of the "Nash equilibrium"--a key <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> in modern <a class="thought" href="entries/game_theory_entry.html">game theory</a>--in a bar pickup scene. (It helps if you read the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/n/nasar-mind.html" target="_new">book</a>  first.)</p>
<p>Yes, cracking enemy codes in newspaper and magazine ads and being chased by Russians in a CIA getaway car is fictional. But Nash, who transformed von Neumann's <a class="thought" href="entries/game_theory_entry.html">game theory</a> with his PhD dissertation in 1950, was indeed obsessed with finding obscure patterns--including those from ETs who were, he says, "communicating with him" through the newspaper.</p>
<p>And who's to say definitively they weren't? "The ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way my mathematical ideas did," said Nash. "So I took them seriously."</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">Reality</a> vs. virtuality is also at the core of the mind-bending Vanilla Sky, <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> two on my list. The central character, David Ames, played by Tom Cruise, is disfigured in a car crash, has his face restored by plastic surgery, and finds himself being interrogated by a police psychologist for his alleged involvement in the bizarre murder of his girl friend, who morphs into another woman. <br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/vanillasky.jpg" vspace="10"><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Like Nash, Ames seems to be involved in a bizarre conspiracy. But in a dramatic twist, it turns out he actually died after being in coma following the crash and was put in cryonic storage, having chosen to have a VR <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> while in suspension -- presumably by having his brain downloaded prior to the accident.</p>
<p>The film joins the growing VR genre, including Brainstorm, The Lawnmower Man, Strange Days, The <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>, eXistenZ, The Thirteenth Floor, and Being John Malkevich.</p>
<p>"It's the first film that deals intelligently with the issues raised by <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a>," as <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> pioneer and Alcor co-founder Mike Darwin was quoted on the Extropians list. "It is the first movie that captures the imagery created by <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> (Alcor and Trans <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> style) as filtered through the media. It was very, very strange to see the world I have participated in creating in <a class="thought" href="entries/microcosm_entry.html">microcosm</a> writ large, and now clearly a part of The Culture."</p>
<p>An even stranger movie is my <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 3, Richard Linklater's Waking <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. Using rotoscoping to convert live <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> into impressionistic, quasi-animated, dreamy sequences, this head-trippy film portrays the adventures of a twenty-something guy floating through a series of multilayered, free-associational philosophical and <a class="thought" href="entries/visionary_entry.html">visionary</a> musings about the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/existentialism_entry.html">existentialism</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/lucid_dreaming_entry.html">lucid dreaming</a>, while trying to figure out if he's awake, dreaming, or dead. <br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/wakinglife.jpg" vspace="10"><br>

<br>
</p>
<p>He's given one hint: if you turn on a light <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> and nothing changes, you're dreaming. He wakes up, turns on a light <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>, and nothing changes.</p>
<p>The highlight of the film for me is a hypercaffeinated Kurzweilian character who expounds on the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of life and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> over the past four billion years.</p><h1>Are you living in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation?</h1><p>So what's real and what's Memorex? In his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.simulation-argument.com/" target="_new">essay</a>, "Are You Living In a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Simulation," Dr. <a class="thought" href="entries/bostrom_entry.html">Nick Bostrom</a> claims there's no way to know whether or not you're living in an "ancestor- simulation" (simulation of us by our descendents) created by some <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> to amuse or educate themselves by reconstructing the past. [1]</p>
<p>Of course, we currently don't have the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power or <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to create conscious minds. But as Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> has said in <b>The</b> <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, that might be achievable as early as 2020, when a massively parallel, neural-net <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> will have the calculation <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the human brain, estimated at 2 x 10<sup>16</sup> calculations per second -- or even by 2010, using a <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>. (It might take another ten years to develop the needed <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, he adds.) Based on his "<a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>" (double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>), in just a few centuries, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> would be beyond our <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>.</p>
<p>"Such a mature stage of technological development will make it possible to convert planets and other astronomical resources into enormously powerful computers," says Bostrom.</p>
<p>To be a true simulation, you would need to simulate the real world from the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> down to the quantum level, which would require mind-boggingly massive real-time computations. But, he argues, "to get a realistic simulation of human <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, much less is needed -- only whatever is required to ensure that the simulated humans, interacting in normal human ways with their simulated environment, don't notice any irregularities."</p>
<p>Bostrom says the "main computational cost consists in simulating organic brains down to the neuronal or sub-neuronal level." But that assumes a neuromorphic design (based on the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of the brain) is required. <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a>, who pioneered neuromorphic design, tells me that he now believes non-neuromorphic algorithms are more efficient in simulating brain functions.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would also be more efficient to <b>always</b> generate <b>ad hoc</b> simulations that are based on the current attention state of each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>, rather than continuous simulation of the entire world. We could probably also achieve savings in storage requirements by representing objects in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> with fractals.</p>
<p>For more computational efficiency, you could also omit the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of the inside of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> and use compressed representations for distant astronomical objects, says Bostrom. "The <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> would have enough computing power to keep track of the detailed belief-states in all human brains at all times. Thus, when it saw that a human was about to make an observation of the microscopic world, it could fill in sufficient detail in the simulation in the appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> on an as-needed basis. Should any error occur, the director could easily edit the states of any brains that have become aware of an anomaly before it spoils the simulation. Alternatively, the director can skip back a few seconds and rerun the simulation in a way that avoids the problem."</p>
<p>To do such an ancestor simulation of the entire mental human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> to date would require ~10<sup>37</sup> operations [2], polymath <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> programmer Robert Bradbury calculates. Or if we accept <a class="thought" href="entries/hameroff_entry.html">Stuart Hameroff</a>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0183.html" target="_new">speculation</a> that "brain processes relevant to <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> extend downward within neurons to the level of cytoskeletal microtubules," 10<sup>27</sup> operations per second would be required to simulate a single person's mental <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, or ~10<sup>47</sup> operations for the entire human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>But let's stay with the lower figure for now. Bradbury says it could be achieved with a "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/MatrioshkaBrains.html" target="_new">Matrioshka</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a>" [MB, a megascale <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> constructed as a series of shells around a star using nanoscale components], providing roughly 10<sup>42</sup> operations per second. With some of the more advanced nanoscale computational architectures and cooling methods, you might be able to push this up by perhaps as much as 10<sup>10</sup> operations per second."</p>
<p>Assuming the lower figure, an MB could run the entire ancestor- simulation of human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> in less than 10<sup>-5</sup> second [3]. Or else it could run 100,000 instantiations of virtual mental worlds simultaneously (parallel worlds). Interaction between these parallel realities would allow for some interesting anomalous experiences, including "time travel" (the interaction would add significant computational load and limit the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of instantiations, of course).</p>
<p>But the MB design assumes known <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> design principles, "probably far from optimal," says Bostrom. "If we could create quantum computers, or learn to build computers of nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> or plasma, we could push closer to the theoretical limits. <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">Posthuman</a> civilizations would have enough computing power to run hugely many ancestor-simulations even while using only a tiny fraction of their resources for that purpose," he says.</p>
<p>At the extreme, <a class="thought" href="entries/lloyd_entry.html">Seth Lloyd</a> of MIT has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html?id%253D48" target="_new">calculated</a> the conceivable limits of computing power of a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>: a maximum processing speed of about 10<sup>51</sup> operations/sec (equivalent to 10<sup>33</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> Blue Gene supercomputers) for a 1-kg <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>.</p>
<p>To take it even further out, "It may be possible for simulated civilizations to become <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a>," Bostrom adds. "They may then run their own ancestor-simulations" using powerful virtual machines they build in their simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> (these virtual machines themselves could be stacked in multiple levels.)</p>
<p>What's more, "We would have to suspect that the posthumans running our simulation are themselves simulated beings; and their creators, in turn, may also be simulated beings. <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">Reality</a> may thus contain many levels. Even if it is necessary for the <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> to bottom out at some stage -- the metaphysical status of this claim is somewhat obscure -- there may be room for a large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> could be increasing over time."</p>
<p>Of course, all this assumes the human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> doesn't go extinct first by some massive nuclear or <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> catastrophe or global <a class="thought" href="entries/ecophagy_entry.html">ecophagy</a> (the "gray goo" scenario) in which out-of-control <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> replicators wipe out all life on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>--although <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a> does offer some possible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0142.html%20" target="_new">solutions</a>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that simulating even a single <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> might be too expensive, says Bostrom. " If so, then we should expect our simulation to be terminated when we are about to reach the <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a> stage." Talk about spoil sports!</p><h1>How to live in a simulation</h1><p>Are you still with me? OK, let's assume our <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">posthuman</a> successors have somehow made it to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> and they're running a simulation, starring ... us. What should we do--and would we have any control?</p>
<p>"The only way to influence the real world is to somehow influence whoever is observing this simulation," points out Robin Hanson in his Bostrom-inspired essay, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0375.html" target="_new">How To Live In A Simulation</a>." </p>
<p>Since such simulations would be very costly, they would probably be limited in time and space. To make the simulators less likely to drop you from their simulation or end it, you should be entertaining--"funny, outrageous, violent, sexy, strange, pathetic, heroic ... in a word 'dramatic.' And since the simulators may want to play famous people, you should "keep famous people happy, or at least interested... and try to stay personally interesting to the famous people around you." Sounds like a typical Hollywood cocktail party.</p>
<p>The simulators might also want to play <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, "punishing and rewarding people in the simulation based on how they lived their lives." In that case, "you'll have to figure out the common features of morality in descendants who are willing to play <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>."</p><h1>Getting a clue</h1><p>So unless you <i>are</i> a <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, how would you know you were living in a simulation? Well, there might be glitches or discontinuities. Ames figured out he was in a simulation when he encountered his VR tech support person, who was then able to modify the scenario in real time. In the movie Pleasantville, two contemporary teenagers arrive back in the 50s and influence it to transform into the 60s. In Fred Pohl's "Tunnel Under the World" scifi story, the hero discovers that the world is just empty space when he turns over a boat in his basement and figures out he's in a simulation created on a <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> scale. That could ruin your day.</p>
<p>Bradbury suggested three other examples: Theodore Sturgeon's scifi "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.interlog.com/~mimyandy/time_travel/s_reviews/conklin.html" target="_new">Yesterday Was Monday</a>" (an auto mechanic wakes up and finds tiny blue men preparing the "set" for the next "act" the next day), the movie <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041030132144/http://www.all-reviews.com/videos/dark-city.htm" target="_new">Dark City</a>  (soulless entities known as The Strangers freeze time every night to rearrange the skyline and warp every resident's mind to find out what makes us "tick") and the movie The Truman Show (a man's entire life is scripted as programming for a 24-hour television <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>). Innovator Mike Lorrey also suggested Stephen King's movie "The Langoliers" (ten passengers on a plane awaken to find everyone else in the world has disappeared and figure out how to get back into <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>).</p>
<p>Another clue might be anomalous experiences, which might imply defective algorithms or <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. For example, telepathy might imply "leaks" between data sets and UFOs, alien abductions and "miracles" might imply deliberate attempts to mess with our minds to test theories or for amusement. [4]</p>
<p>Bostrom added these tips: "You'd want to know what kind of simulations the simulators would be most interested in running, and the cost of these different kinds of simulations. Then the simulation <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> would predict that we should find ourselves in a world that ranks high on interest and low on cost. Right now, we don't have much evidence to go on in either these regards. (Remember that what we take as the fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> may be largely merely apparent in a simulation, so we can't necessarily infer the real cost of running an adequate simulation of our experiences from the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of what we take to be physical laws.)</p>
<p>"Then there are obvious tipoffs, e.g., the simulators could tell us that we are in a simulation or even extract us from it into their own level of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, so the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> is clearly not conceptually unverifiable."</p>
<p>Tools for creating such <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> simulations are evolving rapidly. Already, with films like Final Fantasy, the best video games for PlayStation and Xbox, and the most powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> simulators, the boundaries between real and virtual are dissolving as simulation representation approaches the limits of the "real" (whatever that means) world.</p>
<p>In just seven years, in 2009, we'll have "routine, full-immersion, visual-auditory, virtual-<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> shared environments with images written directly to our retinas from our eyeglasses and contact lenses," says Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>. "By 2029, '<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> beamers' will beam their entire flow of sensory experiences and feelings onto the Web the way people now beam their images from their web cams."</p>
<p>At that point, synthesized simulacra and the real world may be indistinguishable, as will perhaps cyborgs and people. Telling the difference will become the challenge of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> -- and the subject of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> films.</p>

So while you have the processing power to run an ancestor simulation in 10<sup>-5</sup> aggregate <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a> seconds, you may not be able to actually run the simulation in 10<sup>-5</sup> "real" seconds because of the time that <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> nodes will have to wait to get <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about something that happened in another part of the simulation.</p>
<p>"Obviously you could optimize things by putting 'minds' that require close connectivity on the same 'node' or adjacent nodes of the net. So how fast in real time you could run an ancestor simulation depends in large part how interconnected individuals within the simulation are. The more interconnected they become, the slower the simulation will run in real time.</p>

I'm still skeptical that we're about to see intelligent SF in Hollywood, as flashy dystopic crud like The Matrix is easier to write and therefore to sell. But I'll dance in the street if I turn out to be wrong and cogent, engrossing cinematic treatments of the sort of stuff that routinely forms part of the mindfiles of the regular visitors to this site appear before they become actuality. As for nanotech bottlenecks, if RK is on the money we'll be into femtotech within a century or so, bringing emulators that much closer.  </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Additional to the above, I find myself wondering about the long-term prospects for life in the cosmos -- simulated or otherwise -- using Jupiter brains, SL's 'ultimate computer' and so forth.
<br>
<br>
If the current cosmological findings are correct, then the universe will keep expanding, so the biosphere will thin out and become cold. I am unsure how then intelligent life can exist beyond a finite time period in that event. 
<br>
<br>
I discussed this briefly with David Deutsch and although he admitted he would be devoting some time in his next book to grappling with the matter he conceded it was an interesting conundrum, given the contradiction it implies to the Turing Principle which can be said to underly both computer science and epistemology. 
<br>
<br>
Unless the data is being misinterpreted -- perhaps as a result of a central misconception, such as the existence of Time (as proposed by Julian Barbour) or the value of the Hubble Constant (as mooted by Frank Tipler) it appears to me that life is still boned, short of some astonishing new data that recinds this thesis. 
<br>
<br>
Of course, if all this is an imaginary and simulated cosmos -- perhaps the work of a lab experiment (ala Alan Guth) or maybe some sort of eschatological artwork -- perhaps being hosted by AARON on the 'real' Kurzweil.AI site (!) then the problem may be less grave than first appears...</p></td>

As far as reality being a program.  Why not? Superstring theory suggests that all subatomic particles are but 1-dimentional vibrating loops of immensely small proportions. Thus we may have a digital universe, i.e. the loops are bits.  The universe could be a self-programming entity, programming in various dimensions without necessarily knowing where it's going.  This self-programming may be the result of a given mandate, or set of mandates.  Such a mandate might be: 1) recursively observe reality for Lorenz-type attractors, 2) observe any anomalies in the attractors multi-dimensionally, 3) seek out experience in the "direction" of the anomaly and then go to 1) above until a new attractor manifests.
<br>
<br>
In other words the universe changes in the direction of change and only for the sake of experiencing change, thus the universe has a mindless component and an intelligent component --God is both a wandering idiot and a design genius.

<br>
<br>
Consider how we have already been lied to by the film "A Beautiful Mind": 
<br>
<br>
The film is supposedly a film-biography of John Nash based on a book of the same name. But Nash's life story and history were substantially altered for the film's story. Specifically, it removes all references to Nash, like Alan Turing (another important code breaker), being gay. Nash was arrested for soliciting gay sex and this caused his losing security clearance for his job at the government think tank. In 1954, with the House of UnAmerican Activities still very strong, there was an extreme fear of having homosexuals in security positions. Nash's case was one of the best known and strongest for the argument against allowing homosexuals into sensitive positions.
<br>
<br>
The book (and there have been several books written about Nash - his homosexuality is mentioned in all of them) deals with this in detail but it's removed from the film.
<br>
<br>
This is a literal re-writing of history... Removing not only gay people from history, but also removing the unfair legal tactics used against them. Instead, the film makes much of an utterly fictional relationship between Nash and his wife, who in reality were never close.
<br>
<br>
I'm not gay myself, but I have friends who are and this kind of stuff disturbs them.

Did anyone notice that in the end the question was answered -- he chooses to wake up in a real world where he will have to deal with uncertainties, grow old, and die. 
<br>
<br>
That reality could be a simulation is refuted by provable incompleteness of formal systems. All simulations are incomplete, but reality exists anyway. That our knowledge of it is alway incomplete and fallible is the simple lesson that modernity is trying to teach us. Fallibility is overcome in one way alone -- paying attention to the data that reality is giving you at all times, and adapt your plans based on the new data you get in the middle of your plans. 
<br>
<br>
Simulations are kind of nice, but nothing beats the exhileration of navigating reality itself given the fallibility of our plans. And nothing gives pleasure like observing nature itself and participating just for the experience itself rather than to analyze it. The Enlightenment philosophers used to call it Cosmotheology -- who needs an anthropomorphic God/programmer when the material universe itself is the body of God.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I misread the movie reviewer's review of Vanilla Sky. He never said Ames died in the car crash after all, but died after he woke up from the coma after the car crash. You also never assumed Ames died in the car crash either, like you mentioned. I stand corrected on this. As to whose eyes he saw at the end? Nobody's as far as I could tell. It looked liked his own eyes that he opened. Also, what he said in the movie at the end. He said he wanted to wake up from his virtual dream and live a real life. This is what he told his tech support person at the end of the movie. This is what he chose to do, after the tech support guy gave him his two choices, whether to remain in suspension and still live with Sofia through his lucid dream, or wake up to the real world. So why would he be looking at Juliana Gianni's eyes,(his blonde stalker bed pal)or Sofia's eyes at the end of the movie after he supposedly woke up? This contradicts what he wanted, i. e. to wake up and live a real life. You got me curious again about this movie. I might rent the video and watch the end very closely. If he did see someone else's eyes at the end, either Juliana's or Sofia's, this means he never woke up, because he couldn't wake up to the real world and see Juliana's eyes or Sofia's eyes since they were both dead. The only reason I can see for him not waking up to the real world, after jumping off the skyscraper, is that there was a unrepairable glitch-error in his lucid dream that prevented him from doing so, and he never woke up, but woke up to the same nightmare he was having, seeing his face become disfigured again, and seeing Sofia changing into Juliana and back into Sofia, lol.</p></td>

<br>
Hello there,
<br>
Right, the glitch in his virtual dream/nightmare created by him, was corrected.
<br>
He did choose the real life.
<br>
Never the less, it didn't happen? Ok, what do you base this assertion on in the movie? It did happen because he dove off the skyscraper at the end, and woke up from from his vitual dream, into real life. That's what it showed at the end, him opening his eyes after jumping off the building and hitting the pavement below.
<br>
During the course of his vitual dream, Julianna was a nightmare for him, because Sofia kept transforming into Julianna. It was unclear what he wanted for awhile, but he choose to wake up from his dream and into real life. He choose to live a real life. Again, what evidence in the movie do you base your assertion on that it was unclear to him, and to us, that he didn't know what he wanted? He simply wanted to wake up and live a real life. What he wanted to do in his real life is unclear after waking up into real life. So if this is what you are referring to, about what he wanted to do with his life after waking up, is moot, since this is where the movie ends. </p></td>

A combination of both?

In those cases - it was the last nightmare - falling from the skyscraper - as a necessary glitch repairing - or whatever.

If we are more pessimistic - it was not the last nightmare. But it would be too cheap.

If he woke in the real world - what was the cause of the nightmares? Remember "again"? Who was already there for David?

I think the reason for his subconcious doing this to him was given as a clue in the movie. The clue to this was where McCabe, the psychologist, theorized to Aames that his feelings of resposibility and guilt towards Julianna Gianni, because of the way he treated her, which was indifferently, turned Julianna into Sofia during his virtual dream state. He cared more about Sofia than Julianna</p></td>

When somebody travels across several time zones they experience "jet lag".  Maybe this is actually "net lag", caused by the delay from interacting with others from a different server.  And then, during a sleep period, their data files are moved to the new server.  When they wake up, the lag effect is gone!
