<p>
<i>What is the presentation about that you made at TED11?</i>
</p>
<p>I transformed myself into <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, my <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego. She is the first live virtual recording and performing artist. She is a demonstration that "you can be who you want to be" in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. We all have personalities within us that are difficult if not impossible to express with our real-world bodies and in real-world environments. Yet in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, we can express ourselves in new ways. We can go where we want to go. We can even "have been" who we want to have been, and be with whom we want to be with. Ultimately, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will be fully competitive with real reality in terms of the level of realism, while offering profound news ways to explore the world and to interact with each another.</p>
<p>I've always found myself attracted to <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> performers, and realized that I not only wanted to be with them, but wanted to be them. This is not a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of gender confusion; having other gender personae in our fantasies is integral to our ability to relate romantically to the opposite <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a>. These personalities are there in all of us, but up to now have existed only in our imagination. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> provides the opportunity to express ourselves in important new ways.</p>
<p>My presentation pushes the state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> in real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> transformation, and is intended as a harbinger of things to come. Although real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> cartoon characters have been created before, this is the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> and real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> image rendering technologies have been combined in a performance setting to create real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> photorealistic virtual performers. It is the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that someone has given a singing performance in front of a live audience while being transformed into someone else. It is also the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that a dancer has danced in a live performance while being transformed into someone else.</p>
<p>Real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> and photorealistic image transformation has obvious application to the entertainment world, but will ultimately profoundly affect the everyday world. By 2009, we will all have ubiquitous, full-immersion, shared, visual-auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments. We will have images written directly to our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s from our eyeglasses and contact lenses, high-resolution <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> of our bodies through automatic detection of our <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> fields, and very-high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connection to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> at all times. Going to a web site will mean entering a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment where you can visit other people. It will be just like being there, at least as far as seeing and hearing is concerned. Of course, keep in mind that the people you meet in these <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments may have very different appearances and personalities in real reality. Ultimately, we will regard these virtual personalities as just as real and important as the one we portray in real reality.</p>
<p>By 2029, we will have <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, blood-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> sized robots, traveling through the capillaries of our brains communicating <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly directly with our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. This type of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, called "<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s," has already been demonstrated. Billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s can be communicating with our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brains and with each other, all on a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>. This will enable shared <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments incorporating all of the senses. With this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we will be able to meet each other and engage in any type of interaction, from business negotiations to sexual and sensual encounters, in any type of environment, from recreations of Earthly places to fantastic imaginary locales.</p>
<p>"Experience Beamers" will beam their entire flow of sensory experience as well as their <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s onto the web just as people beam their images from their web cams today. You'll be able to plug in and experience what it is like to be someone else, &#224; la "Being John Malkovich," as well as relive interesting archived experiences.</p>
<p>Like any other <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> is not emerging fully formed in one instant. Today, it has obvious limitations. I need dozens of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and three-quarters of an 18-wheel truck worth of equipment to transform myself into <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and perform with my virtual dancers in virtual environments. But I can describe today how by the end of this decade, full-immersion, visual-auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will be ubiquitous, woven into our clothing, and highly realistic. Ultimately, <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will offer everything real reality offers and a lot more. By the middle of this century, we will be spending most of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments.</p>
<p>The word "virtual" may be unfortunate because it implies that the experiences and environments aren't "real." But we've already had one form of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> for over a century. The telephone is auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, and that's exactly how nineteenth century enthusiasts viewed it. It would not be correct to say that interactions we have with each other on the telephone aren't "real." Rather, interacting with other real people over the phone represents an important extension of our ability to relate to each other. When we can add all of the other senses to these interactions, it will be another profound way to have real experiences with other real people.</p>
<p>When I transform myself into <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, I do feel empowered to express myself as a new personality. I feel that I am doing more than just playing a role, I am expressing my <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego, and I do find it liberating. I had a vision of who she was, and what she looked like, and with the help of dozens of brilliant people, I feel she expresses my original conception.</p>
<p>
<i>Why did you choose to launch <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> at TED11? </i>
</p>
<p>Where else would I launch her? <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> involves intense exploration and development of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, entertainment, and design, and that's what TED is all about.</p>
<p>
<i>Do you think the general public is ready for this type of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>?</i>
</p>
<p>Absolutely. Like all other <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies from the printed book to the Web, entertainment applications are dominant early on, then <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> to profound new ways to interact, to learn, and to create new <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>
<i>How will <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, or this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, change our lives? Why is it so revolutionary? </i>
</p>
<p>The ultimate significance is as a step in the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion of our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> from real reality to <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. Thousands of years ago, written scrolls enabled ideas to travel from one place to another. A century ago, the telephone provided auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. Today, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> behind <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> represents an early manifestation of full immersion visual-auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. Within a few decades, we will be able to do anything with anyone in virtual environments that rival and even exceed the realism of real reality. It will enable us to have profound new experiences, and to express ourselves in new ways.</p>
<p>
<i>Will it change the way people conduct business? </i>
</p>
<p>The concept of the "business meeting" is the most obvious example. We'll be able to meet in groups ranging from two people to large groups, regardless of the physical proximity of our physical bodies. We'll be able to select our environments of choice, choosing from a well-appointed office, a virtual Mediterranean beach, a virtual wild game preserve, and virtual flights past celestial objects. More importantly, we can select the personae that best suit our intentions and goals for each encounter. If we go out thirty years, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will not only enable us to engage in full-immersion virtual-reality experiences involving all the senses, but they will literally expand our minds. They can provide trillions of additional interneuronal connections, thereby expanding our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, and cognitive faculties. We will ultimately combine the subtlety of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> with the speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> sharing ability that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s already excel in.</p>
<p>
<i>What is unique about your vision/business plan? Where are you taking this? </i>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is more than a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> demo. We are launching a serious career for <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> as the first live virtual musical performing and recording artist. We realize that she will have interest because of the novelty of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but we intend <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to be more than a novelty act. Our creative team in terms of musical, theatrical, and dance talent matches that of our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> team, and we plan on making a serious artistic statement. We plan a <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> album, live performances on television and other venues.</p>
<p>We also plan on positioning KurzweilAI.net as the "place to be" on the Web for finding out about the advanced technologies of the twenty-first century, and their far reaching implications for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. We have an impressive line-up of the world's "big thinkers" committed to providing significant <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> for the site. The <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed with a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of integrated web technologies that allow the user to converse with the <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a> version of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, and to explore the intuitive organized concepts in the display of her "<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>."</p>
<p>
<i>Are you planning to make money with <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>? If so, how do you intend to do so? </i>
</p>
<p>There are three business models behind <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>. First, she can make money the old fashioned way, as a performing and recording artist, the same way that other musical artists make money. The fact that she is the first live virtual musical performing and recording artist certainly helps her appeal, but we intend on going beyond her interest as a novelty or as a mere <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> demonstration.</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to create <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, we have organized considerable technological talent and expertise in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and we plan on harnessing this capability to assist other firms in creating <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> and entertainment <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>The same model exists for KurzweilAI.net. This site is a showcase for both <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and web enabling technologies, and we plan to assist other firms to present their own <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> using our own proprietary <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and expertise. It's the same model we have successfully followed at Medical <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> Company (<a class="thought" href="entries/familypractice_entry.html">FamilyPractice.com</a>), which is another <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_technologies_entry.html">Kurzweil Technologies</a> company.</p>
<p>
<i>How will this impact <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, entertainment, and the merging of the two? </i>
</p>
<p>The first major project I undertook that impacted the merger of entertainment and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_music_systems_entry.html">Kurzweil Music Systems</a>. The type of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> we pioneered is now the basis for most commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, such as movie and television soundtracks and recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. With <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, we are integrating both musical and visual technologies, which is obviously the basis of most forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>
<i>How is <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> different from other <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> "personalities"? </i>
</p>
<p>In terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is the first live virtual musical performing and recording artist. My presentation at TED represents the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that a singer has performed in front of a live audience while transforming themselves into someone else. The same is true in terms of a dance performance. People have previously combined <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> with real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> image rendering for cartoon like characters, but <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is the first virtual performer that is lifelike and photorealistic.</p>
<p>The web-based <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a> version of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is the first lifelike photorealistic <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a> on the web that you can converse with using a conversational <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>. She represents a unique combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, combining a lifelike <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>, a conversational <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>, synthetic speech, and the "<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a>" display of her <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s.</p>
<p>
<i>How will <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> go on to be a virtual recording artist? </i>
</p>
<p>By recording an album and performing her original songs on television and other venues. At TED11, she performed an original song Come Out and Play  (lyrics by <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> by Zoux), and an original version of Grace Slick's White Rabbit.</p>
<p>White Rabbit is one of my favorite songs. It describes the <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">Alice</a> encounters ("the white knight is talking backward") and ends with the door <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>'s advice to "feed your head." So <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> leads to new insight and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. It's a good <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of the creative process, and an empowering personal <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>. Incidentally, it's also a good description of how an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary (or "genetic") <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> works, which is a method I frequently employ in my <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> projects.</p>
<p>
<i>What do her voice, appearance, movements derive from? </i>
</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> manifestation of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, special magnetic sensors pick up the motion of my body. Special <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s interpret these signals to build a moving three-dimensional image of my body. These are transformed into the movements of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s body by the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> taking into consideration the fact that her body is shaped somewhat differently from mine. Other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s then create the real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> moving images that correspond to <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s body moving in a similar manner to mine. <a class="thought" href="entries/phoneme_entry.html">Phoneme</a> recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, which is based on similar principles to speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, detects the <a class="thought" href="entries/phoneme_entry.html">phoneme</a>s in my speech. This is in turn affects the shape of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s mouth and other facial features to reflect her speaking. The actual sound of my voice is transformed into <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s voice through real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> signal processing using principles similar to <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>. Other <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> controls <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s.</p>
<p>Real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> video compositing allows the moving images of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> to be composited with the other virtual performers, specifically <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s back up dancers. These are composited together with images of her virtual environments, which can be static or moving. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> can be made to appear to be actually on the <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of a television <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. For example, she could sit on the coach with Jay Leno and she would appear to be there like any other guest. On television, she can perform on the stage along with other real performers.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> model for <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> was created by scanning a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> model in a special three dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/body_scan_entry.html">body scan</a>ner and head scanner employing lasers and three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> image capture. These images were then manipulated in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> artists to create <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s unique appearance.</p>
<p>
<i>How long did it take to develop the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> behind <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>?</i>
</p>
<p>Many of the subsystems have been in development for years and derive from work in speech recognition (for the <a class="thought" href="entries/phoneme_entry.html">phoneme</a> recognition), <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>  (for the gender bending of my voice to <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s voice), and real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> image rendering (to create <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s moving image). I had the idea to create <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> as a result of my visit to SIGGRAPH, the nation's leading graphics show, in July of 2000, where I gave the keynote address. The integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to create <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> and the creation of her actual image, voice, and personality then took about seven months, at which <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we launched <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> at TED11.</p>
<p>There are about 20 people involved on our own staff plus our "<a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Consortium," which consists of over a dozen leading companies in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> and web enabling technologies. All together, there were over 50 people making significant <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and creative contributions to the creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>.</p>
<p>
<i>Where will we see <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> again? </i>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> will appear as part of my presentation at the ACM1 conference in San Jose on March 12 and at the New York <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> &amp; <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> Expo on April 21. We've had many other requests for her to appear, and now that she's launched her career, she'll be picking her venues carefully.</p>
<p>
<i>Do you expect her to evolve? </i>
</p>
<p>Sure. She's considering getting a tattoo on her belly, but she's getting conflicting advice on this. And then, of course, she's interested in expanding her wardrobe. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> is still a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> expensive, so each of her outfits costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> has her own <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> story, and as she points out, even though she was created more than 24 years after her birth, her story is still just as real as the histories of people in real reality. She just celebrated her 25th. Birthday (on 2/12/01) and her story will continue to evolve. There will be ongoing improvements in the realism of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> behind <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>. We are interested in providing live audiences with a three-dimensional experience in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, preferably without having to use polarized glasses, and we are exploring several possible approaches to doing this.</p>
<p>
<i>Will there be other <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> personalities to follow? </i>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> has a fondness for TED impresario <a class="thought" href="entries/wurman_entry.html">Richard Saul Wurman</a>, and is delighted that he has joined her as one of her virtual backup dancers. We envision continuing to develop her co-performers.</p>
<p>
<i>How does this relate to your web site KurzweilAI.net? </i>
</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a> version of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is your hostess on KurzweilAI.net and is your primary user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. She answers your questions, displays her intuitive "<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a>" idea map, and provides a rich array of articles, links, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> related to your questions.</p>
<p>Although <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> experiences were different from my own story, she shares my passion for both <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and artistic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, particularly for <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. She is very much my <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego in both her virtual-reality performing manifestation and as a web based <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>.</p>
<p>
<i>How does <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a> differ from the "virtual celebrity" who performed at TED11 with you? </i>
</p>
<p>As virtual performer, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is a real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> transformation of myself. She is a demonstration of the ability to "be who you want to be" in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. As <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is her own standalone virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> guiding you through the big thinkers on KurzweilAI.net. Although she's not yet ready to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, she is an effective guide to the concepts that are shaping the remarkable century ahead.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The article Ramona: Questions and Answers by Raymond Kurzweil (Feb 22, 2001) is very interesting and thought provoking.  Considering all of the many applications for virtual beings and 'alter egos,' I wonder when it will be technologically possible for people to put on special eyewear and headphones, and attend, or star in, a virtual sporting event, rock concert, or movie (no reason to drive to the theater, because everyone else - perhaps thousands of people will be online with you, where everyone will see, hear and feel, the ambience of the theater.  I don't know how one would smell and taste the virtual popcorn, but I am certain there will be a way).  The alter-ego-smorgasbord occurs when the participant(s) (the real-life, air-breathing humans) participate in real time, or watch themselves (their voice and likeness ' or perhaps a younger, trimmer version of their likeness and if singing, an enhanced, in-key, version of their voice), together with their friends or favorite celebrities (or whomever), as they star as the leading man or lady in movies (or other productions) where they are featured.  This could occur two (or more ways):  (1) Where one decides, real time, the outcome of the event; where one plays in the form of a game (like a computer or video game -- for lack of a brief explanation); or (2) where a person scans their voice and likeness into their computer and then that person watches him or herself as the star of a movie that they have never seen before.  Then when that person is ultimately asked 'Who is your favorite actor, singer, dancer or sports figure'? One might reply, 'VIRTUALLY always, me.'

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Q&amp;A about Ramona, ok, the article helped fill in 
<br>
a few holes, but I find it curious that Ray and crew 
<br>
chose to delve into making the representation more
<br>
complex.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I find some of Ramona's characteristics very 
<br>
unappealing.  I cannot know if that means I would find 
<br>
the find these characteristics in Ray.     
<br>
<br>
Specifically, I am refering to an occasional
<br>
movement that looks like Ramona is about to barf 
<br>
on me, the side to side body movement,
<br>
the fact that she rarely smiles, and 
<br>
that Ramona appears to lack any interest 
<br>
in who I am or my interests.  
<br>
<br>
On the technical side, I tried to find the control that 
<br>
would allow Ramona to speak a bit faster, but could not.
<br>
<br>
I have a lot more to say but time has run out for now.
<br>
<br>
Later,  Alan
