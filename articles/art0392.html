<p>Originally published January 2002 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011073908/http://www.edge.org/q2002/q_smolin.html" target="_new">Edge</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net January 21, 2002. Read Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s Edge question <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011073908/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0376.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is, I believe, the key question on which the quantum theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> and our understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>, depends. We have made tremendous <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the last years toward each goal, and we come to the point where we need a new answer to this question to proceed further. The basic <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this problem is that most notions of time, change and <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> which <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> more generally, have used are background dependent. This means that they define time and change in terms of fixed points of reference which are outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> under study and do not themselves change or evolve. These external points of reference include usually the observer and clocks used to measure time. They constitute a fixed background against which time and change are defined. Other aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> usually assumed to be part of the background are the properties of space, such as its dimensionality and <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>.</p>
<p>General <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> taught us that time and space are parts of the dynamical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of the world, that do themselves change and evolve in time. Furthermore, in <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> we are interested in the study of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that by definition contains everything that exists, including all possible observers. However, in quantum theory, observers seem to play a special role, which only makes sense if they are outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Thus, to discover the right quantum theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> we must find a new way to formulate quantum theory, as well as the notions of time and change, to apply to a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with no fixed background, which contains all its possible observers. Such a theory is called background independent.</p>
<p>The transition from background dependent theories to background independent ones is a basic theme of contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. Related to it is the change from describing things in terms of absolute properties intrinsic to a given elementary <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>, to describing things in terms of relational properties, which define and describe any part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> only through its relationships to the rest.</p>
<p>In loop quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> we have succeeded in constructing a background independent quantum theory of space and time. But we have not yet understood completely how to put the observer inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">String theory</a>, while it solves some problems, has not helped here, as it is so far a purely background dependent theory. Indeed <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a> is unable to describe closed universes with a positive <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmological_constant_entry.html">cosmological constant</a>, such as observations now favor.</p>
<p>Among the ideas which are now in play which address this issue are <a class="thought" href="entries/barbour_entry.html">Julian Barbour</a>'s proposal that time does not exist, Fotini Markopoulou's proposal to replace the single quantum theory relevant for observing a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> from the outside with a whole family of quantum theories, each a description of what an observer might see from a particular event in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and 't Hooft's and Susskind's holographic principle. This last idea says that <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> cannot describe precisely what is happening inside a region of space, instead we can only talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> passing through the boundary of the region. I believe these are relevant, but none go far enough and that we need a radical reformulation of our ideas of time and change.</p>
<p>As the philosopher Peirce said over a century ago, it is fundamentally irrational to believe in laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that are absolute and unchanging, and have themselves no origin or explanation. This is an even more pressing issue now, because we have strong evidence that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, or at least the part in which we live, came into <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> just a few billion years ago. Were the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> waiting around eternally for a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> to be created to which they could apply? To resolve this problem we need an evolutionary notion of law itself, where the laws themselves evolve as the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> does. This was the motivation for the cosmological natural selection idea that Martin Rees is so kind to mention. That is, as Peirce understood, the notions of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a> must apply not just to living things in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and the laws themselves.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Actually ,  we  humans  and  our  mathematical  calculations  sometimes just are  similar to  religion..  they  find  some  kinda  interesting  notion and  begin to hinge  and  build  all  the  subsequential researches  and  observations  on that idea,paradigm,relative point  of observation or  paradigm or  view that is  not  truly OBJECTIVE but SUBJECTIVE in some sense. because  somebody  bore  that idea and  did something to prove  it and others  trusted it  since  all  kinda  observations  are  not  enough to prove  this  kinda enermous thing.. they can and  may forward  and  inge  their  observations  and mathematical  calculations..  because  as  you  know  mathematics  is  sometimes paradoxical.. that 0  after heavy calculations comes  to equal with 1 and  that means that numbers  can't  always  tell  us  the  truth ..  they  just swirl  around  the IDEA , PHILOSOPHICAL SPECULATION that  sometime somebody  suggested  and made  it  like that  ,that everybody  trusted..
<br>
Science  is  falsifiable unlike  religion so it  means that scientific paradigms  and notions , laws  could  change  and  deviate when they  are replaced  by  the  modern and  new  ideas..actually everybody now accepts  that the  universe  is  really  a  huge  place  where  EVERYTHING IS NEARLY  POSSIBLE amd  there  could  be no  law that  it  could  ever  obey..  it  behaves  itself  the  way that  we  never  could  imagine.. it  could  change  it's size  , form, shape, colour, state, it  could evolve, it  could appear stuffs  from nothingness  and reversely  dissappear  things  back to  nothingness..  and  not  even mathematical , physical , chemical  calculations  or  formulas could  ever  explain why  it  happens--
<br>
So there's  nothing , no  kinda  restriction, no  law, no notion that we could imagine  the  universe as.. it  is  beyond  our  conception and  there's something  true  was said that we  humans, the  conscious observers could never observe  and  begin to learn about  the  true  nature  of  the  universe  until  we get  out  of  the  system and  look  it  from the  outside..  since  we  can't  do  this now  maybe  never.. we  totally  can't  have  any  imagionation or  the  slightest objective idea of  how  this  thing  looks  like..  so  we just  speculate..speculate  and  speculate..
<br>
and  the  paradigm about  the  universe bing bang..  big  crunch..  big  freeze and  big cool.. bog  fart..  anyway  are  truly insane ideas.. false  ideas that  are  just nothing  but  speculations.. and  microwaves making  the zjjjj  sound could be  the sounds that stars could  makie  or  any  kinda Dark matter..  Dark  energy which  constitute the 96% of  the  known universe and these things  remain  totally unknown to us.. and  I  wonder why we  humans like to  speculate  and  call  the  big  bang science..
<br>
anything  could be..  could  have  happened and mere observations  couldn't  be  the  evidence.. we even do  not  understand why we yawn..and  we  try to solve  the  most  distant things..  the  reason is  our  minds..  they  are  evolutionally  maximalist..wanna  hit  the  roof every time..
<br>
just  imagine now.. did  you  ever  think that there  could  be trillionth  of  civilizations  down in the  subatomic  levels? that we  never  could see  and  observe?
<br>
interesting  isn't  it?</p></td>

Maybe that's the big flawed assumption that leads to our confusion.  For humans to grasp a reality, there must be a "something" primarily to grasp onto.  
<br>
<br>
Suppose we work with the premise:  There is ONLY substance, of which space and time are qualities realized in a certain ensemblic assemblage of it.

If time or space had substance, it would get in the way of matter and energy.  It would interfere. But it doesn't, therefore there isn't any substance to time or space.

***Time exists, it just doesn't have any substance and can't cause anything. It is the duration between events.***
<br>
<br>
Time has not substance, however time can cause many things. For example time marks the entropy of all events occurring in the physical body = all atoms are spatially separated by micro times. All the physical atomic interactions between molecules are affected and influenced by every local position of every atom. The intrinsic atomic interconnection provokes the wear and decline of the system, unless any modification is intentionally applied into the system to induce either the acceleration or the deceleration of this process (shorten or extent the life of a system). between these 2 options (shorten or extent) the latest one is quite more difficult to achieve'

'Atoms cause things, not the mark of the atoms'
<br>
<br>
<br>
It would be fair then to define **time**.
<br>
<br>
Why atomic structure of this universe is running clockwise? There must be some force out of atoms that is causing a certain **orientation spin** of the things that mark a direction. All that exists is causing something.
<br>
<br>
The shadow of a tree is not a material thing, however it is causing something. Something that marks or reveals the signs of a cosmic orientation, whenever you are able to calculate and observe how this **shadow** is transforming its shape as long as the earth rotates at a harmonical rate on its axis, turning in an eastward direction, then the sun is apparently rising in the east and apparently travels towards the west, although the sun actually is not moving. The unsubstantial shadows are clues'

= all atoms are spatially separated by micro times. All the physical atomic interactions between molecules are affected and influenced by every local position of every atom.The intrinsic atomic interconnection provokes the wear and decline of the system, unless any modification is intentionally applied into the system to induce either the acceleration or the deceleration of this process (shorten or extent the life of a system). between these 2 options (shorten or extent) the latest one is quite more difficult to achieve'
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is no 'wear' as we tend to think of it (mutual rubbing of parts in contact) because there is a physical space with a perfect vacuum between separate atoms or molecules. The decay of atoms (as in the radioactive nuclides emitting alphas, betas, protons and neutrons) is caused by so-far-unknown internal processes. We know they occur to achieve nuclear stability and have charted their half-lives, but we do not know the precise mechanism. Other changes in atoms can be caused by the addition or removal of betas (electrons), or by the bombardment of neutrons (fission), protons, alphas or even other nuclides (fusion). The extra-nuclear electrons can be shared, as well, forming all the molecules from atoms, usually initiated by chemical reaction such as oxidation (combustion) reduction (electrolysis) or by ionizing radiation (such as cosmic rays). 
<br>
<br>
In every case, there is a process, an interaction of matter or energy from some internal or external source. It is these processes that take various *times* (they each do not occur instantaneously or all at once) and so provide 'clocks' for us. 
<br>
<br>
It is not time that causes events, but rather causative processes and visible or detectable events that mark duration and which we perceive as time. Time is simply the duration between events. 
<br>
<br>
The occurrence, duration, and sequence of events are determined solely by the interactions of objects (matter and energy) that generate them.

<br>
Firstly,there is no way we can pass through the universe without puting space into consideration.
<br>
Normally,space is a code that is neglegible to a change while In space is the relatioship of all space entities with itself as a constant.
<br>
Howewver time is the interval between two spaces after a change.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Again, I am suggesting that the "right language" involves giving primacy to substance.
<br>
<br>
A totally different manner of thinking is required to say (what I propose): "Space and time are qulities of experience BY substance-thinking."
<br>
<br>
The confusion stems from not having a primacy to anything; therefore, everything gets juggled on there being no one agreed-upon primal basis to describe human experience.
<br>
<br>
EXAMPLES OF CONFUSION:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Time exists, it doesn't have any substance and can't cause anything.  It is the duration between events. </p></center> --- Charlie M.
<br>
<br>
If something EXISTS, then what does this mean if not that something has substance?  So,... how can time both exist yet not have any substance or cause?  How can it measure duration, without there being a necessary SUBSTANCE on which to base the interval of duration?  Time, thus, is both substance and cause, from this perspective, because it cannot be invoked as a concept without a concept of substance upon which to ground it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Example:  absolute time zero ("before" big bang) </p></center> --- mystic7
<br>
<br>
Here the word BEFORE invokes time consciousness to describe its abscence.  That's an internal contradiction, because you have to aknlowledge time, in order to say "before", in order to claim its abscence.  CONFUSION.  ABSURDITY.  
<br>
<br>
I agree with maryfran here.

A person's mental image picture has no outward substance, but it exists. A concept such as 'love' has no substance, yet it exists, even though it means something different to each entity. The MIP or concept can't cause anything, it is only someone's interpretation of those intangibles that may, or may not, induce him/her to action.

How can it measure duration, without there being a necessary SUBSTANCE on which to base the interval of duration? Time, thus, is both substance and cause, from this perspective, because it cannot be invoked as a concept without a concept of substance upon which to ground it. 
<br>
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
Time does not 'measure' anything. We measure the duration between events by counting other events that occur naturally, or at our hands. We can measure temporal intervals in days (number of suns, or times the earth has rotated). We can measure how long a standard clock's second is in terms of the number of state-transitions of an atomic clock. (Wicipedia: Since 1967, the International System of Units (SI) has defined the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two energy levels of the ground state of the Caesium-133 atom.) This measurement is not able to be sensed or performed directly by humans, but we build instruments that can do that for us.
<br>
<br>
It all boils down to events caused by the interactions of matter and energy, and the temporal intervals, or duration, between them.

Example: absolute time zero ("before" big bang) 
<br>
--- mystic7 
<br>
<br>
Here the word BEFORE invokes time consciousness to describe its abscence. That's an internal contradiction, because you have to aknlowledge time, in order to say "before", in order to claim its abscence. CONFUSION. ABSURDITY. 
<br>

Anyone may put words (or concepts) together in a nonsensical way, and any others may object to the practice. But both sense and nonsense, like beauty, depend upon the eye of the beholder. 
<br>
<br>
'Before big bang' is a concept that has meaning for me. Even if there wasn't time before the big bang, it means (to me) 'at a point prior to the beginning of this universe.' If you subscribe to the concept that the universe was created in the big bang, there must have been a point prior at which there was nothing'or at the least, less. 
<br>
<br>
I lead a much richer life because I can entertain concepts such as these.

Try it. You might like it.

QUESTION: If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into?
<br>
<br>
ANSWER: NOTHING
<br>
<br>
note: In the above question the term "into" implies volumn rather than space. 
<br>
If you assume the big bang happened 13 billion years ago, and the resulting energy field has been expanding out in all directions at the speed of light, you would have a sphere with a radius of 13B. Now what exist in the exterior of that sphere? Wait a minute-- there is no exterior is there.

I think the reason this may be a hard concept for many of the readers to get can be found in Indo/European languages. The core of those languages is something called a "sentence". The fundamental property of a sentence is a subject/object relationship. Or in other words, Noun/verb. Nouns are held as "persons, places, or things". The term "space" is a noun. </p></td>

Right. Space can't be measured or discerned without objects at the end-points. You can even say it doesn't exist except between bits of matter or energy. The bounded (but open to expansion) universe keeps all its emisions better than a black hole. It is the perfect black hole. If one could perceive from outside the universe (without a physical presence, of course) one would not be able to see it.

***Yes, and for the sake of debate, let's say there are two different types of "space". Space inside the big band energy field , and space outside of the big bang energy field. The inside space is filled with matter and energy. The outside space is nothing.***
<br>
<br>
The outside space is nothing? The concepts of outside and inside are referred to locations or positions of objects. These concepts are coordinates and/or measurements. Which is nothing? Nothing even is not referred to outside or inside.
<br>
<br>
Yes, there could be 2 types of space: our subjective perception of space and time (mere illusions of the human mind, which are real for us indeed) and the quantum space, or a quantum field that lends the possibility to create this qualitative illusion. The quantum field is another higher dimension of comprehension which exactly is not **outside** rather it is just **another phase**'

***Space is the distance between objects.***

This is a very general description that does not help to decipher which factors are behind the measurement. 
<br>
<br>
And every object enjoys itself a planck-time'
<br>
<br>
<br>
Which SIZE of the objects does mean?? Which is the real size of the things?  We can measure an object with a conventional metric ruler, putting directly the ruler over the PHYSICAL EDGES of the object and get the length between objects. But this measurement is not real, because we are confining the atomical structure of the object into an AMORPHOUS LINEAR RULER. In other words we are confining something that exist in 3d (4d?) dimension into the 2d plane of the amorphous ruler. However our minds are perfectly measuring all variables and algorithmic functions that are accounting for sizes correlated with its distances and times'.. just we do not know yet how to describe and represent the complex network of equations that are intervening in all the measuring-process under mental calculation(3d or 4d?). but i think this soon will be made ....

It is prior, and primary, to measurement. It is the first principle upon which any distance measurement can be attempted, and yes, it is perhaps the simplest explanation of what space really is. It is true at any scale. It is elemental, fundamental, and basic. No frills, and not much else to explain, either. No translations into other dimensions or languages, no alternate interpretations necessary, no viewpoints from far-off places, just the guts of what space actually is: the distance between objects. 
<br>
<br>
If we want complications and equations, then mass, distance and time are changed (in a relative way: with respect to a stationary observer) with increasing velocity, as formulated by Einstein. Even with such apparent changes, space still turns out to be the distance between objects.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>***Time does not 'mark' anything, as it has no substance. It is the events caused by the interactions of matter and energy that provide the 'clocks' and so mark the time.***
<br>
<br>
But we make predictions, we create algorithms to calculate for example astronomical events: 'astronomer Halley was quite curious about the orbits of the planets. Using Newton's Principia, Halley calculated orbits for the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 and discovered that they must be successive returns of the same object. He correctly predicted that the comet would return in 1758 and it has been known as Halley's Comet ever since.'
<br>
<br>
This means that before matter and energy interact each other, there is an independent 'algorithmic time' that enables such **interaction**. Then  we can use this independent-algorithmic-time in order to anticipate and predict cosmological events or any other kind of predictions. we even can change the **relative present** to avoid a predicted catastrophe that will occur in x-time.
<br>
<br>
***There is no 'wear' as we tend to think of it (mutual rubbing of parts in contact) because there is a physical space with a perfect vacuum between separate atoms or molecules. The decay of atoms (as in the radioactive nuclides emitting alphas, betas, protons and neutrons) is caused by so-far-unknown internal processes. We know they occur to achieve nuclear stability and have charted their half-lives, but we do not know the precise mechanism. Other changes in atoms can be caused by the addition or removal of betas (electrons), or by the bombardment of neutrons (fission), protons, alphas or even other nuclides (fusion). The extra-nuclear electrons can be shared, as well, forming all the molecules from atoms, usually initiated by chemical reaction such as oxidation (combustion) reduction (electrolysis) or by ionizing radiation (such as cosmic rays).***
<br>
<br>
<br>
This **wear** is not related exactly to physical parts in contact, but to the general entropy of the system (individual parts fully interconnected) that causes the final collapse of such system. Furtheremore, a **wear** does not necessary occur when physical parts are in contact, also it happens with another kind of interactions based in non-physicality (mental, cognitive, ' etc): example a hard discussion being held via internet'.
<br>
<br>
When you say **there is a physical space with a perfect vacuum between separate atoms or molecules** it could be that such separation indeed exists thanks to the time-algorithm.
<br>
<br>
<br>
***In every case, there is a process, an interaction of matter or energy from some internal or external source. It is these processes that take various *times* (they each do not occur instantaneously or all at once) and so provide 'clocks' for us.*** 
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think that you are detecting here some kind of **independent-algorithmic-time** that induces every atom to enjoy its own timing. All these micro-molecules-times functioning within a system are properly synchronized by our conscious mind that is able to experience these 'clocks' as a continuum movie. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
***It is not time that causes events, but rather causative processes and visible or detectable events that mark duration and which we perceive as time. Time is simply the duration between events.***
<br>
<br>
I do not know the original root-causes of the events, so causative processes could involve many 'factors', one of these factors could be 'algorithmic-time'' CREATED/IMPOSED BEFORE BIG-BANG, THIS MEANS THAT @@TIME@@ IS EMBRACING ALL EXISTENCE...
<br>
<br>
The duration between events could mean many things, for example the gestation process of a human duration = 9 months. Result = one person.
<br>
<br>
<br>
***The occurrence, duration, and sequence of events are determined solely by the interactions of objects (matter and energy) that generate them.***
<br>
<br>
In the mind all memories are stored in sequence of events, however the conscious mind uses a **timing** which is not precisely based on physical interaction of objects'

<br>
Which proves my point: We can't predict the recurrence of something that has not already occurred one or more times (and which we have noted the characteristics of the attendant events). Halley had three recorded sightings and using a little celestial mechanics, deduced they were the same object returning each time. The period was between 75 and 76 years, so the prediction wasn't too difficult once the concept of a periodic retracement of the path was understood. 
<br>
<br>
There is no universal algorithmic time. Events occur or not independently according to the interactions of the matter and energy that created those events. A repetition of events (Halley's Comet) is just another case in which, as I've said, "The occurrence, duration, and sequence of events are determined solely by the interactions of objects (matter and energy) that generate them." 
<br>
<br>
The comet knows nothing of time. It does what it does because perhaps some collision set it in motion. Time does not create the events. Events and their durational separation create the sightings, the clock-ticks, that we understand as time. If people had not been on earth to record the sightings, there would have been no change in the orbit. The prediction, however, couldn't have been made without the prior sightings.

I will like us to focus basic AI needs.Normally there are basic human needs.If you can't take care of yourself that is an human failure itself.
<br>
Society is dynamic and the law is trying to catch up with the society.Thesame thing is apply to AI and our society if we can try to create a law that could be a recepient of the society.
<br>
Is a matter of education and information.Above all reformation of our MINDS.
<br>
<br>
Ai basic needs start from AI basic logic.
<br>
Ai basic logic is a CHANGE.
<br>
A change is an imaginary relationship between spaces at a constant space reality.
<br>
<br>
Having known that imagination is VIRTUAL but knowledge is an imagination that is REAL,process with a speed of light {or faster than that} to exist in space at a point in moment waiting for another imagination to take place.
<br>
<br>
If this process occur once in 1CIRCLE then there is a PERIOD.
<br>
If the duration is more than once in many circles so to speak, then there is no period during the process until it stops.
<br>
Hence,NO TIME EXIST in the process but the interval in respect to a circle between the BEGINING of the process could be measure base by our logical minds as TIME.So that we can have TIME at a certain period.
