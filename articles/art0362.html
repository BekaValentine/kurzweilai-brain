<br>
<br>
<p>Speech delivered on November 29, 2001. Published on KurzweilAI.net December 3, 2001. See related <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614010252/http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html?id%253D677" target="_self">news item</a> on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for this wonderful honor.</p>
<p>In my mind,</p>
<p>the Jewish National Fund is a very special organization.</p>
<p>As far as I know,</p>
<p>they've planted more trees</p>
<p>than any other organization in the world.</p>
<p>And in the desert no less.</p>
<p>So that's one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> I'm delighted to be here this evening.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to get a gardening award.</p>
<p>I can't say that I've ever planted a tree,</p>
<p>but I did plant several dozen flowers this past Summer.</p>
<p>So I can honestly say</p>
<p>that I owe this award to my wife, Sonya,</p>
<p>who's been my mentor in my reluctant gardening career.</p>
<p>But seriously,</p>
<p>planting all those trees in the desert</p>
<p>has always been a <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> for me</p>
<p>that anything is possible</p>
<p>when we put our minds to a task,</p>
<p>even peace and understanding.</p>
<p>And I do owe a great deal to my wife Sonya</p>
<p>for being a mentor</p>
<p>on what's valuable in life.</p>
<p>You know, it's the old story</p>
<p>of a guy who's wandering around trying to plant ideas,</p>
<p>and selling them to investors</p>
<p>and so forth,</p>
<p>and his wife keeps him connected</p>
<p>to the really important things,</p>
<p>like children and, well,</p>
<p>gardening.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>Sonya's been planting some important ideas of her own</p>
<p>in the area of child development.</p>
<p>Sonya, why don't you stand up.</p>
<p>And speaking of children,</p>
<p>Amy, why don't you also stand up.</p>
<p>She's not really a child anymore,</p>
<p>but she's been teaching me some important lessons as well,</p>
<p>like for example,</p>
<p>how does a virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> rock star talk and move.</p>
<p>And while I'm recognizing people,</p>
<p>I'd like to thank my partner Aaron,</p>
<p>whom I met 36 years and nine companies ago.</p>
<p>It seems just yesterday that I borrowed your suit, Aaron</p>
<p>because mine had ripped on the train,</p>
<p>to make that pitch to Johnson &amp; Johnson</p>
<p>to fund our first company.</p>
<p>So I'd like to thank you for lending me the suit,</p>
<p>(did I ever thank you for it?)</p>
<p>even though it didn't fit very well,</p>
<p>and for a great variety of other forms of support over the decades,</p>
<p>intellectual, entrepreneurial, and moral.</p>
<p>Aaron, I think the next nine companies will be easier.</p>
<p>Let's hope so.</p>
<p>I'd also like to thank Don Gonson</p>
<p>who has been involved as a sage and insightful legal counsel and business advisor</p>
<p>to all of those companies.</p>
<p>And there are many of you here tonight</p>
<p>who have also worked closely with me over the years.</p>
<p>Inventing is very much a group process.</p>
<p>As Aaron said,</p>
<p>It's really not a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of a crazy <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>
</p>
<p>who disappears into his or her basement</p>
<p>emerging years later with a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Usually I steal Aaron's thunder, which I guess is why</p>
<p>he wanted to speak first.</p>
<p>But you left out the punch line.</p>
<p>Actually, it's a group of crazy inventors</p>
<p>who disappear into their basement.</p>
<p>And we have worked in some basements over the years,</p>
<p>although recently the offices have been a little nicer.</p>
<p>But I'd like to thank all of my colleagues here this evening</p>
<p>who have contributed in a myriad of ways.</p>
<p>And I'd also like to thank all of you this evening</p>
<p>for your support of this worthwhile cause.</p>
<p>The Jewish National Fund asked me</p>
<p>what I'd like to do with the money</p>
<p>that we've raised this evening.</p>
<p>I think we decided</p>
<p>that Israel has enough trees for the moment,</p>
<p>and that a more important issue today is water.</p>
<p>We have to water all those trees for one thing.</p>
<p>And water is a critical issue today in the Middle East.</p>
<p>I was chatting about water two days ago with Ed Roberts,</p>
<p>who's been a mentor to Aaron and many others over the years,</p>
<p>and who's here this evening.</p>
<p>Ed described a plane flight he took flying over Egypt,</p>
<p>and being impressed at the lush green countryside he saw below,</p>
<p>when suddenly it turned into white desert.</p>
<p>That's where the water ended.</p>
<p>In the arid lands of the Middle East,</p>
<p>water is the vital resource underlying all of the agriculture</p>
<p>and much of the economy.</p>
<p>New technologies being pioneered in Israel</p>
<p>will enable the relatively plentiful salt water in the region</p>
<p>to be turned into usable water for drinking and agriculture.</p>
<p>So I'm hopeful our contribution this evening</p>
<p>will make a difference to all of the economies of this critical region of the world.</p>
<p>Water is also an important ingredient</p>
<p>in our mutual goal of peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>Despite all of the tension in that region of the world,</p>
<p>you might be interested to know</p>
<p>that Israel and Egypt have been peacefully cooperating</p>
<p>in sharing their mutual water resources.</p>
<p>The same is true of Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>And even Israel and Syria</p>
<p>have peacefully worked out their water arrangements.</p>
<p>So peaceful cooperation is quite possible</p>
<p>when the will to work together is there.</p>
<p>The key resource that we need</p>
<p>to build a peaceful and prosperous world</p>
<p>is tolerance of each other's differences.</p>
<p>The two great wars of the last sixty years --</p>
<p>the second World War,</p>
<p>and the Cold war,</p>
<p>were fought against intolerance,</p>
<p>against intolerant totalitarian and extremist regimes</p>
<p>of the right and left</p>
<p>representing fundamentalist secular ideologies.</p>
<p>We're now engaged in another war</p>
<p>with another fundamentalist movement,</p>
<p>this time religiously based,</p>
<p>but no less intolerant</p>
<p>than the ones we vanquished in the last century.</p>
<p>I grew up with a religious <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>
</p>
<p>that emphasized tolerance,</p>
<p>and the idea that there are many paths to the truth.</p>
<p>The only thing we were taught to be intolerant of</p>
<p>was intolerance itself,</p>
<p>which sounds a little like Roosevelt's maxim about fear.</p>
<p>The idea was that the true essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>
</p>
<p>is so profound</p>
<p>that our view and <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of it</p>
<p>can necessarily only express</p>
<p>a small aspect of the world's grandeur.</p>
<p>Thus seemingly incompatible ideas</p>
<p>may nonetheless all be accurate reflections</p>
<p>of the same eternal truths.</p>
<p>The ability to reconcile</p>
<p>the apparent contradictions</p>
<p>of different philosophies and religious traditions</p>
<p>is the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/transcendence_entry.html">transcendence</a>
</p>
<p>reflected in what are essentially ineffable realities.</p>
<p>So as a child</p>
<p>I was keenly interested in all of the major religions</p>
<p>because I felt they all could shed some light</p>
<p>on why we are here</p>
<p>and what we're supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>The essence of the recent assault on our nation</p>
<p>was an attack on the very idea of tolerance,</p>
<p>on the notion that there is more than one way to live our lives.</p>
<p>It was also an attack on modernity,</p>
<p>on all of the changes that have taken place in human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>,</p>
<p>at least since the seventh century.</p>
<p>And I don't believe it will be the last such struggle</p>
<p>With the accelerating pace of change --</p>
<p>and those of you who have heard me speak before</p>
<p>know that I can't speak for more than three minutes</p>
<p>without mentioning the word accelerating --</p>
<p>we will see other confrontations,</p>
<p>some violent,</p>
<p>on the idea of modernity.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are valid,</p>
<p>and increasingly compelling, issues</p>
<p>of how to reconcile the exponentially increasing power of our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>
</p>
<p>with the panoply of human needs,</p>
<p>and human values,</p>
<p>if only we could reach a consensus</p>
<p>on what those values are.</p>
<p>We won't settle all these issues this evening,</p>
<p>but contributing to the basic resource of water in the Middle East</p>
<p>is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Thank you once again</p>
<p>for joining me this evening,</p>
<p>for your support,</p>
<p>and for this beautiful award.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> Ray is an ispirational thinker and I'm grateful he's reaching out to the public about what's comming. If we're to survive, we need to build community and solidarity between the currently desperate and the well-heeled. 40 years ago, legendary physicist Richard Feynman outlined simple engineering projects that would have alleviated most human misery, but the power-mad ignored him. So now we have 60% of the US economy devoted to consumer tripe while a billion humans don't even have access to clean water.
<br>
  More technology without simple justice is a recipee for a new Dark Age.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Giving people "simple justice" is a more difficult problem than we think, as we are about to find out in our effor to give it to Afhanistan.
<br>
<br>
Example: hundreds of thousands of tons of food and tents are stacked up in Uzbekistan waiting to cross a bridge the government doesn't want opened.
<br>
<br>
More thousands are waiting to be sent to Kabul, but bandits are stealing everything that travels over that highway.
<br>
<br>
Some tribes have already taken the food that was stored in Mazer-a-Sharif and sold it on the black market. 
<br>
<br>
None of the tribes in Southern Afghanistan want another tribe to be in charge, so nothing useful gets done.
<br>
<br>
These problems have to be solved before any technology can be used to make the lives of the people better.  Afghanistan is not alone in suffering from these problems.  They can't be solved with AI, biotechnology, or nanotech.  
<br>
<br>
So what is the solution?</p></td>
