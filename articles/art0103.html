<div class="TeaserText">The complexities of the mind mirror the challenges of Artificial Intelligence. This article discusses the nature of thought itself--can it be replicated in a machine? From Ray Kurzweil's revolutionary book The Age of Intelligent Machines, published in 1990.</div>
<br>
<br><p>At a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is advancing at a breakneck pace and when <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> developers are glibly hawking their wares as having <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, the inevitable question has begun to take on a certain urgency: Can a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> think? <i>Really</i> think? In one form or another this is actually a very old question, dating back to such philosophers as <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>, and Descartes. And after nearly 3,000 years the most honest answer is still "Who knows?" After all, what does it mean to think? On the other hand, that's not a very satisfying answer. So let's try some others.</p>
<p>
<i>Who cares?</i> If a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can do its job extremely well, what does it <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> if it <i>really</i> thinks? No one runs around asking if taxicabs really walk.</p>
<p>
<i>How could you ever tell?</i> This attitude is the basis of the famous <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, devised in 1950 by the British mathematician and logician <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>: Imagine that you're sitting alone in a room with a teletype <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that is connected at the other end to either a person or a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. If no amount of questioning or conversation allows you to tell which it is, then you have to concede that a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can think.</p>
<p>
<i>No, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is too complicated.</i> Even if we someday come to understand all the laws and principles that govern the mind, that doesn't mean that we can duplicate it. Does understanding astrophysics mean that we can build a <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>?</p>
<p>
<i>Yes, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can think in principle, but not necessarily in the same way we do.</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er Seymour Papert of the Massachusetts Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> maintains that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to artificial flight: 'This leads us to imagine skeptics who would say, 'You mathematicians deal with idealized fluids--the real atmosphere is vastly more complicated: or 'You have no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to suppose that airplanes and birds work the same way-birds have no propellers, airplanes have no feathers.' But the premises of these criticisms is true only in the most superficial sense: the same principles (for example, Bernoulli's law) applies to real as well as ideal fluids, and they apply whether the fluid flows over a feather or an aluminum wing."</p>
<p>
<i>No!</i> This is the most often heard answer, and the most heartfelt. "I am not a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> [goes the argument]. I'm <i>me.</i> I'm alive. And you're never going to make a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that can say that. Furthermore, the essence of humanity isn't <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> or any of the other things that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can do: it's <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, sensuality, and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>. So how can a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> think if it does not feel, and how can it feel if it knows nothing of <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, anguish, exhilaration, loneliness, and all the rest of what it means to be a living <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes when my children were still little," writes former <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT, "my wife and I would stand over them as they lay sleeping in their beds. We spoke to each other only in silence, rehearsing a scene as old as mankind itself. It is as Ionesco told his journal: 'Not everything is unsayable in words, only the living truth: "</p><h1>Can a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> Be Aware?</h1><p>As this last answer suggests, the case against <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> always comes down to the ultimate mystery, which goes by many names: <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, awareness, <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. We don't even understand what it is in humans. Many people would say that it is beyond our understanding entirely, that it is a subject best left to <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> alone. Other people simply wonder if a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> can ever understand itself, even in principle. But either way, how can we ever hope to reproduce it, whatever it is, with a pile of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>?</p>
<p>That question has been the source of endless debate since the rise of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, a debate made all the hotter by the fact that people aren't arguing <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. They're arguing philosophical ideology-their personal beliefs about what the true theory of the mind will be like when we find it.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the philosophical landscape is rugged and diverse. But it's possible to get some feel for the overall topography 6y looking at two extremes. At one extreme at the heart of classical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> we find the doctrines first <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> down in the 1950s by <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> pioneers Allen Newell and Herbert Simon at Carnegie-Mellon University: (1) <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing; (2) <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing is <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, which is the manipulation of symbols; and (3) symbols, because of their relationships and linkages, mean something about the external world. In other words, the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> per se doesn't <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, and Turing was right: a perfect simulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.</p>
<p>Tufts University philosopher Daniel <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Dennett, a witty and insightful observer of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, has dubbed this position High Church <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>alism. Its prelates include such establishment figures as Simon and MIT's <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>; its Vatican City is MIT, "the East Pole."</p>
<p>Then from out of the West comes heresy--a creed that is not an alternative so much as a denial. As Dennett describes it, the assertion is that "<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is something going on in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> all right, but it is not <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> at all: <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is something holistic and emergent-and organic and fuzzy and warn and cuddly and mysterious."</p>
<p>Dennett calls this creed <a class="thought" href="entries/zen_entry.html">Zen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/holism_entry.html">holism</a>. And for some <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> its proponents do seem to cluster in the San Francisco Bay area. Among them are the gurus of the movement: Berkeley philosophers <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a> and Hubert Dreyfus.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>alists and the holists have been going at it for years, ever since Dreyfus first denounced <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> in the mid 1960s with his caustic book <i>What <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s Can't Do</i>. But their definitive battle came in 1980, in the pages of the journal <i>Behavioral and </i><a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a><i> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>s</i>. This journal is unique among scientific journals in that it doesn't just publish an article; first it solicits commentary from the author's peers and gives the author a chance to write a rebuttal. Then it publishes the whole thing as a package-a kind of formal debate in print. In this case the centerpiece was Searle's article "Minds, Brains, and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>s," a stinging attack on the idea that a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could think. Following it were 27 responses, most of which were stinging attacks on Searle. The whole thing is worth reading for its entertainment value alone. But it also highlights the fundamental issues with a clarity that has never been surpassed.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a></h1><p>Essentially, Searle's point was that simulation is not duplication. A <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that uses formal rules to manipulate abstract symbols can never think or be aware, because those symbols don't mean anything to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>To illustrate, he proposed the following <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> experiment as a parody of the typical <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>-understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> of his day: "Suppose that I'm locked in a room and given a large batch of Chinese writing," he said. "Suppose furthermore (as is indeed the case) that I know no Chinese .... To me, the Chinese writing is just so many meaningless squiggles." Next, said Searle, he is given a second batch of Chinese writing (a "story"), together with some rules in English that explain how to correlate the first batch with the second (a "<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>"). Then after this is all done, he is given yet a third <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of Chinese symbols ("questions"), together with yet more English rules that tell him how to manipulate the slips of paper until all three batches are correlated, and how to produce a new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of Chinese characters ("answers"), which he then passes back out of the room. Finally, said Searle, "after awhile I get so good at manipulating the instructions for the Chinese symbols and the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers get so good at writing the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that from the external point of view . . . my answers to the questions are absolutely indistinguishable from those of native Chinese speakers." In other words, Searle learns to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> in Chinese.</p>
<p>Now, according to the zealots of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>, said Searle, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that can answer questions in this way isn't just simulating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> abilities. It is literally understanding the story. Moreover, the operation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is in fact an explanation of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> understanding.</p>
<p>And yet, said Searle, while he is locked in that imaginary room he is doing exactly what the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> does. He uses formal rules to manipulate abstract symbols. He takes in stories and gives out answers exactly as a native Chinese would. But he <i>still doesn't understand a word of Chinese</i>. So how is it possible to say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> understands? In fact, said Searle, it doesn't. For comparison, imagine that the questions and the answers now <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> to English. So far as the people outside the room are concerned, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is just as fluent as before. And yet there's all the difference in the world, because now he isn't just manipulating formal symbols anymore. He understands what's being said. The words have meaning for him-or, in the technical jargon of <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, he has <i>intentionality</i>. Why? "Because I am a certain sort of organism with a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> (i.e., chemical and physical/ structure," he said, "and this structure, under certain conditions, is causally capable of producing perception, <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, understanding, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, and other intentional phenomena." In other words, Searle concluded that it is certainly possible for a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to think-"in an important <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> our bodies with our brains are precisely such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s"-but only if the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is as complex and as powerful as the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. A purely formal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> cannot do it.</p><h1>Counterarguments</h1><p>Searle's Chinese roam clearly struck a sensitive <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a>, as evidenced by the number and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of the denunciations that followed. It was clear to everyone that when Searle used the word "intentionality," he wasn't just talking about an obscure technical <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> intentionality is virtually synonymous with mind, <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, or awareness. Here is a sampler of some of the main objections:</p>
<p>
<i>The comparison is unfair</i>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that Searle ridiculed demonstrated a very crude kind of understanding at best, and no one in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> seriously claims anything more for them. Even if they were correct in principle, said the defenders, genuine humanlike understanding would require much more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and much more sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s.</p>
<p>Searle quite correctly painted out, however, that this argument is irrelevant: of course <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are getting more powerful: what he objected to was the principle.</p>
<p>
<i>The </i><a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese Room</a><i> story is entertaining and seductive, but it's a fraud</i>. Douglas R. Hofstadter of Indiana University, author of the best-selling <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i>, pointed out that the jump from the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is not the trivial step that Searle makes it out to be. It's an enormous leap. The poor devil in the <a class="thought" href="entries/chinese_room_entry.html">Chinese room</a> would have to shuffle not just a few slips of paper but millions or billions of slips of paper. It would take him years to answer a question, if he could do it at all. In effect, said Hofstadter, Searle is postulating mental processes slowed down by a factor of millions, so no wonder it looks different.</p>
<p>Searle's reply-that he could memorize the slips of paper and shuffle them in his head-sounds plausible enough. But as several respondents have pointed out, it dangerously undermines his whole argument: once he memorizes everything, doesn't he now understand Chinese in the same way he understands English?</p>
<p>
<i>The entire <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> does understand Chinese</i>. True, the man in the room doesn't understand Chinese himself. But he is just part of a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that also includes the slips of paper, the rules, and the message-passing mechanism. Taken as a whole, this larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> does understand Chinese. This "<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s" reply was advanced by a number of the respondents. Searle was incredulous-"It is not easy for me to imagine how someone who was not in the grip of an ideology could find the idea at all plausible"-yet the concept is subtler than it seems. Consider a thermostat: a bimetallic strip bends and unbends as the temperature changes. When the room becomes too cold, the strip closes an electrical connection, and the furnace kicks on. When the room warms back up again, the connection reopens, and the furnace shuts off. Now, does the bimetallic strip by itself control the temperature of the room? No. Does the furnace by itself control the temperature? No. Does the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> as a whole control the temperature? Yes. Connections and the organization make the whole into mare than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>
<i>Searle never makes clear what intentionality is, or why a </i><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a><i> can't have it</i>. As Dennett pointed out, "For Searle, intentionality is rather like a wonderful substance secreted by the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> the way the pancreas secretes insulin." And make no mistake: Searle's concept of intentionality does require a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. He explicitly denied that a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> could have intentionality, even if it were equipped with eyes, ears, arms, legs, and all the other accoutrements it needed to move around and perceive the world like a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being. Inside, he said, the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> would still just be manipulating formal symbols.</p>
<p>That assertion led psychologist Zenon Pylyshyn of the University of Western Ontario to propose his own ironic <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> experiment: 'Thus, if more and more of the cells in your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> were to be replaced by <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> chips, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med in such a way as to keep the input-output <i>function</i> of each unit identical to the unit being replaced, you would in all likelihood just keep right on speaking exactly as you are doing now except that you would eventually stop <i>meaning</i> anything by it. What we outside observers might take to be words would become for you just certain noises that <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s caused you to make." In short, you would become a zombie.</p>
<p>Dennett took up the same theme in his own article. So far as natural selection is concerned, he pointed out, Pylyshyn's zombie or Searle's <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> is just as fit for survival as those of us with Searlestyle intentional brains. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> would make no distinction. Indeed, from a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> point of view, intentionality is irrelevant, as useless as the appendix. So how did it ever arise? And having arisen, how did it survive and prosper when it offered no natural-selection value? Aren't we lucky that some chance mutation didn't rob our ancestors of intentionality? Dennett asked. If it had, he said, "we'd behave just as we do now, but of course we wouldn't mean it!" Needless to say, bath Pylyshyn and Dennett found this absurd.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the great debate has to be rated a standoff. Searle, not surprisingly, was unconvinced by any of his opponents' arguments; to this day he and his fellow <a class="thought" href="entries/zen_entry.html">Zen</a> holists have refused to yield an inch. Yet they have never given a truly compelling explanation of why a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and only a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> can secrete intentionality. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>alists, meanwhile, remain convinced that they are succeeding where philosophers have failed for 3,000 years-that they are producing a real scientific theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. But they can't prove it. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>And in all fairness, the burden of proof is on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. The symbol-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> is an intriguing approach. If nothing else, it's an approach worth exploring to see how far it can go. But still, what is <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>?</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> as a Message of Despair</h1><p>One way to answer that last question is with another question: Do we really want to know? Many people <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>ively side with Searle, horrified at what the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>alist position implies: If <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, feeling, <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, and all the other workings of the mind can be understood even in principle, if <i>we</i> are <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, then <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> is not speaking to our hearts. And for that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, neither is Mozart. The <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> is nothing more than the activations of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al symbols. <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a> is nothing more than a surge of hormones and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s. Meaning and purpose are illusions. And besides, when <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s grow old and break dawn, they are discarded without a <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Thus, for many people, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is a message of despair. Of course, this is hardly a new concern. For those who choose to see it that way, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> itself is a message of despair.</p>
<p>In 1543 with the publication of <i>De Revolutionibus</i> the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus moved the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> from the center of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and made it one <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> among many and thereby changed humankind's relationship with <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. In the earthcentered <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of Thomas Aquinas and other medieval theologians, man had been poised halfway between a heaven that lay just beyond the sphere of the stars and a hell that burned beneath his feet. He had dwelt always under the watchful eye of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, and his <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual status had been reflected in the very structure of the cosmos. But after Copernicus the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> and man were reduced to being wanderers in an infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. For many, the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of lass and confusion were palpable.</p>
<p>In 1859 with the publication of <i>The Origin of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">Species</a></i> <a class="thought" href="entries/darwin_entry.html">Charles Darwin</a> described how one group of living things arises from another through natural selection and thereby changed our perception of who we are. Once man had been the special creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, the favored of all his children. Now man was just another <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>, the descendent of monkeys.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth with the publication of such works as The Interpretation of Dreams (1901), Sigmund Freud illuminated the inner workings of the mind and again changed our perception of who we are. Once we had been only a little lower than the angels, masters of our own souls. Now we were at the mercy of demons like rage, terror, and lust, made all the more hideous by the fact that they lived unseen in our own unconscious minds.</p>
<p>So the message of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> can be bleak indeed. It can be seen as a proclamation that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings are nothing more than masses of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s collected by blind chance and governed by immutable physical law, that we have no meaning, that there is no purpose to existence, and that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> just doesn't care. I suspect that this is the real <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for the creationists' desperate rejection of Darwin. It has nothing to do with Genesis; it has everything to do with being special in the eyes of a caring <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. The fact that their creed is based on ignorance and a willful distortion of the evidence makes them both sad and dangerous. But their longing for <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> and purpose in the world is understandable and even noble. I also suspect that this perceived <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> lies behind the fascination so many people feel for such pseudosciences as astrology. After all, if the stars and the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s guide my <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a>, then somehow I <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> cares. Astrology makes no scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> whatsoever. But far those who need such reassurance, what can <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> offer to replace it?</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> as a Message of Hope</h1><p>And yet the message doesn't have to be bleak. <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> has given us a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of enormous extent filled with marvels far beyond anything Aquinas ever knew. Does it diminish the night sky to know that the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s are other worlds and that the stars are other suns? In the same way, a scientific theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and awareness might very well provide us with an understanding of other possible minds. Perhaps it will show us more clearly how our Western ways of perceiving the world relate to the perceptions of other cultures. Perhaps it will tell us how <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> fits in with the range of other possible <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s that might exist in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Perhaps it will give us a new insight into who we are and what our place is in creation.</p>
<p>Indeed, far from being threatening, the prospect is oddly comforting. Consider a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. It is undeniably a natural phenomenon, the product of physical forces pushing <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s here and there through a web of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> and metal. And yet a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is mare than just a surge of <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s. Take the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and run it on another kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Now the structure of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> and metal is completely different. The way the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s move is completely different. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> itself is the same, because it still does the same thing. h is part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. It needs the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to exist. And yet it transcends the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. In effect, the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> occupies a different level of reality from the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Hence the power of the symbol-processing model: By describing the mind as a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> running on a flesh-and-blood <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, it shows us how feeling, purpose, <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, and awareness can be part of the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and yet transcend the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. It shows us how the mind can be composed of simple, comprehensible processes and still be something more.</p>
<p>Consider a living <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. The individual enzymes, lipids, and <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that go to make up a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> are comparatively simple things. They obey well-understood laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>.</p>
<p>There is no way to point to any one of them and say, "This is alive." And yet when all those <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are brought together in an exquisitely ordered pattern, they are <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. In the same way our minds are perhaps nothing more than <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Does that mean there is no such thing as <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>? Perhaps we are just processors of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al symbols. Perhaps a snowflake is only a collection of water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. Perhaps The <i>Magic Flute</i> is only a sequence of sound waves. And perhaps, in illuminating the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of mind and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is only reaffirming how unique and precious the mind really is.</p>
