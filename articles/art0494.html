<div class="TeaserText">Countering Michael Denton's vitalist objection that self-organizing, self-replicating, morphing, holistic forms can only be created by biological processes and that machines are necessarily deterministic and predictable, Ray Kurzweil points out that software-based, self-organizing, chaotic processes (such as genetic algorithms) can exhibit unpredictable, emergent properties and create complex original designs. Furthermore, the complexity of this "evolutionary engineering" is increasing exponentially and will match the complexity of human intelligence in a few decades, he adds.</div>

<h2>The Bridge is Already Under Construction </h2>
<p></p>
<p>Similar to Dembski, Denton points out the apparent differences 
              between the design principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities (e.g., people) 
              and those of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s he has known. Denton eloquently describes 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s as &#8220;self-organizing, . . . self-referential, . . 
              . self-replicating, . . . reciprocal, . . . self-formative, and 
              . . . holistic.&#8221; He then makes the unsupported leap, a leap 
              of faith one might say, that such organic forms can only be created 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes, and that such forms are &#8220;immutable, 
              . . . impenetrable, and . . . fundamental&#8221; realities of <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. 
            </p>
<p>I do share Denton&#8217;s &#8220;awestruck&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of &#8220;wonderment&#8221; 
              at the <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>, intricacy, strangeness, and inter-relatedness of 
              organic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, ranging from the &#8220;eerie other-worldly impression&#8221; 
              of asymmetric <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> shapes to the extraordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of 
              higher-<a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> organs such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Further, I agree with 
              Denton that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> design represents a profound <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of principles. 
              However, it is precisely my thesis, which neither Denton nor the 
              other critics represented in this book acknowledge nor respond to, 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (i.e., entities derivative of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> directed design) 
              can use&#8212;and already are using&#8212;these same principles. This 
              has been the thrust of my own work, and in my view represents the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Emulating the ideas of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> is the most effective 
              way to harness the enormous powers that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will make 
              available. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of holistic design is not an either-or category, but 
              rather a continuum. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are not completely holistic 
              nor are contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s completely modular. We can identify 
              units of functionality in natural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s even at the molecular 
              level, and discernible mechanisms of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> are even more evident 
              at the higher level of organs and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions. As I pointed out 
              in my response to Searle, the process of understanding the functionality 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> transformations performed in specific <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions 
              is well under way. It is misleading to suggest that every aspect 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> interacts with every other aspect, and that it 
              is thereby impossible to understand its <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a>, for 
              example, has identified and modeled the transformations of auditory 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in more than two dozen small regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              Conversely, there are many examples of contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in 
              which many of the design aspects are deeply interconnected and in 
              which &#8220;bottom up&#8221; design is impossible. As one example 
              of many, General Electric uses &#8220;genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s&#8221; to 
              evolve the design of its jet <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s as they have found it impossible 
              to optimize the hundreds of deeply interacting variables in any 
              other way. </p>
<p>Denton writes:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Today almost all professional biologists have adopted 
              the mechanistic/<a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist approach and assume that the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 
              parts of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> (like the cogs of a watch) are the primary 
              essential things, that a living <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> (like a watch) is no more 
              than the sum of its parts, and that it is the parts that determine 
              the properties of the whole and that (like a watch) a complete description 
              of all the properties of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> may be had by characterizing 
              its parts in isolation.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What Denton is ignoring here is the ability of complex processes 
              to exhibit emergent properties which go beyond &#8220;its parts in 
              isolation.&#8221; Denton appears to recognize this potential in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              when he writes: &#8220;In a very real <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organic forms . . . represent 
              genuinely emergent realities.&#8221; However, it is hardly necessary 
              to resort to Denton&#8217;s &#8220;vitalistic model&#8221; to explain 
              emergent realities. Emergent properties derive from the power of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, and there is nothing that restricts <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s and their 
              emergent properties to natural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>Denton appears to acknowledge the feasibility of emulating the 
              ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, when he writes:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Success in <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering new organic forms from <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s 
              up to <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s will therefore require a completely <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> approach, 
              a sort of designing from &#8216;the top down.&#8217; Because the parts 
              of organic wholes only exist in the whole, organic wholes cannot 
              be specified <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> and built up from a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of relatively independent 
              modules; consequently the entire undivided unity must be specified 
              together in toto.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here Denton provides sound advice and describes an approach to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering that I and other <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers use routinely in the areas 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> (also called <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>) theory, and 
              self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Denton appears to be unaware of these <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies 
              and after describing examples of bottom-up <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>-driven <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              and their limitations concludes with no justification that there 
              is an unbridgeable chasm between the two design philosophies. The 
              bridge is already under construction. </p>

<h2>How to Create Your Own &#8220;Eerie Other-Worldly&#8221; But Effective 
              Designs: Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>In my book I describe how to apply the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              to creating intelligent designs. It is an effective <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology 
              for problems that contain too many intricately interacting aspects 
              to design using the conventional modular approach. We can, for example, 
              create (in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) millions of competing designs, each with 
              their own &#8220;genetic&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. The genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> for each of 
              these design &#8220;organisms&#8221; describes a potential solution 
              to the problem. Applying the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>, these <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up to compete with each other and the most successful 
              are allowed to survive and to procreate. &#8220;Offspring&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              entities are created, each of which inherits the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> (i.e., 
              the design <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s) of two parents. Mutations and other &#8220;environmental 
              challenges&#8221; are also introduced. After thousands of generations 
              of such simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, these <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s often produce 
              complex original designs. In my own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with this approach, 
              the results produced by <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s are well described by 
              Denton&#8217;s description of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the &#8220;apparent 
              illogic of the design and the lack of any obvious modularity or 
              regularity&#8230;the sheer <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> of the arrangement&#8230;[and the] 
              almost eerie other-worldly non-mechanical impression.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">Genetic algorithm</a>s and other <i>top-down</i> self-organizing design 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies (e.g., neural nets, <a class="thought" href="entries/markov_model_entry.html">Markov model</a>s) incorporate an 
              unpredictable <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>, so that the results of such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are actually 
              different every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the process is run. Despite the common <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are deterministic and therefore predictable, there 
              are numerous readily available sources of randomness available to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Contemporary theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> postulate profound 
              quantum randomness at the core of <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. According to quantum 
              theory, what appears to be the deterministic behavior of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              at a macro level is simply the result of overwhelming statistical 
              preponderancies based on enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of fundamentally unpredictable 
              events. Moreover, the work of Stephen Wolfram and others has demonstrated 
              that even a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that is in theory fully deterministic can nonetheless 
              produce effectively random results. </p>
<p>The results of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s and similar &#8220;self-organizing&#8221; 
              approaches create designs which could not have been designed through 
              a modular <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>-driven approach. The &#8220;strangeness. . . 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, . . . the dynamic interaction&#8221; of parts to the whole 
              that Denton <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s only to organic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s describe very 
              well the qualities of the results of these <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> initiated chaotic 
              processes. </p>
<p>In my own work with <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s, I have examined the process 
              in which a <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a> gradually improves a design. It accomplishes 
              this precisely through an incremental &#8220;all at once&#8221; approach, 
              making many small, distributed changes throughout the design which 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ively improve the overall fit or &#8220;power&#8221; of the 
              solution. A <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a> does not accomplish its design achievements 
              through designing <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> subsystems one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The entire 
              solution emerges gradually, and unfolds from simplicity to <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. 
              The solutions it produces are often asymmetric and ungainly, but 
              effective, just as in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Often, the solutions appear elegant 
              and even beautiful. </p>
<p>Denton is certainly correct that most contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are 
              designed using the modular approach. It is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to note that 
              there are certain significant <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering advantages to this traditional 
              approach to creating <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have far 
              more prodigious and accurate memories than humans, and can perform 
              certain types of transformations far more effectively than unaided 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can share their 
              memories and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s instantly. The chaotic non-modular approach 
              also has clear advantages which Denton well articulates, as evidenced 
              by the deep prodigious powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. But 
              it is a wholly unjustified leap to say that because of the current 
              (and diminishing!) limitations of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-directed <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are inherently, even ontologically, a world apart. 
              The exquisite designs of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> have benefited from a profound <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process. Our most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s today incorporate genetic 
              codes of thousands of bits whereas <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities such as humans 
              are characterized by genetic codes of billions of bits (although 
              it appears that as a result of massive redundancies and other inefficiencies, 
              only a few percent of our <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is actually utilized). However, 
              as is the case with all <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>

              If we examine the rate at which the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s 
              and other <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>-inspired <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies are increasing, we find 
              that they will match the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> within

<h2>To Fold a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Denton points out we have not yet succeeded in folding <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s 
              in three dimensions, &#8220;even one consisting of only 100 <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s.&#8221; 
              It should be pointed out, however, that it is only in the recent 
              few years that we have had the tools even to visualize these three-dimensional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. Moreover, modeling the interatomic forces will require 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a million billion calculations per second, which 
              is beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of even the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s available 
              today. But <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with this <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> are expected soon. IBM&#8217;s 
              &#8220;Blue Gene&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, scheduled for <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> in 2005, 
              will have precisely this <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, and as the name of the project 
              suggests, is targeted at the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-folding task. </p>
<p>We have already succeeded in cutting, splicing, and rearranging 
              genetic codes, and harnessing <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>&#8217;s own biochemical factories 
              to produce enzymes and other complex <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> substances. It is 
              true that most contemporary work of this type is done in two dimensions, 
              but the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources to visualize and model 
              the far more complex three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              is not far from realization. </p>
<p>In discussing the prospects for solving the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-folding problem 
              with Denton himself, he acknowledged that the problem would eventually 
              be solved, estimating that it was perhaps a decade away. The fact 
              that a certain technical feat has not yet been accomplished is not 
              a strong argument that it never will. </p>

<p>Although Denton&#8217;s observation above is essentially correct, 
              this only points out that the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> is only part of the overall 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> is not the whole story, and the rest of the

              it to be understood. </p>
<p>I should also point out that my thesis on recreating the massively

              fold <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. There are dozens of contemporary projects which have 
              succeeded in creating detailed recreations of neurological <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, 
              including <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s which successfully function inside people&#8217;s 
              brains, without folding any <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. However, I understand Denton&#8217;s 
              argument about <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s to be an essay on the holistic ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. 
              But as I have pointed out, there are no essential barriers to our 
              emulating these ways in our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and we are already well 
              down this path. </p>

<p></p>
<p>First of all, we do have a new form of self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> 
              that is <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-made, and which did not exist a short while ago, namely 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (or <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> self-replicating 
              entities require a medium in which to reproduce, viruses require 
              the medium of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s known as the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. As far as changing form is concerned, some of the more 
              advanced and recent <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses demonstrate this characteristic. 
              Moreover, morphing form is precisely what happens in the case of 
              the reproducing designs created by <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s. Whereas most 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> viruses reproduce asexually, the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> 
              harnessed in most <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s is sexual (i.e., utilizing 
              two &#8220;parents&#8221; such that each offspring inherits a portion 
              of its genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> from each parent). If the conditions are right, 
              these evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s do morph themselves into different 
              forms, indeed into increasingly complex forms that provide increasingly 
              greater power in solving nontrivial problems. And lest anyone think 
              that there is an inherent difference between these evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              entities and actual physical entities, it should be pointed out 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> entities created through <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s often 
              do represent the designs of physical entities such as <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s or 
              even of robots, as recently demonstrated by scientists at Tufts. 
              Conversely, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> physical entities such as humans are also 
              characterized by the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> contained in their genetic codes. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a>s, which I described in the first chapter of this book, 
              will also provide the ability to create morphing <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s in the 
              physical world. J.D. Storrs, for example, has provided designs of 
              special <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, which he calls &#8220;foglets,&#8221; which will 
              eventually be capable of organizing and reorganizing themselves 
              into any type of physical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, thereby bringing the morphing

              resembling that of man.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all, my positions are neither concessions nor confessions. 
              Our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> today is essentially where I had expected it to be 
              by this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when I wrote a book (<i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a></i>) 
              describing the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> in the 1980s. Once again, 
              Denton&#8217;s accurate observation about the limitations of today&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s is not a compelling argument on inherent restrictions that 
              can never be overcome. Denton himself acknowledges the quickening 
              pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that is moving &#8220;at an ever-accelerating 
              rate one technological advance [following] another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denton is also oversimplifying my argument in the same way that 
              Searle does. It is not my position that once we have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with 
              a computing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> comparable to that of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, that 
              &#8220;of course such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will equal or surpass the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              of man.&#8221; I state explicitly in the first chapter of this book 
              and in many different ways in my book <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i> 
              that &#8220;this level of processing power is a necessary but not 
              sufficient condition for achieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.&#8221; The bulk of my thesis addresses the issue of how 
              the combined power of exponentially increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, and other accelerating <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              capabilities, will enable us to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er, that is to understand, 
              and then to recreate in other forms, the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, Denton appears to be equating the issue of &#8220;<i>exhibit[ing] 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a></i>&#8221; with the issue of &#8220;<i>equal[ing] the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> ability of humans</i>.&#8221; Without repeating the arguments 
              I presented in both the first chapter of this book and in my response 
              to Searle, I will say that these issues are quite distinct. The 
              latter issue represents a <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive capability, 
              whereas the former issue represents the essence of <i>subjective</i>
<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In summary, Denton is far too quick to conclude that complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in the physical world are incapable of exhibiting 
              the &#8220;emergent . . . vital characteristics of <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s such 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, &#8220;morphing,&#8221; self-regeneration, self-assembly 
              and the holistic <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> design,&#8221; and that, therefore, 
              &#8220;organisms and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s belong to different categories of being.&#8221; 
              Dembski and Denton share the same limited view of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s as entities 
              that can only be designed and constructed in a modular way. We can

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'm enjoying these essays immensely.  So far I've read Searle's and Denton's critiques and Kurzweil's responses to them, and I've been trying to anticipate Kurzweil's responses before reading them.  So far, I've been pretty near the mark, which pleases me, as I interpret this to mean that I understand his position in some depth.  For a layman, this is a very satisfying experience!

I think the fact that emergent phenomena are the result of patterns is one of the most frequently-misunderstood and ignored issues in discussions such as these.  People don't seem to have the vision or the imagination to grasp that complexity -- even Holistic complexity -- can still be generated from simple processes.</p></td>
