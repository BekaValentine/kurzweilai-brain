<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net August 10, 2003, based on an award 
              presentation at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614003706/http://www.telluridetechfestival.com/about_techfest.html" target="_blank">Fourth 
              Annual Telluride Tech Festival</a>.</i></p>
<p>It's a great pleasure for me to present&#8212;albeit virtually&#8212;the 
              2003 <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> Award of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614003706/http://web.media.mit.edu/~tod/" target="_blank">Tod 
              Machover</a>. </p>
<p> I've known Tod for over a decade through our mutual ties to the 
              MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> our paths cross, I am reminded how unique 
              Tod is in the extraordinary range of his contributions. He is the 
              only person I am aware of who contributes on a world-class level 
              to both the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> creation and to <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> itself. Even 
              within these two distinct areas, Tod's contributions are remarkably 
              diverse, and of exquisite quality.</p>
<p> The Los Angeles Times calls Tod Machover "America's most 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> composer." "Brilliantly gifted" says the New 
              York Times. The New Yorker calls him "one of the most innovative 
              and imaginative composers around."</p>
<p> In the area of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, perhaps his best known <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> 
              is that of "hyperinstruments," created at the MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> 
              Lab, where he was one of the founders. Hyperinstruments are <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s that add their own <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to their <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> users. 
              The idea is to use sensors to pick up the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> musician's intent, 
              and then augment and enhance the sounds created using the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>'s own <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. This <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> affects the tonal 
              qualities produced as well as the actual note sequences played. 
              The effect is so compelling that hyperinstruments have been used 
              by a wide array of musicians, from Yo-Yo Ma to Peter Gabriel and 
              Prince. Beyond the immediate impact of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s is the very 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of building <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s that allow the intimate 
              interplay of both <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p> Other projects include <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that allow non-musicians to create 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> games to teach <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> to children.</p>
<p> On the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> creation front, Tod is both an eminently gifted composer 
              and performer. His <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> has been commissioned by many leading institutions, 
              such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, The San Francisco Symphony, 
              Lincoln Center, and the Tokyo String Quartet. He has received many 
              honors for his <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, including France's highest cultural honor 
              and the first DigiGlobe Prize in Interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> from the German 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>. </p>
<p> I had the pleasure of hearing recently his fifth opera, called 
              Resurrection, which was a beautiful and moving <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. Resurrection 
              is particularly interesting because it is a compelling <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> 
              of classical forms and contemporary sounds. His unique interactive 
              "Brain Opera," which combines Tod's interest in both <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, has recently been permanently installed 
              at Vienna's House of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a>.</p>
<p> I could go on for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> describing all of Tod's innovations 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> itself, but I think you get the idea. 
              It is a special honor for me to present this first award to a uniquely 
              creative <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>.</p>

              on Hyperinstruments</a>:</b></p>
<p>The hyperinstrument project was started in 1986 with the goal of 
              designing expanded musical instruments, using technology to give 
              extra power and finesse to virtuosic performers. Such hyperinstruments 
              were designed to augment guitars and keyboards, percussion and strings, 
              and even conducting, and have been used by some of the world's foremost 
              performers... </p>
<p>Since 1992, the focus of the hyperinstrument group has expanded 
              in an attempt to build sophisticated interactive musical instruments 
              for non-professional musicians, students, music lovers, and the 
              general public. Systems such as Drum-Boy and Joystick Music allow 
              non-musicians to shape and create complex and interesting musical 
              pieces by using gestures or word descriptions (such as musical "adjectives") 
              to influence the real-time interactive environment. </p>
<p>Current hyperinstrument research is attempting to push the envelope 
              in both of these directions: by designing high-level professional 
              systems that measure the most subtle and sophisticated human performance; 
              and by building ever-more-powerful, interactive entertainment systems 
              for the general public (such as interactive music games, music learning 
              systems, and Internet-oriented group performance and creation). 
            </p>
<p>The research focus of all this work is on designing computer systems 
              (sensors, signal processing, and software) that measure and interpret 
              human expression and feeling, as well as on exploring the appropriate 
              modalities and innovative content of interactive art and entertainment 
              environments. </p>
<p>We have also expanded the hyperinstrument environment to include 
              gestural and intuitive control of visual media (Laser Rangefinder, 
              Meteorite Museum, Stretchables, etc.). Recent projects involve both 
              new hyperinstruments for children and musical amateurs, and high-end 
              hyperinstruments capable of expanding and transforming a symphony 
              orchestra or an entire opera stage.</p>
