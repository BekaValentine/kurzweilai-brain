<div class="TeaserText">Ray Kurzweil's vision for the 21st century and beyond includes reverse-engineering the human brain and non-biological intelligences.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published December 1, 1999 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613232407/http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/1999/12/01/20503" target="_new">Business2.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>By the second half of the next century, there will be no clear distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Two things will allow this to happen. First, our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brains will be enhanced by <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s. This has already begun. Doctors use <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s to counteract symptoms of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's disease</a>, for instance, and neuroscientists from Emory University School of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> in Atlanta recently placed an electrode into the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of a paralyzed stroke victim who now communicates using a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. In the 2020s, these <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s will not be just for people with disabilities, but will be used to improve our perception, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and logical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, and even create virtual sensory experiences. These implants will plug us directly into the Web. By 2030, "going to a Website" will mean entering a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment. Our implants will generate streams of sensory input that would otherwise come from our real senses, creating an all-encompassing virtual environment that responds to our behavior. This <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will be as realistic, detailed, and subtle as the reality we know today. </p>
<p>Also, we will have created <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> brains, which will extend vastly our own <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains. While our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is, for all practical purposes, at a standstill, our <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is growing at a double-exponential rate. Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s have been consistently multiplying in power from the electromechanical calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s used in the 1890 U.S. Census through today. Along the way there's been <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> speed (per unit cost) doubled every three years between 1910 and 1950, doubled every two years between 1950 and 1966, and is now doubling every year. By the end of the 21st century, <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> will be trillions of times more powerful than that of its <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> progenitors. </p>
<p>There are many new technologies waiting in the wings that will allow this to happen. Nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, for example, are capable of forming extremely dense three-dimensional arrays of computing <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. A 1 inch cube of nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry would be at least a million times more powerful than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Other experimental technologies include <a class="thought" href="entries/three_dimensional_chip_entry.html">three-dimensional chip</a>s, optical computing, <a class="thought" href="entries/crystalline_comp_entry.html">crystalline computing</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. By 2019, a $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will match the processing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>--about 20 million billion calculations per second. By 2029, your average <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> will be equivalent to 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brains.</p><h1>Reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a></h1><p>This level of processing power is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The organization and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of these resources--the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>--is also critical. The most compelling scenario for mastering the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is to reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>--to essentially copy its design--so these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will seem very <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. And through <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, they will have <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like--but greatly enhanced--bodies as well. Having <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> origins, they will claim to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, and to have <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> feelings. And being immensely intelligent, they'll be very convincing when they tell us these things.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning has already started. A condemned killer donated his <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body to be scanned, and you can <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> all 10 billion bytes of him on the Web. We also have noninvasive scanning techniques today, including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (<a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>) scans, <a class="thought" href="entries/optical_imaging_entry.html">optical imaging</a>, and near-infrared scanning. <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> generations of scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will enable us to show the connections between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Ultimately we will be able to peer inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s themselves. &#160; </p>
<p>The most viable approach to scanning the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will be to scan it from inside. By 2030, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be feasible, and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning will be a prominent application. Billions of bots could travel through every capillary of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and scan every detail. The billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s would all be on a high-speed <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> Intranet allowing them to communicate with each other, and with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s compiling the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-scan <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>. From this <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, we will learn how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works, and we'll be able to copy the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural computer</a>.</p><h1>The Web as <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual Reality</a> Arena</h1><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will do more than scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. They will also extend it. One vital application will be full-immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>--a VR induced by the interaction of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s with the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can detect and even control the firing of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s--essentially creating two-way <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and neural <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s (such as the "<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s" demonstrated at Germany's Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry. Scientists have also demonstrated that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s can work together on <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> tasks just like an all-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. &#160; </p>
<p>When we want to experience real reality, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s do nothing. If we want to enter <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they suppress all of the inputs coming from the real senses, and replace them with signals appropriate for the virtual environment. Your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> would then send signals intended to cause your muscles and limbs to move as you normally would, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s again intercept these interneuronal signals, suppress your real limbs from moving, and instead cause your virtual limbs to "move" while providing the appropriate movement and reorientation (as well as sounds and tactile sensations) in the virtual environment. &#160; </p>
<p>The Web will provide a panoply of virtual environments to explore, and "going" to these Web environments will not require any equipment not already in our heads. Some will be recreations of earthly places; others will be fanciful environments that have no "real" counterpart. Some would be virtual worlds that seem to violate laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. Want to fly? Walk on walls like a spider? You can, in this virtual world. We'll be able to visit these virtual Web environments alone, or we'll meet others there, people both real and simulated. Ultimately, there won't be a clear distinction between the two.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will expand our minds in virtually any way imaginable. Our brains today are relatively fixed in design. Although we do add patterns of interneuronal connections and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations as a normal part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process, the overall capacity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is highly constrained (to a mere hundred trillion connections). <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> implants based on massively distributed intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will ultimately expand our memories a trillionfold, and vastly improve all of our sensory, <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> and cognitive abilities. &#160; </p>
<p>Of course, there will be great concern regarding who's controlling the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, and over who the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s may be talking to. Organizations such as <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s or extremist groups or just clever individuals could put trillions of undetectable <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in the water or food supply. These "spy" <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s could then monitor, influence, and even control our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. We won't be defenseless, however. Just as we have <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> today, we will make use of patrol <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for (and destroy) unauthorized <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in our brains and bodies.</p><h1>Beyond the 21st Century</h1><p>Can the pace of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> continue to speed up indefinitely? Will we not reach a point where humans are unable to think fast enough to keep up with it? With regard to unenhanced humans, clearly so. But what would a million scientists, each a thousand times more intelligent than <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> scientists today, and each operating a thousand times faster than contemporary humans (because the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing in their <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>, Web-based brains is faster) accomplish? &#160; </p>
<p>For one thing, they would come up with <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to become even more intelligent (because <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is no longer of fixed capacity). They would change their own <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes to think even faster. When the scientists evolve to be a million times more intelligent and operate a million times faster, then an hour could result in a century of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. &#160; </p>
<p>Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> develops computing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it's only a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of a few centuries before the <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> form of their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> permeates the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in its vicinity, and then expands outward. Ultimately, it becomes capable of maneuvering and controlling cosmological forces through its exquisite and vast <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and creates the world it wants. &#160; </p><h1>What kind of world will that be?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ray mentioned putting nanobots into the food or water to exert control over human behavior.  I think it could be even easier than that.  The necessary DNA code could be inserted into a virus and passed around in much the same way that a strain of flu sweeps around the world in a matter of days.  Once inside the body, the DNA code could use the body's own materials to build the controls.  If a virus is too small, a larger organism might be used to do the job.  Even nanobots could use the technology of the virus to spread themselves around.  When the winds of change are ablowin', who knows what they will carry?</p></td>
