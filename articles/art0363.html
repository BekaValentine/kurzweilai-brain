<p>Originally published December 3, 2001 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613235419/http://www.darwinmag.com/read/120101/hal_sidebar2.html" target="_new">darwinmag.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net December 3, 2001.</p>
<p>Darwin: Will robots ever become conscious?</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>: We have a basic assumption that other people are conscious, regardless of whether their subjective experiences are the same as our own. That's an assumption and people think it's only something that a philosopher would worry about. But it's actually a really practical question when we get outside this shared assumption of human beings being conscious. Because when we go outside this assumption, the consensus breaks down. Take animals, for example. There is not a consensus on whether or not animals are conscious. Some people feel that at least higher order animals are conscious, other people say, "No, you can't be conscious unless you have a mastery of human <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>; animals just operate by <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a> is a machinelike automatic response, so these animals just operate like machines."</p>
<p>If you go on to <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities, such as robots, there are more vexing questions. On the one hand, robots are more dissimilar to us than animals are because they're <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>. On the other hand, I'd predict that robotic entities we may meet 30 years from now will be displaying more humanlike behaviors than animals do because they'll be very explicitly patterned or modeled on human behavior. By that time, we will have completely reverse engineered the human brain; we'll be able to understand how it works, and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> robots accordingly.</p>
<p>I'm not saying all <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) will be humanlike. Some will be created without human personalities because they'll have specific jobs to do where they won't require human characteristics. But some will have human personalities because we'll want to interact with them in a humanlike way, through human <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. And in order to understand human <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, you need to understand human <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>--you have to be pretty human in order to understand human <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>.</p>
<p>So some of these machines will be humanlike, more humanlike than animals. They will be copies of humans, they will be making humanlike statements, and they'll be very convincing. Ultimately, they'll convince people that they are conscious.</p>
<p>Darwin: Won't people have a hard time accepting the notion that a robot is conscious?</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>: I get e-mails all the time that say, "But Ray, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, it's just a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, and even if it's a complicated <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, and if it surprises you sometimes, there's really nobody home, it's not aware of its <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>." And that seems like a pretty reasonable statement with regard to computers today, because computers today are still a million times simpler than the human brain, and they're constructed very, very differently.</p>
<p>But that's not an accurate description of machines 30 years from now. They will have the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the human brain and the organization and design of the brain. They'll claim to be conscious and have feelings--to be happy, angry, sad, whatever--and they'll have the subtle cues that we associate with those claims.</p>
<p>True, today you can make a virtual character in a game that claims to be happy. But the character is not very convincing. So you might go along with the fantasy for a while, but you don't really believe that this virtual character is having an emotional <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>; the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and depth of its <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> is not on a human level. Thirty years from now, that won't be the case. Machines will have the subtlety, <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, richness and depth of human behavior.</p>
<p>Darwin: How would we ever prove that a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is--or isn't--conscious?</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>: It's not a scientifically resolvable question, in my view. You can't build any sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> detection <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that doesn't have some philosophical assumptions built in to it. But my idea that machines will convince us they are conscious is not an ultimate philosophical, scientific statement. It's more of a political prediction. These machines will be intelligent and persuasive enough that we'll believe them. If we don't, they'll get mad at us, and we don't want them to get mad at us. But that's not philosophical proof that they're conscious. Ultimately, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is a first person phenomena. Beyond that, I'm just making assumptions. But that assumption is going to be tested as we create entities that are humanlike. It's also going to be tested by another phenomena, which is redefining human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> itself.</p>
<p>How is human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> going to change?</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> are going to become intertwined. There are quite a few human beings that already have computers in their brains, and it doesn't upset us too much because they're doing very narrow things today, like the Parkinson's implant that reduces tremors, and cochlear implants for deaf people. I envision a scenario where we'll be able to send billions of nanobots, which are tiny robots the size of blood cells, into the human brain, where they can communicate wirelessly with our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> neurons. Rather than an implant that's located in one position, these nanobots could be highly distributed, communicating with the brain in millions of places, and therefore become part of the brain. So when you deal with a human in 2035 or 2040, you'll be dealing with an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that has a very complicated <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brain, intimately integrated with <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> processes that will be equally complex and ultimately more complex. It's not going to be computers on the left side of the room, humans on the right; it's going to be a very intimate integration. By 2040, 2050, even <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> people will be mostly <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>. That clearly raises the spiritual issue of what is a person.</p>
<p>So you think <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will dominate human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?</p>
<p>Yes--the crossover point is somewhere in the 2030s, certainly by 2040 or 2050. One of the reasons that a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can ultimately be superior to human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is that it will combine the powers of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with certain <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> advantages. Computers today can already do some things better than human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can. A thousand dollar <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> can remember billions of things fairly accurately; we're hard pressed to remember a handful of phone numbers. Computers are inherently much faster. The electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing in the brain is literally 100 times slower than electric circuits today. Most important, machines can share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. If you want some capability on your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, you can just load the evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> of one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> onto it. Not so with humans. If I read <i>War and Peace</i> or learn French, I can't <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> that to you. Humans have an advantage today, in that our <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> is much more profound than what machines can do. But machines will be able to encompass all the skills of humans, and combine that with these other advantages I mentioned--being able to think faster, having very large, accurate memories. And they'll keep growing in their capability, doubling every year.</p>
<p>Darwin: Are these <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-induced changes you predict a threat to human <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> as we know it?</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>: In my mind, this is very much a part of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. This is very much a human endeavor. This is not an invasion of machines coming from outer space and taking us over. These machines are emerging from within our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. We're already very close to them; they're very intimately integrated into our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. If all the computers in the world stopped today our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>That wasn't true very recently. Thirty years ago, if all the computers in the world stopped, hardly anyone would notice except a few <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> scientists, maybe <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">IT</a> professionals. Certainly, 40 years ago, nobody was using them. We're now very dependent on our computers. We no longer have our hand on the <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>, so to speak, because our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is so dependent on the machines, and bit by bit the machines are getting more and more intelligent.</p>

<br>
<br>
Synthetic neural modeling 
<br>
<br>
The unique multilevel aspect of brain function requires a new approach to neural modeling. Pioneered by researchers at the Institute, synthetic neural modeling represents such a multilevel theoretical approach to the problem of understanding the neuronal bases of adaptive behavior. It uses simultaneous large-scale computer simulations of the nervous system, the phenotype, and the environment of a particular organism to study events and their interactions at these three levels. The simulations are based on physiological and anatomical data. They incorporate detailed models for synaptic modification and for the organization of cells into neuronal groups and layers and brain regions to generate behavior in the context of a particular environment and the unique history of an organism. Synthetic neural modeling takes into account possible evolutionary origins and modes of development of the nervous system, permitting a wide range of psychophysical and behavioral phenomena to be studied within a common framework.
<br>
<br>
A series of neurally basedmulti-jointeds been developed at the Institute. One such automaton, Darwin III, exists in an environment of simple neurally shapes moving on a background; its phenotype comprises a sessile "creature" with an eye and a multijointed arm provided with senses of touch and kinesthesia; its nervous system consists of some 50 interconnected networks containing over 50,000 cells and 620,000 synaptic junctions. By interaction with its environment, Darwin III develops sensorimotor coordination, permitting it to track moving objects with its eye, to reach out and touch objects with its arm, to categorize certain objects according to combinations of visual, tactile and kinesthetic cues, and to respond to objects based on previous categorizations. These elementary behaviors provide a microcosm in which it is possible to analyze critical problems involving the acquisition and maturation of integrated sensory and motor behavior in animals.

He used to have a lot of fun chasing the red dot from a laser pointer around on the floor in the house or even outside in the grass at night. A few months ago Butch had a definite epiphany. He, all of a sudden, stopped chasing the dot and looked at the pointer in my hand. He pounced on the dot a couple of times and returned to looking at the pointer. There was more than just dumb animal going on in Butch's head. His actions were not instinctive or mechanical. Even now, when we play with the pointer, Butch will chase the dot around for only a few seconds before looking at the pointer or me. As we continue to play, if he looses where the dot is or if I stop pushing the button switch, Butch will look at me with a definite expression and tilt of the head as if to say, 'Hey! C'mon!' Sometimes he will be crouched down with his rear end up and head turned such that he may see both the floor and me.
<br>
     Anyone who has ever had a non-human friend will surely agree that there are actions and true expressions on these animals which definitely show something is 'going on in there.'

2.     I could write a book on why I dislike the term 'artificial intelligence.' An expert system (don't ya just love that one?) is artificial intelligence. Are you (collective) familiar with the computer program (old verbal game) 'Is it a turtle?' That could be construed as artificial intelligence. Intelligence CAN NOT be programmed!!!!!  I don't want to go too deep into an explanation as I am working on an intelligence allegory. Suffice it to say intelligence forms as data input is digested then analyzed on multiple levels. If an awareness of causality occurs the spark of intelligence will ignite. A dog, which sits after being told to do so, is conscious by definition. A squirrel figuring how to get seed from a bird feeder is self-conscious by definition. Only by matter of degree can intelligence and consciousness be judged. One could argue that a plant is intelligent and conscious in that it 'knows' it needs sunlight and then consciously bends toward that light. Most humans are simply insecure and try to define themselves as the only life form which does 'this' or 'that.' The identifying aspects of humanity I find are not all characteristics for which to be proud.

Even the simplest computers ARE 'complex' in the sense that they are in a myriad of physical states, consisting of atoms as they do. There is no difference to the non-knowledgable observerver in fact wether the computers' enginneruing aggregate-design level 'memmory and chip' combination is 'running a program' any more than the atoms it consists of doing the same.

The complexity argument assumes the absolute existence of structural 'awareness' ( by the universe ) and some sort of quasi-religious concept enabling the computer designer to convey this concept of 'complexity' into the universe which then responds by generating a mental-physical phenmena in the form of consciousness.

This is less tenable than the squawkings of the average bible-basher - no matter how many different and interesting ways you manipulate 1s and 0s ( or any other derived mathematical onbect mapped from a physical observable ) you will never , ever generate anything other than other mathematical objects from it.</p></td>

Os and 1s are mathematical objects that could be mapped to certain physical attributes of the DNA , but the fact that the chemical operation of DNA has a mathematical analogue does not make the analogue the principal cause of DNA reproduction - that is due to the chemical/physical nature of DNA - is a painting of a duck the same thing as a duck ?

Just and "on" and "off" are used in a computer to stand for 1 and 0.  Ther are no 1s and 0s in a computer, either.  1 and 0 are used to symbolize a relationship that is carried out in some other medium.  
<br>
<br>
In DNA, there are two types of steps on the ladder of information a cell uses to make another cell: one is Adenine, which is always tied to thymine; the other is cytosine, which is always tied to guanine.  So you can look at AT as one unit of information and CG as another.  If we wish, we can call AT a 1 and CG a 2.  This is no more arbitrary than calling a switch that is turned on a 1 and a switch that is turned off a 0.  
<br>
<br>
Of course, for the DNA you have to add a symbol, such as a + or - to show the orientation of the TA or GC because the computer that is reading and interpreting the code is sensitive to that aspect.  You might compare it to typed input that is case sensitive and reads "a" as a different symbol than "A.".  But in both cases you are using what amounts to a binary tape being processed one step at a time to carry out a program.  </p></td>

Tnis 'structure' ( an onject of the same type as a mathematical object I assume) you attribute with phenomenologocal qualities that can lead to the rise of intelligence, consciousness and other mental phenomena.
<br>
<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is that your information model of DNA is inherent in your UNDERSTANDING of DNA. Sure, DNA is a phenomenal molecule that appears to be a unique life signature : it lends itself to 'information' modelling I suppose. As a model its as useful as any other explicative device but I presume has to get very ad-hoc when accounting for mutation,inadequate nutrition and the like. In short , I think an 'information model' of cell reproduction adds nothing to the currently pefectly adequate and considerably more accurate straightforaward chemical/biological descriptions.
<br>
<br>
What I would strongly contend with, however, is that the reproduction of 'structural entities' LEADS to phenomena - this is no different to saying that there is no differnce between a duck and a painting of a duck. That is total nonsense.</p></td>
