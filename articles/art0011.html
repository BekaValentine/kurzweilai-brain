<div class="TeaserText">Many people, including many scientists, mistakenly believe that human progress, in the form it has taken in the last few hundred years, is unsustainable," says Stanford University Professor of Computer Science Dr. John McCarthy. In this article, he presents the scientific case for technological optimism.</div>

<br><p>Originally published February 4, 1995 as an academic paper, Stanford University, in a longer <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011093422/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/" target="_new">version</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>Humanity has <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed over hundreds of thousands of years, but until about the seventeenth century, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> was a rare <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. There were novelties but a person would not expect a whole sequence of improvements in his lifetime. Since then scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> has been continual, and in the advanced parts of the world, there has also been continued technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. Therefore, people no longer expect the world to remain the same as it is.</p>
<p> [Very likely, the greatest rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> for the average person occurred around the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century when telephones, automobiles, electric lighting, and home refrigeration came in short <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>.]</p>
<p>We argue that the whole world can reach and maintain American standards of living with a population of even 15 billion. We also argue that maintaining material <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is the highest priority and the best way to ensure that population eventually stabilizes at a sustainable level with a standard of living above the present American level and continues to improve thereafter.</p>
<p>These opinions are old-fashioned according to some people, but they have a lot of support. For example, the biologist E. O. Wilson writes in his excellent book <a class="thought" href="entries/consilience_entry.html">Consilience</a>:</p>
<blockquote> "In contrast to widespread opinion, I believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a> thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries got it mostly right. The assumptions they made about a lawful material world, the intrinsic unity of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and the potential for indefinite <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> are the ones we still take most readily to heart, suffer without, and find maximally rewarding as we learn more and more about the circumstances of our lives."</blockquote>
<p>I offer no opinion about a "right" population, and I suspect that population will eventually be limited by a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of crowdedness rather than by material considerations.</p>
<p>There is a widespread belief that the present standard of living of the advanced countries is not sustainable and not extendable to the present backward countries. I and many others don't agree. This exposition mainly concerns scientific and technological bases for <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> rather than the historical and economic arguments ably advanced by the late Julian Simon.</p>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about sustainability of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.</p>
<p>Q. What is meant by material <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the last few centuries has included the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to material goods.</li>
<li>Increased <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span.</li>
<li>Reduced childhood <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>.</li>
<li>Increased opportunities for <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>.</li>
<li>Societies that people choose to migrate to.</li>
<li>More individual choice of occupation, lifestyle and avocations.</li>
<li>More opportunity to enjoy both culture and <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</li>
<li>Cleaner environment.</li>
<li>Increased consideration for the values in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, e.g. for the preservation of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>.</li>
<li>Increased concern for less advanced people and their cultures.</li>
<li>More and more new goods and services available to more and more people. Available novelty is a good. Compulsory novelty is often a nuisance or worse.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> was a consequence of the advance of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and also of advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> and other social organizations in capitalist society. These other social organizations include universities, societies for the promotion of the arts, trade unions, publications, political parties, and advocacy organizations. Mainly it was <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which became increasingly based on scientific discoveries.</p>
<p>None of these advances ensure that everyone will be happy. The American Declaration of Independence wisely offers only the pursuit of happiness. However, I believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> has resulted in less acute unhappiness. Someone who thinks otherwise should explain how parents were just as happy when half of their children died in childhood.</p>
<p>All these things are dependent on the material wealth of society. People can dispute about how to divide the wealth, but there has to be wealth to divide. Here are some of the questions that have led some people believe this <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> can't continue and some answers to the worries.</p>
<p>Q. Can the world grow enough food for 15 billion people?</p>
<p>A. Yes, it can and with present agricultural <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. With better <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, probably a lot more. <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a> based on molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> is just beginning to be applied to agriculture.</p>
<p>Q. Aren't our forests being exhausted?</p>
<p>A. No. In the industrial countries, the land in forest is stable and the quantity of wood is increasing. In the tropical underdeveloped countries, there is still substantial conversion of forest to agriculture.</p>
<p>Q. Is humanity suffering from an enormous loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p>A. The loss is quite small of the important or individually interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s and birds. However, beetle <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in the Amazon may be disappearing.</p>
<p>Q. Isn't the world running out of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>.</p>
<p>A. No. Nuclear and solar&gt; <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> are each adequate for the next several billion years. That's right; billion not just million or thousand.</p>
<p>Q. Isn't it important to conserve <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>?</p>
<p>A. <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> needs to be regarded as just another commodity, to be used in whatever quantity is cost-effective. It is available in whatever amounts may be needed. Treating its conservation as a special goal has been wasteful of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> effort. We are the poorer for it.</p>
<p>Q. When will we run out of oil?</p>
<p>A. Twenty years ago, I had been convinced that by the end of this century we would be out of oil directly pumpable from the ground. Obviously, we won't, and I am cautious about how much oil there is left. Maybe 20 years, maybe 50 years, maybe 100 years, but I can't see it lasting longer than 100 years.</p>
<p>However, oil can be extracted from oil shale, from tar sands (as it is in Alberta, Canada) and synthesized from coal. These processes(except for tar sands) are too expensive to compete with just letting it just flow out of the ground in Saudi Arabia, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was developed when it was <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> oil would run out soon. The costs would be affordable. Taking these sources into account we probably have several hundred years supply of oil, provided "greenhouse" warming permits its use.</p>
<p>Q. What will happen when all these sources run out or if <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> requires severe restrictions?</p>
<p>A. Oil and natural gas are readily replaced by nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> for heating and electricity generation. However, oil is not so readily replaced for transportation. If we can develop good enough batteries, electric cars are a solution. If not, liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> will work for cars and trucks.</p>
<p>Q. What about the non-fuel uses of oil and natural gas? Don't our plastics depend on their availability?</p>
<p>A. Oil and gas are used as feedstocks for making plastics of all kinds, but the amounts are much smaller than their use for fuel. Any source of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> will do in place of oil and gas - coal or biomass, for example. Oil and gas are used today, because they are cheap, easy to handle and carry the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required for the chemical reactions along with the materials.</p>
<p>Q. Will we run out of minerals?</p>
<p>A. No. There is plenty of every <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> in major use. It is a question of the economic concepts of reserves and resources. Iron ore and aluminum ore are presently obtained from very rich ores available in a few places in the world. These ores can be shipped long distances by water at small cost. They are oxides rather than the silicates which present refining procedures don't handle. The <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>'s crust is 5 percent iron and 7 percent aluminum, but most of it as silicates. Refining silicates will require more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. However, the extractive industries only account for four percent of the American <a class="thought" href="entries/gdp_entry.html">GDP</a>, so we can afford more expensive extraction processes when they become necessary.</p>
<p>Indeed once we can extract minerals from random rock, the only way of running out of an <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> is to eject it from the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> or to let it subduct under a continent. This is because using quantities of <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s doesn't destroy them. Therefore, the scrap piles will eventually be ores. This won't happen for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, because more concentrated ores will remain available for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>In fact metal ores have become more inexpensive recently as is illustrated by the famous bet between the Stanford environmentalist Paul Ehrlich and the economist Julian Simon. In 1980 Simon sold Ehrlich (on credit) ten year <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s on five metals of Ehrlich's choosing. The total price was $1,000. In 1990 Ehrlich had to pay Simon $600, because the metals had gone down in price.</p>
<p>Q. Doesn't the second law of thermodynamics tell us that the lower the concentration of the ore, the more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> it takes to extract it?</p>
<p>A. It does indeed, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required goes up very slowly as the concentration goes down. To separate one mole of a substance from n moles of a <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> requires an <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> RT ln n according to the second law. According to this formula, it would pay to extract one <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> of uranium from the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. Of course, mineral extraction is more expensive than that, but the second law of thermodynamics isn't the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>.</p>
<p>Q. What if the population increases?</p>
<p>A. There is certainly a limit to the population the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> can support, and migration into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> can only occur very slowly at the present level of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The limiting factor may be food, but a feeling that enough is enough may be more important. We will see what happens when 10,000 people try to post to a usenet newsgroup. That won't require any increase in population - only an increase in the availability of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Nevertheless, it will give everyone a taste of a more crowded world. Some people ascribe the increased crowdedness of American national parks to the increase in population. However the number of visitors to Yosemite National increased 2.6 times as fast as the population of the U.S. or of California. The crowdedness is caused by increased equality of opportunity to visit the parks.</p>
<p>Q. How fast is population increasing?</p>
<p>A. In the U.S., Europe, and Japan, the birth rate is below the level required to sustain the population. The population is increasing because of immigration and from the baby boom that followed WWII. It is the grandchildren of the boomers that are keeping the schools going.</p>
<p>In much of the rest of the world the population is still increasing, but the rate of increase is slowing, especially in the big countries of China, India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>There is still a high rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in Africa south of the Sahara, but it also shows signs of slowing.</p>
<p>Q. Is the population problem urgent?</p>
<p>A. Only in a few countries, and it is their problem, because they have sovereignty. People in the advanced countries can only provide <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but adequate birth control <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has already been provided. For the world as a whole, the population problem may be important, but it is not urgent.</p>
<p>Q. Isn't the world running out of usable fresh water supplies.</p>
<p>A. No, but some countries may have to spend a lot of money on water projects, just as our ancestors did.</p>
<p>Q. What about the ozone layer, the ozone hole and UV-B?</p>
<p>A. On the theory that chlorofluorocarbons put chlorine in the upper atmosphere which destroys ozone, their manufacture has been banned. A 90 percent <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> would have been just as effective and less economically disruptive, but industry seems to be adjusting to the total ban.</p>
<p>Q. Won't <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> do us in unless we drastically reduce our use of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>?</p>
<p>A. No. <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">Global warming</a> can be avoided or reversed should it turn out to be a serious problem. However, there is a thorough paper "Why <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">Global Warming</a> Would be Good for You" by Tom Moore of the Hoover Institution.</p>
<p>Q. What about trash and garbage? Aren't we likely to drown in them?</p>
<p>A. The U.S. produces about 375 million tons of trash and garbage per year. There is no real shortage of land where it can be put. It should be piled quite high. What changed is that before the recent enthusiasm for wetlands, filling in swamps with garbage was the approved thing to do, and the land was available without cost. Now it must be paid for, but the costs are quite bearable.</p>
<p>Q. Given all this uncertainty about the prospects for continuing material <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, isn't it better to be safe than sorry?</p>
<p>A. Yes, but material <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is much more likely to be safe than is stagnation. The proposals for limiting <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> are likely to cost lives from poverty and make humanity less capable of dealing with dealing with the inevitable emergencies.</p>
<p>The proposals claiming that safety lies in restraining <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> are more likely to lead to sorrow than continuing <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in general.</p>
<p>Q. Have environmental and health and safety regulations been expensive to our society?</p>
<p>A. Yes, they have cost about $625 billion per year according to one estimate. [Other estimates are different.] My opinion is that many of the regulations have been worthwhile, but a great many (probably most) have contributed very little when compared to the costs they have imposed on individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>However, our society can survive even a large amount of irrational regulation. I remain an extreme optimist--one who believes the would will probably survive even if it doesn't take his advice.</p>
<p>Q. Aren't the people of the advanced countries using more than their proper share of natural resources?</p>
<p>A. People can really be said to use more than their share of something if their use deprives someone else of it. If there is plenty for everyone for the indefinite <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, the concept of fair share is meaningless.</p>
<p>The only major commodity whose use in the advanced countries may deprive people of the poor countries in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is petroleum. How near is the exhaustion of petroleum is not clear.</p>
<p>When the petroleum supply shows clear signs of running out, perhaps the advanced countries should give the poor countries some extra help in making the transition to nuclear and possibly solar <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> petroleum runs out some, maybe even most, of the presently poor countries will no longer be too poor to solve their own <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> problems. Any country, which like the U.S. today, spends only 8 percent of its <a class="thought" href="entries/gdp_entry.html">GDP</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> can afford to solve its own <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> problems.</p>
<p>Q. What does it <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> whether we believe <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is sustainable or not?</p>
<p>A. Important policies depend on it.</p>
<ol>
<li>If <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> were not sustainable, then it would be important to reduce consumption of whatever resources were limiting <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. It would be the particular duty of the countries using the most of these resources.</li>
<li>Since <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is sustainable, and there is no limiting resource in the short term (next few hundred years and probably much longer), the most important way to help the poor countries is to help them develop more or less along the path pioneered by the richer countries--skipping some steps when possible.</li>
<li>The richer countries should continue their <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, both for the sake of their own citizens and because the richer the country is, the more it is likely to do to help others.</li>
</ol>

the bitterness created to sustain material progress is far more than the happiness it can bring.
<br>
<br>
We have better conditions. This is true however, keeping that way better requires continual improvement of the production technics togethe with increased productivtiy and efficacy. Being more productive means that human will be acting more predictably, more controlled. 
<br>
<br>
I agree that there is no close danger of exhaustion of resources, but sustaining material growth require more tension everyday. The human kind is more becomming like a working unit . 
<br>
<br>
People are not happier because sustainig this is becoming more difficult yes it is possible but more and more pain.
<br>
<br>
I believe we should treat the whole concept of science in a diiferent way. The scientific movement should be diverted so that priorities will change. simply from profit maximization to to a more sensible and responsible attitude.
<br>
<br>
Technological improvement is fascinating but is of little help for over all peace of the humankind. The growth is driven by consumption this what shoyld be changed.</p></td>

Ok, John. I volunteer. Parents were just as happy because that was their reality and they had to make do with it. It was what they were born into. It was just as likely that neighbor's lost half their offspring as well.
<br>
<br>
Technology is good, and I don't argue that lower child fatality rates are better, but that argument is confounded. In some cases, unhappiness is created when one realizes that something can be done and isn't being done, and happiness results when it is done. Back then, no one knew that anything could be done. "Less acute unhappiness?" I don't know how more weakly polemic you want to sound. Why is it only acute? Because if it wasn't, it would immediately appear false.</p></td>

<br>
The Russian government considers the long-term program on the domestic mineral wealth
<br>
<br>
Russia's gold and oil economic efficiency will be exhausted in 2011, Yury Trutnev, the Minister for Natural Resources stated at a recent session of the Russian government. The minister noted that the time when the reserves of certain kinds of mineral wealth would be exhausted in Russia was drawing near. Trutnev specified that the resources of crude, uranium, copper and gold would end in the country already in 2015.
<br>
<br>
"These terms do not raise big concerns at first sight. Yet, in the event the reproduction of mineral resources pauses due to peculiarities of geological preparations for deposits, it will be impossible to solve the problem of the mineral wealth deficit in Russia," the minister said.
