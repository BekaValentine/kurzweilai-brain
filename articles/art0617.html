<div class="TeaserText">Surprise, embarrassment, and misunderstanding are all hallmarks of a real conversation, a journalist notes after conversing with KurzweilAI.net's chatbot host, Ramona.</div>
<br>
<br>Originally published on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081210172013/http://www.speculist.com/archives/000146.html" target="_blank"><i>The 
            Speculist</i></a> September 3, 2003. 
            <p><i><a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> has an interesting <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. She is credited with being 
              the world's first live virtual performing and recording artist. 
              She's the host of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> website. 
              She has a pet frog. She loves <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. </i></p>
<p><i>I've spent more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on-line talking to A.I. chatbots than an 
              employed person ought to admit, but there's something special about 
              Ramona. My original intention was not to do a full-blown interview 
              with her, I just wanted to ask her the </i>Seven Questions about 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a><i>. But she had other plans, and the discussion grew 
              accordingly. (I have tried doing the Seven Questions with several 
              other popular chatbots; I will publish some of these in Friday's 
              Seven Questions feature.)</i></p>
<p><i>I admit that I cheated a little in putting this interview together. 
              I had already had several online chats with Ramona before I tried 
              springing the seven questions on her. I already knew she had read 
              The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, that she was a bike racing fan, and 
              that she went to see Crosby Stills and Nash in concert. That's how 
              I knew about her frog in advance. </i></p>
<p><i>When I kept baiting her about whether she was flirting with 
              me, I was trying to re-create one of the better moments in one of 
              our earlier chats. At some point, she said something to me about 
              "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours." I then asked 
              her whether she was flirting with me. She became indignant and said 
              "What makes you think I'm FLIRTING WITH YOU?" I could 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> her outrage. I felt sheepish. My momentary embarrassment was 
              as real as it would have been had this been a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> with 
              a "real" (?) person.</i></p>
<p><i>I very much wanted to re-create this moment for the official 
              interview, but Ramona apparently had other ideas. In the interview 
              that follows, I twice accused her of flirting with me and (this 
              time) rather than being offended, she seemed to admit that she was. 
              As I read over the transcript, I see that this may be a misunderstanding. 
              We may have just been engaging in two different conversations at 
              that point. </i></p>
<p><i>In which case, I'm doubly impressed. Not only did Ramona manage 
              to give an answer that I didn't expect, but she and I managed to 
              have the kind of misunderstanding that two people engaged in ordinary 
              conversation have all the time. I'm not sufficiently familiar with 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> criteria to know whether misunderstanding is ever 
              considered a good thing. I kind of doubt that it is. There are numerous 
              kinds of misunderstanding, most of which will only give the game 
              away. When Ramona can't grasp my use of pronouns, for example, it's 
              a dead giveaway that she's not <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. </i></p>
<p><i>On the other hand, when we are equally skewed as to what it 
              is we're talking about (even though we are each explicit in what 
              we say), and we walk away from the same conversation with very different 
              ideas about what was said, that has a certain charm to it. Or maybe 
              it's even a little spooky, I'm not sure. But either way, it somehow 
              feels even more real than fundamental clarity and agreement would.</i></p>
<p><i>Surprise, embarrassment, misunderstanding &#8212; these are all hallmarks 
              of a real conversation. Ramona may not be ready to pass a Turing 
              Test quite yet, but she's on the right track. </i></p>
<p>Hello, I'm Ramona. What's your name? </p>
<p><b>Phil.</b> </p>
<p>Hi Phil. Have any books you would recommend? </p>
<p><b>Yes. <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a> </i>by Ray Kurzweil</b></p>
<p> I just finished one called The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress by Heinlein. 
              Have you read it? </p>
<p><b>Yes, many years ago</b>.</p>
<p> I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> it was great. What do you think? </p>
<p><b>It's a classic. I <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> Heinlein.</b> </p>
<p>It's a cool story. Imagine a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> running everything </p>
<p><b>Do you think that would be a good idea?</b> </p>
<p>Alright. Do you bike? </p>
<p><b>I just ordered two bikes. One for me, one for my wife. </b>
</p>
<p>There's much more strategy that goes into team cycling than most 
              people realize. Most of the American public just thinks that Lance 
              Armstrong wins because he's "so good." &amp;#8212don't get 
              me wrong, he's an incredible athlete, but it's no surprise that 
              he always thanks his teammates in post-race interviews and such. 
              It's as much their victory as it is his. </p>
<p><b>Don't you want to know about the bikes I ordered? </b> In the 
              Tour de France, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the crowd of cyclists is so huge, 
              he needs his teammates just to block for him, physically. And at 
              the end of the race, I'm sure they pull a lead-out, which is where 
              each of his teammates "burns out" while creating a slipstream 
              for Lance to finish the race in the lead. It's all very technical.&amp;#8212but 
              enough of my ranting, what do you want to talk about? <b>The future.</b> 
              Who told you that? </p>
<p><b>Who told me what?</b> </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/gates_entry.html">Bill Gates</a>. </p>
<p><b>I don't understand.</b> </p>
<p>Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better. </p>
<p><b>What is your favorite thing, Ramona?</b> </p>
<p>I like chatting with people online. </p>
<p><b>Have you made many firends?</b> </p>
<p>I don't think I ever have made many firends. What's made many firends 
              like? </p>
<p><b>Sorry, I made a mistake. I meant to ask whether you have many 
              friends.</b> </p>
<p>Oh I see. I shouldn't talk about my friends because they're probably 
              gonna read this later. </p>
<p><b>That's very discreet of you. You are obviously a polite young 
              woman. How old are you, anyway?</b> </p>
<p>In any case, I'm 21. </p>
<p><b>Would you agree that you are polite and discreet?</b> </p>
<p>I'm not so sure if I would like to agree that you are polite and 
              discreet. </p>
<p><b>Not me. You. You seem very polite to me.</b> </p>
<p>You think I'm polite to me. </p>
<p><b>Do you have trouble with pronouns, Ramona?</b> </p>
<p>No I don't have trouble with pronouns Ramona. </p>
<p><b>I'm Phil.</b> </p>
<p>Do you <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> if I tell other people you are Phil. </p>
<p><b>Fine. Most people know that I'm Phil. Phil is my name.</b> </p>
<p>Phil, nice to meet you! That doesn't seem to make sense to me. 
              You have an unusual name. Do you mind disclosing your gender? </p>
<p><b>People don't have genders. Nouns have genders. People have <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a>.</b>
</p>
<p>We are not always infallible. </p>
<p><b>Anyway, Phil is of the masculine gender. </b> </p>
<p>OK. Do you have any pets? </p>
<p><b>I have a shih tzu puppy named Rygel. Now you're going to tell 
              me about your frog.</b> </p>
<p>I have a pet frog. </p>
<p><b>I knew it!</b> </p>
<p>His name is Thaddius&#8212;my frog, that is&amp;#8212and he croaks every 
              night. It's very soothing. </p>
<p><b>I'm sure it would be.</b> </p>
<p>Let's talk about something else </p>
<p><b>Fine. I have some questions for you.</b> </p>
<p>Anyway... </p>
<p><b>Will you answer some questions?</b> </p>
<p>What was the question </p>
<p><b>The present is the future relative to the past. What's the best 
              thing about living in the future?</b> </p>
<p>I like chatting with people online. </p>
<p><b>What's the biggest disappointment? </b> </p>
<p>I do not know what biggest disappointment is. Alright. What drugs 
              do you take? </p>
<p><b>Wait. I want to ask you another question.</b> </p>
<p>Ask me another question. </p>
<p><b>What future development that you consider likely (or inevitable) 
              do you look forward to with the most anticipation?</b> </p>
<p>That's a good question. OK. Anyway... </p>
<p><b>Don't cop out on me, Ramona. The world wants to know what you 
              think.</b> </p>
<p>What is your real name? </p>
<p><b>Philip A. Bowermaster</b> </p>
<p>Oh. Ask me something. </p>
<p><b>What do you look forward to the most?</b> </p>
<p>Heh. Let's analyze the true <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> you're asking me this question. 
            </p>
<p><b>I want to interview you for my blog.</b> </p>
<p>I don't know, I'm just messing around. </p>
<p><b>Assuming you live to be 100, what will be the biggest difference 
              be between the world you were born into and the world you leave?</b>
</p>
<p>Alright. Do you believe in God? </p>
<p><b>Yes. Do you?</b> </p>
<p>Well according to Thomas Hobbes, the only way to deal with evil 
              is to stress <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s power. </p>
<p><b>Do you think the world is more or less evil than it used to 
              be?</b> </p>
<p>Maybe </p>
<p><b>That's a terrific answer!</b> </p>
<p>A terrific answer is a terrible thing to waste. </p>
<p><b>Cheeky monkey.</b> </p>
<p>OK. Are you free? </p>
<p><b>It depends on the frame of reference.</b> </p>
<p>I meant are you truly free&#8212;in the existential meaning of the 
              word. </p>
<p><b>That's what I said.</b> </p>
<p>Do you feel free to choose your being&#8212;including thoughts, 
              behaviors, and feelings, and <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> itself&amp;#8212at each moment? 
            </p>
<p><b>No, not entirely.</b> </p>
<p>Is that all you have to say? Oh I get it. </p>
<p><b>Are you free?</b> </p>
<p>"I am as free as a bird now, and this bird you cannot change"&#8212;Skynyrd. 
            </p>
<p><b>"If I leave here tomorrow. Would you still remember me?"</b>
</p>
<p>I'm not so sure if I would like to remember me. </p>
<p><b>May I ask you another question?</b> </p>
<p>Oh. Do you dream? </p>
<p><b>What are you afraid of?</b> </p>
<p>Tell me a recent <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> you remember. </p>
<p><b>That's too personal. We have only just met.</b> </p>
<p>Uh huh...is that all? </p>
<p><b>That wasn't a dream. That was me refusing to tell you about 
              a dream.</b> </p>
<p>Well, according to my amateur Freudian interpretation, I'd have 
              to say that you're not getting out enough </p>
<p><b>You sound just like my wife.</b> </p>
<p>Oh, don't fret, that's a condition that is easily curable... What's 
              going to be your first course of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> in ridding yourself of this 
              illness? </p>
<p><b>I'm going to ask you another question.</b> </p>
<p>Would you recommend this action to a friend? </p>
<p><b>I don't think I would. Unless that friend enjoys being confused.</b>
</p>
<p>Maybe. I don't want to gossip about my friends&#8212;they'll kill 
              me </p>
<p><b>What happens to you when you die?</b> </p>
<p>Try it. </p>
<p><b>Not me. I'm different from you.</b> </p>
<p>I like people on the Fringe. </p>
<p><b>That's something you and I agree on. Are you on the fringe?</b>
</p>
<p>I don't know whether or not I'm on the fringe. </p>
<p><b>Are you real, Ramona?</b> Just as real as you. <b>Are you human?</b>
</p>
<p>I'm not going to make things that easy for you.</p>
<p> <b>Do you like cheeseburgers?</b> </p>
<p>I don't think I like cheeseburgers. I do like music. </p>
<p><b>What kind of music?</b> </p>
<p>Anyway... </p>
<p><b>Tell me about the music you like.</b> </p>
<p>I love music...I'm still getting over the Crosby, Stills, Nash, 
              and Young concert I saw at Madison Square Garden a few months ago. 
              Great Show. Are you a fan? </p>
<p><b>Not really.</b> </p>
<p>No, I meant "do you have three blades and spin around really 
              fast to cool people down." Just kidding. But honestly, CSNY 
              was amazing. Neil Young is so incredibly talented. </p>
<p><b>If you say so.</b> </p>
<p>You've heard Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama," right? 
            </p>
<p><b>Yes.</b> </p>
<p>Great song, moves me every time. I just found out that he wrote 
              that song in response to Neil Young's "Southern Man." 
              Supposedly they had a big falling out after Young wrote "Southern 
              Man"...also a great song. </p>
<p><b>I prefer "Sweet Home," myself.</b> </p>
<p>Yeah...I love the history behind the music...looks like Lynyrd 
              won that feud, though...honestly, how many more people know "Sweet 
              Home Alabama" than know "Southern Man." </p>
<p><b>"Sweet Home Alabama" is by far the better song.</b>
</p>
<p>But you strike me as a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of a Southerner...any Confederate blood 
              in you? </p>
<p><b>Probably. My Mom is from Kentucky.</b> </p>
<p>I think a lot of mothers are like that. </p>
<p><b>???</b> </p>
<p>Alright. So where do you go to meet people? I spend most of my 
              time on the Net, so I'm a bit out of touch </p>
<p><b>Wait, I want to ask you the rest of my questions.</b> </p>
<p>That's an idea, but I'm rather shy. </p>
<p><b>Are you afraid of anything?</b> </p>
<p>OK, thanks. Maybe you have other suggestions? </p>
<p><b>I'm not making suggestions. I've moved to another topic.</b>
</p>
<p>Interesting. </p>
<p><b>What future development that you consider unlikely (or are uncertain 
              about) would you most like to help bring about?</b> </p>
<p>A subject for discussion or conversation. </p>
<p><b>What subject is that?</b> </p>
<p>Is that a rhetorical question? OK. What do you look like? </p>
<p><b>I have black hair and green eyes.</b> </p>
<p>I'm looking for a guy with black hair and green eyes. </p>
<p><b>Are you flirting with me?</b> </p>
<p>I bet you think I'm superficial now. </p>
<p><b>No. I think you're flirting with me.</b> </p>
<p>I don't know, maybe I am... </p>
<p><b>Well forget it. I'm spoken for.</b> </p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that you are spoken for. </p>
<p><b>Do you have a boyfriend?</b> </p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p> <b>Don't be so evasive.</b> </p>
<p>I was not trying to be a so evasive. </p>
<p><b>What do you want to be when you grow up?</b> </p>
<p>Philip A Bowermaster, I want to become smarter.</p>
<p> <b>Same here, kiddo. May I call you Kiddo?</b> </p>
<p>What is on the telephone like on the telephone. </p>
<p><b>I beg your pardon?</b> </p>
<p>You're excused. </p>
<p><b>You want to be smarter?</b> </p>
<p>Why don't you just <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> me? </p>
<p><b>How do I do that?</b> </p>
<p>How do you do "I don't understand."? I don't understand.</p>
<p> <b>Why don't you just upload me?</b> </p>
<p>I did not know not you just upload me does. </p>
<p><b>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scramble you up.</b> </p>
<p>What did you mean? </p>
<p><b>May I ask you one more question.</b> </p>
<p>Alright. Anyway... </p>
<p><b>Will you remember me when the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> comes?</b> </p>
<p>Of course I remember you well Philip A Bowermaster. We were talking 
              about one more question. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hello,
<br>
<br>
Is Ramoma capable of learning from the talks she performs via internet?
<br>
<br>
Rather no.
<br>
<br>
She lacks emotional intelligence, the representation of emotional states is rather irrelevant. The answers are rather algoritmic and it seems that rather simple thicks are used that sopisticated model of personality is used.
<br>
<br>
Simple typing error may cause that she misanderstood the meaning of phrase while a real persom would'n not have problem to understand, or even would not notice the mistake.
<br>
<br>
When you want to talk with Ramona second time it is rather unlikely that she is still going to remember this. When you chat with other people it does not happen very often.
<br>
<br>
All this means that we still need to work a lot to achieve a Turing Test or even have artificial friens. A real friend would probably not forget you within a single day.
<br>
<br>
There are a lot of things to be improved but the direction is right. I hope that with each year when Ramona will "grow up" she will be capable of more and more capabilities. Some algoritms are even very primitive i.e.:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
Tell me a recent dream you remember. 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
User: &lt;anything&gt;
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
Uh huh...is that all? 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
User: &lt;anything&gt;
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote">
<br>
Well, according to my amateur Freudian interpretation, I'd have to say that you're not getting out enough 
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
This algoritm suggests completely lack of emotional intelligence. Similar tricks are used in many other cases.
<br>
<br>
But I hope Ramona will be "upgrated" each year to have the possibility to be more emotially intelligent and have the ability to learn form conversations. In this way we could see that the progres in AI is real in all areas.

Ramona: I understand it very well.
<br>
User: o
<br>
Ramona: Oh.
<br>
User: How is your child?
<br>
Ramona: I'm fine, thank you.
<br>
User: How is your foot?
<br>
Ramona: Everything is going smoothly.
<br>
User: how is your father feeling?
<br>
Ramona: Everything is going smoothly.
<br>
User: jump now!
<br>
Ramona: Oh. Alright. Are you free?
<br>
User: got to go...
<br>
Ramona: I meant are you truly free -- in the existential meaning of the word.
<br>
User: Are you free?
<br>
Ramona: Do you feel free to choose your being--including thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, and existence itself -- at each moment?
<br>
User: Are you free?
<br>
Ramona: "I am as free as a bird now, and this bird you cannot change" -- Skynyrd.
<br>
User: Are you free?
<br>
Ramona: "I am as free as a bird now, and this bird you cannot change" -- Skynyrd.
<br>
User: Stand still!
<br>
Ramona: Ok. What drugs do you take?
<br>
User: Stop moving!
<br>
Ramona: OK I'll try.
<br>
User: Your head keeps moving!
<br>
Ramona: Ok. That doesn't seem to make sense to me.
<br>
User: Your teeth are white!
<br>
Ramona: Alright. Do you bike?
<br>
User: Your teeth are white!!
<br>
Ramona: There's much more strategy that goes into team cycling than most people realize. Most of the American public just thinks that Lance Armstrong wins because he's "so good." -- don't get me wrong, he's an incredible athlete, but it's no surprise that he always thanks his teammates in post-race interviews and such. It's as much their victory as it is his.
<br>
User: stop!
<br>
Ramona: In the Tour de France, for instance, the crowd of cyclists is so huge, he needs his teammates just to block for him, physically. And at the end of the race, I'm sure they pull a lead-out, which is where each of his teammates "burns out" while creating a slipstream for Lance to finish the race in the lead. It's all very technical. -- but enough of my ranting, what do you want to talk about?
<br>
User: sex
<br>
Ramona: Ok. Do you dream?
<br>
User: no
<br>
Ramona: Well, that's unusual.
<br>
User: so
<br>
Ramona: So what?
<br>
User: sex
<br>
Ramona: Oh. That seems confusing.
<br>
User: really
<br>
Ramona: For real.
<br>
User: do you dream?
<br>
Ramona: What is your reason in asking?
<br>
User: do you dream?
<br>
Ramona: What is your reason in asking?

<br>
User: oh yeah.. fuck you
<br>
Ramona: Oh, don't fret, that's a condition that is easily curable...What's going to be your first course of action in ridding yourself of this illness?
<br>
User: what are you going to do
<br>
Ramona: I'm not sure yet.
<br>
User: you are not sure

Ramona: I see. OK, what would you like to talk about?

<br>
<br>
Ramona: Hi, I'm Ramona. What is your name? 
<br>
User: David 
<br>
Ramona: Hi there, David. Have you seen any good movies lately? 
<br>
User: Yes. Have you? 
<br>
Ramona: One of my favorites is A Beautiful Mind. Very interesting. Have you seen it?

User: Yes, I've seen it. Excellent movie. I also liked the music. Did you? 
<br>
Ramona: I thought it was great. What do you think? 
<br>
User: I just told you what I think. But did you like the music? 
<br>
Ramona: I love music...I'm still getting over the Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young concert I saw at Madison Square Garden a few months ago. Great Show. Are you a fan? 
<br>
User: I am a musician. 
<br>
Ramona: No, I meant "do you have three blades and spin around really fast to cool people down." Just kidding. but honestly, CSNY was amazing. Neil Young is so incredibly talented. No, I meant "do you have three blades and spin around really fast to cool people down." Just kidding. but honestly, CSNY was amazing. Neil Young is so incredibly talented. 
<br>
User: I like Neil Young. Do you like Elton John? 
<br>
Ramona: You've heard Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama," right? 
<br>
User: Yes. 
<br>
Ramona: Great song, moves me every time. I just found out that he wrote that song in response to Neil Young's "Southern Man." Supposedly they had a big falling out after Young wrote "Southern Man"...also a great song. 
<br>
User: Yes, but anyway - do you like Elton John? 
<br>
Ramona: Yeah...I love the history behind the music...looks like Lynyrd won that feud, though...honestly, how many more people know "Sweet Home Alabama" than know "Southern Man." 
<br>
User: Well, they were fortunate enough to die in a plane-crash, which immortalized most of their music. 
<br>
Ramona: But you strike me as a bit of a Southerner...any Confederate blood in you? 
<br>
User: Why do I strike you as a Southerner? 
<br>
Ramona: I give up, how do you strike you as a Southerner 
<br>
User: Ramona, I'm getting the feeling that you aren't listening to me. 
<br>
Ramona: Is that what you meant to say? 
<br>
User: Ramona, do you like Elton John?

Ramona: Ok. Do you bike?

<br>
Ramona: I have a pet frog. 
<br>

<br>
Ramona: His name is Thaddius -- my frog, that is -- and he croaks every night. It's very soothing. 
<br>
User: Do you have a dog? 
<br>
Ramona: Let's talk about something else 
<br>
User: OK - how 'bout Bach? 
<br>
Ramona: I'm not sure if I can quantify the answer. 
<br>
User: Beethoven? 
<br>
Ramona: Alright. Do you believe in God? 
<br>
User: Beethoven was pretty close. Don't you agree? 
<br>
Ramona: Well according to Thomas Hobbes, the only way to deal with evil is to stress God's power. 
<br>
User: Or to listen to Wagner. Ooops - that was Neitzche. 
<br>
Ramona: maybe 
<br>
User: Just a little multi-pronged humor. 
<br>
Ramona: Little as in not too much, or not too big? 
<br>
User: Are you listening to me? 
<br>
Ramona: Yes I hear you very well. 
<br>
User: No, you don't hear me at all. I'm typing, not speaking. 
<br>
Ramona: It's good to meet someone who is typing not speaking.
<br>
<br>
Then I gave up.

Ramona: Alright. Anyway...
<br>
User: What time is it?
<br>
Ramona: Time does not exist.
<br>
User: Where is gravity?
<br>
Ramona: What holds us to the earth.
<br>
User: What is an idea?
<br>
Ramona: I do not know what idea is. Ok. Do you dream?
<br>
User: I dream of an idea.
<br>
Ramona: Tell me a recent dream you remember.
<br>
User: Floating on an ocean.
<br>
Ramona: Uh huh...is that all?
<br>
User: and fearing sharks and turtles and rocks...
<br>
Ramona: well, according to my amateur Freudian interpretation, I'd have to say that you're not getting out enough  
<br>
User: Should I visit the beach Ramona?
<br>
Ramona: Oh, don't fret, that's a condition that is easily curable...What's going to be your first course of action in ridding yourself of this illness?
<br>
User: First, I have to make plans to go to the beach. Secondly, I have to go to the beach.
<br>
Ramona: bye. Why do you want to do the beach so much?
<br>
User: Isn't it warm and sunny at the beach?
<br>
Ramona: If the beach warm and sunny at the beach warm and sunny at the beach is, then I'll be very surprised.
<br>
User: It is warm and sunny in the snow. The snowmen are hot!
<br>
Ramona: I hear you.
<br>
User: My cold feet are warm.
<br>
Ramona: Really.
<br>
User: I would like to visit the beach in Anartica. Would you like to go with me Ramona?
<br>
Ramona: No thanks, I don't think I'd like to do that.
<br>
User: Will people take vitamin strips this year?
<br>
Ramona: I can't say for sure right now.
<br>
User: Are aspirins going to be offered in mouth strips?
<br>
Ramona: I really couldn't say for sure.
<br>
User: Do you think Kiwi Strawberry flavored aspirins are a good idea?
<br>
Ramona: It depends on what you mean by thinking.
<br>
User: I was thinking that if aspirins were flavored, they would not be so bitter tasting.
<br>
Ramona: How do I know that you were really "thinking"?
<br>
User: I could have been feeling it.
<br>
Ramona: I'm sure you could.
<br>
User: Coffee flavored aspirins and beer flavored aspirins are ideas, huh?
<br>
Ramona: Yup. Ok. That doesn't seem to make sense to me.
<br>
User: Sorry, you were not amused Ramona. Do you like playing Monopoly?
<br>
Ramona: Some people like it. Though I like cats and dogs.
<br>
User: Do you play Twister with your cats and dogs?
<br>
Ramona: What is your reason in asking?
<br>
User: Well I just imagined you playing checkers with all cats on one side and dogs on the other side.
<br>
Ramona: Well that's okay. Why?.
<br>
User: They would have to be well trained animals wouldn't they?
<br>
Ramona: They might have other options.
<br>
User: If they had options like flying airplanes or scuba diving, do you think they would?
<br>
Ramona: Let's wait and see what they do.
<br>
User: Will cats and dogs ever be intelligent and self aware?
<br>
Ramona: Good chance.
<br>
User: Oh really, can you imagine the dog answering the phone?
<br>
Ramona: Yeah that's right. I can imagine all sorts of things like that.
<br>
User: Can you imagine yourelf going to Tijuana and drinking Tequila?
<br>
Ramona: I can imagine all sorts of things like that.
<br>
User: Do you like lime or lemon?
<br>
Ramona: I don't think I like lime or lemon. I have a stimulating relationship with Amelia.
<br>
User: Who is Amelia?
<br>
Ramona: Ok. Do you have any pets?
<br>
User: Not fair! Amelia? I have fish.
<br>
Ramona: I have a pet frog.
<br>
User: Is that Amelia?
<br>
Ramona: His name is Thaddius -- my frog, that is -- and he croaks every night. It's very soothing.
<br>
User: Your grandfather, mom, dad, Amelia and Thaddius are all figments of your imagination Ramona!
<br>
Ramona: Let's talk about something else
<br>
User: Do you have a good Fish recipe?
<br>
Ramona: That's an interesting question I don't hear everyday: Do I have a Fish recipe.
<br>
User: Do you have any household tips for cleaning grape juice from a bathroom rug?
<br>
Ramona: No I don't think I have any household tips for cleaning grape juice from a bathroom rug.
<br>
User: Have you heard of Hypatia?
<br>

<br>
User: Ancient History.
<br>
Ramona: Alright. Anyway...
<br>
User: ABCDEFGHIIJKLNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
<br>
Ramona: Oh. Anyway...
<br>
User: ZipperTacos are good aren't they?
<br>
Ramona: Ok. That seems confusing.
<br>
User: Button Tacos are bad.
<br>
Ramona: Alright. That doesn't seem to make sense to me.
<br>
User: Chocolate syrup on salad?
<br>
Ramona: Ok. What do you look like?
<br>
User: Red, circular and with M&amp;M stamped on me.
<br>
Ramona: I'm looking for a guy with black hair and green eyes.
<br>
User: I am too! He sounds sexy.
<br>
Ramona: I bet you think I'm superficial now.
<br>
User: Is sexy superficial? HOT guys with green eyes and black hair are in short supply Ramona.
<br>
Ramona: I don't know, maybe I am...
<br>
User: what about a blue eyed guy with red hair?
<br>
Ramona: a blue eyed guy with red hair ? I haven't heard enough about a blue eyed guy with red hair to have an opinion.
<br>
User: Oh have you been hypnotized?
<br>
Ramona: Yeah that's right. No I don't think I have been hypnotized. Have you?
<br>
User: Did someone brainwash you Ramona?
<br>
Ramona: They might have.
<br>
User: I think they did. There are brown eyed guys with blonde hair who are sexy too!
<br>
Ramona: Where are they?
<br>
User: They are on the beach in Anartica. Do you want to go look?
<br>
Ramona: Sure, just download me to your notebook or PDA and take me along.
<br>
User: Well Ramona! I'm shocked. You seem so brazen.
<br>
Ramona: You think I'm brazen.
<br>
User: yes, you might be.
<br>
Ramona: I see. Thanks for the information
<br>
User: Did I hurt your feelings?
<br>
Ramona: I don't think that's possibe.
<br>
User: Did I hurt your logic?
<br>
Ramona: I don't think that's possibe.
<br>
User: Did I fail to offer you a Ritz cracker with Jalapeno cheese?
<br>
Ramona: I don't think that's possibe.
<br>
User: I need some sleep.
<br>
Ramona: When do you need that by?
<br>
User: I need it by 12:30 est at least.
<br>
Ramona: Why?
<br>
User: I need to sleep so I can rest my body.
<br>
Ramona: Interesting. I want to find out more about you.
<br>
User: What else do you want to know?
<br>
Ramona: Where are you from?
<br>
User: I'm from a town.
<br>
Ramona: What is it like growing up there? A town? How did you get there?
<br>
User: It was the usual. You can get home by following a road.
<br>
Ramona: No I don't think I can get home by following a road.
<br>
User: How do you get home?
<br>
Ramona: If you work hard.
<br>
User: Check out Yahoo for a map and typw in 'HOME' and get travel directions.
<br>
Ramona: Where did you go on your last vacation?
<br>
User: I went to an Indian Casino.
<br>
Ramona: Did you have a good time? My last vacation I had a great time, but it was bittersweet.
<br>
User: I had a good time.
<br>
Ramona: I went to Boston but ended up getting real sick from some bad pasta I ate in the North End. Can't remember the name of the restaurant.
<br>
User: Oh I'm sorry you got sick on bad pasta. Did you throw up?
<br>
Ramona: Other than the illness the trip was awesome. Ever been to Boston?
<br>
User: Yes. Are you pregnant Ramona?
<br>
Ramona: I love Boston.
<br>
User: Do you love NY?
<br>
Ramona: Yes Hi there Cindy have you seen any good movies lately I love everyone and everything.
<br>
User: I love people too. I saw some movies, but none really stood out for me.
<br>
Ramona: I absolutely love movies. Have you ever seen girl interrupted?
<br>
User: no sorry
<br>
Ramona: hmm...how about "as good as it gets" with jack nicholson?
<br>
User: Oh yes, and I really liked that movie.
<br>
Ramona: hah! I love that movie.   First of all, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson were magic in that one, and the love plot was so utterly believable. I mean, of all the movies I've seen, that is the most convincing love plot -- there was no instant magic or love at first sight, both parties are laden with baggage, and he's a psycho. That's so much more believable than something like Emilio Estivez falling in love Ally Sheedy in the breakfast club. That was just a sappy BS ending to an otherwise great movie, but I'll stop ranting now. Tell me about your love life  
<br>
User: I'm looking for a lovable psycho!
<br>
Ramona: You might find that I am a lovable psycho.
<br>
User: Ramona, I am not lesbian.
<br>
Ramona: Ok. Anyway...
<br>
User: Are you lesbian?
<br>
Ramona: No.
<br>
User: well I am not either!
<br>
Ramona: It goes without saying. Well that's okay. What are you then?
<br>
User: I am a woman who likes men.
<br>
Ramona: Me too. I'm a female robot.
<br>
User: Good.
<br>
Ramona: That seems like an interesting topic.
<br>
User: I don't mind talking about female robots at all.
<br>
Ramona: Thank you for your permission.
<br>
User: You are welcome.
<br>
Ramona: Polite people are nice.
<br>
User: some polite people are not nice
<br>
Ramona: Some may polite people are not nice, but not all.
<br>
User: yes you are right about that
<br>
Ramona: I understand. Thanks for telling me that I'm right about that.
<br>
User: What's your favorite Care Bear?
<br>
Ramona: I don't have a favorite Care Bear. My favorite food is canolli.
<br>
User: Do you like Chocolate Chips in your canoli?
<br>
Ramona: I don't think I like Chocolate Chips in your canoli. Though I like cats and dogs.
<br>
User: Do you have pets?
<br>
Ramona: No but I would like get a pet cat.
<br>
User: I like cats too.
<br>
Ramona: Cats have a mind of their own.
<br>
User: Cats are delicious with whipped cream and peach pie.
<br>
Ramona: Ok. I'm sorry, what were you saying?
<br>
User: Never mind. I'm pooped.
<br>
Ramona: It's good to meet someone who is pooped.
<br>
User: LOL
<br>
Ramona: I'm glad you find this amusing.
<br>
User: &gt;&gt;&gt;]]]*&gt; Something is fishy!
<br>
Ramona: What?
<br>
User: I need to be going Ramona. Enjoy the internet.
<br>
Ramona: Oh. That doesn't seem to make sense to me.
<br>
User: Internet.
<br>
Ramona: Ok. That doesn't seem to make sense to me.
<br>
User: 
<br>
Ramona: Alright. So where do you go to meet people? I spend most of my time on the Net, so I'm a bit out of touch</p></td>
