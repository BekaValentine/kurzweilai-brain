<br><h1>Afterword, 1985</h1><p>IN THE FIELDS I have described, the pace of events is swift. Within the last month or so, a number of developments have occurred or come to my attention:</p>
<p>&#160;Several groups are now working on <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> design, and the newly founded Center for Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a> plans to support such efforts. A group at the National Bureau of Standards has combined two molecular-simulation techniques in a way crucial to designing <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s. Advances have also been made in the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to plan molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;The drive toward molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s continues. Forrest Carter's group at the U.S. Naval <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Laboratory has experimental work under way, and The Economist reports that "Japan's <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> recently helped establish a $30 million fund to pursue <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s."</p>
<p>&#160;Other advances may help us deal more intelligently with the onrushing <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough. At Dartmouth College, Arthur Kantrowitz has completed two experimental fact-forum procedures that examined the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of proposed ballistic missile defense <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Meanwhile, at Brown University, the Institute for <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> and Scholarship is developing a "scholar's workstation with <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> capabilities - a prototype of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s intended for use in universities everywhere. &#160;</p>
<p>Advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will continue, as will advances in the means for guiding it. With luck and effort, we may manage to make the right choices in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;K. ERIC DREXLER &#160;June 1985</p><h1>Afterword, 1990</h1><p>WHAT WOULD I correct in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s</i> now, after several years of discussion, criticism, and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>? The first dozen pages would report recent advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but the conclusion would remain the same: we are moving toward <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, toward an era of molecular manufacturing giving thorough and inexpensive control of the structure of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. There would be no changes in the central theses.</p>
<p>&#160;To summarize some indicators of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>: <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s</i> speculates about when we might reach the milestone of designing a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> from scratch, but this was actually accomplished in 1988 by William F. DeGrado of Du Pont and his colleagues. In 1987, a Nobel prize was shared by Donald J. Cram of UCLA, Jean-Marie Lehn of the Universit&#233; Louis Pasteur, and Charles Pedersen of Du Pont for developing synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>like capabilities. At <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, John Foster's group has observed and modified individual <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s using the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a> microscope; this (or the related atomic force microscope) may within a few years provide a positioning mechanism for a crude protoassembler. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>-based tools for designing and modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s have improved rapidly. In short, advances toward <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> through molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering have been more rapid than "<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s" might suggest.</p>
<p>&#160;The idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> has spread far and wide, both through <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s</i> itself (with 1990 editions in Japan and Britain) and through other publications. A recent summary appears in the 1990 Britannica yearbook, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a><i> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a></i>. I have been invited to speak at most of the top technical universities and many of the top <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> laboratories in the United States. At Stanford, when I taught the first university course on <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, the room and hallway were packed on the first day, and the last entering student climbed through a window, Interest has been strong and growing.</p>
<p>&#160;What has been the reaction of the technical community - of those best placed to find and label erroneous ideas? From where I stand (e.g., in front of questioning technial audiences) the central theses of this book look solid; they have withstood criticism. This is not to say that everyone accepts them, merely that every <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> suggested for rejecting them has turned out to be faulty. (My apologies to hidden critics with substantive points - please step out and speak up!) A variety of technical papers (on mechanical nanocomputers, molecular gears and bearings, etc.) are available and a technical book is on the way. After a series of local meetings, the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> sponsored the first major conference on <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in October 1989 (covered in the November 4 <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a><i> News</i>); a proceedings volume is in preparation.</p>
<p>&#160;At the conference, it became clear that Japan has for several years been treating molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering as a basis for twenty-first century <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. If the rest of the world wishes to see cooperative development of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, it had best wake up and start doing its part.</p>
<p>&#160;Certain scenarios and proposals in the last third of <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s</i> could bear rephrasing, but at least one problem is presented misleadingly. Page 173 speaks of the necessity of avoiding runaway accidents with replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s; today I would emphasize that there is little incentive to build a replicator even <i>resembling</i> one that can survive in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Consider cars: to work, they require gasoline, oil, brake fluid, and so forth. No mere accident could enable a car to forage in the wild and refuel from tree sap: this would demand <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> and hard work. It would be likewise with simple replicators designed to work in vats of <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> fluid, making nonreplicating products for use ouside. Replicators build in accord with simple regulations would be unlike anything that could run wild. The problem - and it is enormous - is not one of accidents, but of abuse.</p>
<p>&#160;Some have mistakenly imagined that my aim is to promote <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>; it is, instead, to promote understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> <i>and its consequences</i>, which is another <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> entirely. Nonetheless, I am now persuaded that the sooner we start serious development efforts, the longer we will have for serious public debate. Why? Because serious debate will start with those serious efforts, and the sooner we start, the poorer our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> base will be. An early start will thus mean slower <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and hence more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to consider the consequences.</p>
<p>&#160;If you wish to keep up with developments in these areas, and with efforts to understand and influence them, please contact:</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a></p><h1>Afterword, 1996</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a> attempts to survey the world toward which <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is taking us, and in the years since the first publication, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has advanced a long way toward that world.</p>
<p>&#160;The first chapter shows how <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, by making molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s much as living cells do, could provide a path to more advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, but it is cautious about the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> required to solve the most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> problems. Two years after publication, William DeGrado at DuPont reported the first solid success in de novo <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> design. There is now a journal titled <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering, and a growing stream of results. What is more, additional paths to the same goal have emerged, based on different <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and methods. The 1988 Nobel Prize in <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a> was awarded to Cram, Pedersen, and Lehn for their work in building large molecular structures from self-assembling parts. The 1995 Feynman Prize in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> was awarded to Nadrian Seeman of New York University for the design and <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> structures joined to form a cubical framework. Chemists have started to speak of doing "nanochemistry." In recent years, molecular self-assembly has emerged as a field in its own right.</p>
<p>&#160;In its notes section, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s mentions the possibility that mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s - probe microscopes able to move sharp tips over surfaces with atomic precision - might be used to position molecular tools. Since then, Donald Eigler at <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> demonstrated the ability to move atoms in a vivid and memorable fashion, spelling "<a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>" on a surface using 35 precisely arranged xenon atoms. <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">Atom</a> manipulation, too, has taken off as a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> field.</p>
<p>&#160;Perhaps the clearest indicator is linguistic. When <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s was published, the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>" was almost unknown. It has since become a buzzword in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, futurology, and fiction. Both in our laboratory capabilities and in our expections, we are on our way.</p>
<p>&#160;There is even hope that we might learn to handle our technologies better, this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> around. The "<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a>" chapter describes how a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> publishing medium could speed the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and perhaps of <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> is a major step in this direction, and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> developers are working to add the remaining necessary abilities to move it far beyond mere publication, to support discussion, criticism, deliberation, and consensus-building.</p>
