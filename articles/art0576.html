<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>A few years ago I found myself on the stage of one of Tokyo's grandest 
              concert halls. I wasn't going to perform; Yo-Yo Ma was, if I could 
              fix his cello bow in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The position sensor that had worked so 
              well at MIT was no longer functioning after a trip around the world.</p>
<p>To a casual observer, Yo-Yo's <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> looked like a normal cello 
              that had lost a few pounds. The one obvious clue that something 
              was out of the ordinary was the racks of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s 
              behind it. These made the sound that the audience heard; the cello 
              was really just an elaborate input <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>.</p>
<p>Sensors measured everything Yo-Yo did as he played. A thin sandwich 
              of flexible foam near the end of the bow detected the force being 
              applied to it, and a rotary sensor measured the angle of his wrist 
              holding the bow. Strips under the strings recorded where they contacted 
              the fingerboard. Polymer films measured how the bridge and top plate 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> vibrated. In a conventional cello these vibrations 
              get acoustically amplified by the resonant cello body that acts 
              like a loudspeaker; here they were <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally amplified by <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s 
              in the solid body. The cello itself made no audible sound. A small 
              antenna on the bridge sent a radio signal that was detected by a 
              conducting plastic strip on the bow, determining the position of 
              the bow along the stroke and its distance from the bridge.</p>
<p>Earlier that day we had spent a few hours unpacking all of the 
              shipping crates, attaching the many cables, and booting up the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              Everything was going fine until we tried the bow. The position sensor 
              that I had developed to measure its position was erroneously indicating 
              that the bow was fluctuating wildly, even though it wasn't actually 
              moving. Fortunately, I had packed a small laboratory of test and 
              repair equipment. Given the amount of new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> being used 
              in a hostile environment (a concert hall stage), something unexpected 
              was certain to happen. Probing the signals let me narrow the problem 
              down to the fine cable coming from the bow antenna. Opening up its 
              protective insulation and shielding exposed an erratic connection, 
              which I could patch around with a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> more surgery on the inner 
              conductor. After I packed everything back up, the signals checked 
              out okay, and I could resume breathing.</p>
<p>There was an expectant buzz in the full hall as we connected the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, the cello, and Yo-Yo. The second unexpected <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> of 
              the evening came as I began to make my way back to the control console 
              where we were going to do some final <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> checks. I was only a 
              few feet into the audience when I heard the unmistakable sound of 
              Yo-Yo Ma controlling racks of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. The concert had begun. 
              As some newfound friends made room to squeeze me in, I felt the 
              way I imagined I will feel when my children leave home. The <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> 
              had become his more than ours; he no longer needed us. As he played, 
              the hall filled with familiar cello lines and unfamiliar sonic textures, 
              with recognizable notes and with thick layers of interwoven phrases, 
              all controlled by him. I sat back to enjoy the performance as a 
              listener, no longer an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>.</p>
<p>I was equally surprised and delighted to be there. This project 
              was both an artistic and a technical <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, asking how the 
              old <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of a cello could be enhanced by the new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Yo-Yo's real allegiance is to communicating musical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> to a listener; the cello is just the best way he's found 
              to do that. By introducing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> into the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> we could 
              let him control more sounds in more ways without sacrificing the 
              centuries of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> reflected in its <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> and his technique. 
              This was an ideal way to explore the role of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in music: 
              there was an enormous incentive to succeed, and it would be easy 
              to tell if we didn't.</p>
<p>My contribution had begun years earlier with my <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>/hate relationship 
              with bassoon reeds. As an enthusiastic amateur musician I was just 
              good enough to be able to get hopelessly out of my depth. One of 
              my perennial stumbling blocks was reed making. To create a reed, 
              cane from a particular region in France is seasoned, shaped, cut, 
              trimmed, wrapped, sealed, shaved, tested, aged, played, shaved some 
              more, played again, trimmed a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>, on and on, until, if the reed 
              gods smile on you, the reed finally speaks over the whole range 
              of pitch and volume of the bassoon. Almost imperceptible changes 
              in the thickness of the reed in particular places can have a salutary 
              or devastating effect on the color of the sound, or the <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> 
              of the attacks, or the stability of the pitch, or the effort required 
              to make a sound. The reward for all of this trouble is playing one 
              of the most expressive of all musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. The same sensitivity 
              that makes it so difficult to put together a good reed also lets 
              the reed respond to subtle changes in the distribution of pressure 
              and airflow as it is played. When it works well I have trouble telling 
              where I stop and the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> begins.</p>
<p>For a few weeks, that is, until the reed becomes soggy and the 
              whole process starts all over again. The cane softens, cracks, and 
              wears away, reducing the reed to buzzing noodles. This is why I 
              was ready to embrace the convenience of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>s 
              when I first encountered them. I was a graduate student at Cornell 
              working on <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in the basement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> building, 
              crossing the street to go to the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> building to play my bassoon 
              for therapy. I didn't realize that I was literally following in 
              the footsteps of Bob Moog.</p>
<p>A few decades earlier he had walked the same route, leaving his 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> building to invent the modern <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>. 
              He was struck by a parallel between the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ear and the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, 
              which was just becoming <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly available. Both <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s respond 
              exponentially rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly. This means that each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the 
              amplitude or frequency of a sound is doubled, the perceived intensity 
              or pitch increases by the same fixed amount. A low octave on a piano 
              might span 100 to 200 Hz; another <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of twelve keys farther up 
              the keyboard might go from 1000 to 2000 Hz. The same thing is true 
              of the current flowing through a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> in response to an applied 
              control voltage. This is what let Bob make <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s that could be 
              played like any other musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>.</p>
<p>Moog began building modules with <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s to control 
              the frequency of oscillators, the volume of amplifiers, or the cutoff 
              of filters. Patching together these modules resulted in great sounds 
              that could be used in musically satisfying ways. As Bob's musical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s grew more and more capable, he spent less and less <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> lab, until his advisor got rid of him by giving him 
              a degree. This was fortunate for the rest of the world, which was 
              transformed by the company Bob then founded. The progeny of the 
              Moog <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> can be heard in the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> sounds in almost 
              any popular recording.</p>
<p>At Cornell this legacy came to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> for me when I encountered one 
              of Bob's early synths still in use in the basement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> 
              building. It belonged to David Borden, the composer who had used 
              Bob's original <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>s to start the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> 
              ensemble. David also had a useful talent for breaking anything <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              by looking at it; when one of Bob's modules could survive the Borden 
              test, then it was ready to be sold.</p>
<p>David was in the process of updating Cornell's studio to catch 
              up to the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world. The studio had languished since Bob's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              as the department specialized in the performance practice of early 
              acoustic musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, leaving it with the earliest <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              ones also. As David filled the studio with the latest <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized 
              synths, I found it liberating to come in and push a button and have 
              the most amazing sounds emerge. Even better, the sound was there 
              the next day, and the next month; I didn't have to worry about it 
              becoming soggy.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that was also the problem. The nuance that made 
              my bassoon so beloved was lost in the clinical perfection of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> sounds. Unlike the bassoon, there was no ambiguity as 
              to what part I did and what part it did: I pressed the button, it 
              beeped. I began to give up on the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and go back to my real 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>.</p>
<p>As I walked back and forth between the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> building and the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> 
              building I realized that I was doing something very silly. A bassoon 
              is governed by the same laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> as the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, 
              including my <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s. It may be a mystery why we like 
              to listen to a bassoon, but the equations that govern its behavior 
              are not. Perhaps I could come up with a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of measurements and 
              models that could reproduce its response, retaining what I like 
              about the bassoon but freeing me from the Sisyphian task of reed 
              making.</p>
<p>Directly comparing a bassoon and an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> makes 
              clear just how impressive the bassoon really is. Even though its 
              design is centuries old, it responds more quickly and in more complex 
              ways to finer changes in more aspects of the musician's <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. 
              It's not surprising that when playing a <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> one feels that 
              something's missing.</p>
<p>From across the street in the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> department, it occurred to 
              me that, instead of leaving the lab to make <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, I could stay 
              there and use its resources to update the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> with everything 
              that's been learned about sensing and computing since Bob Moog's 
              day. As I began the preliminary analysis that precedes any <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, I was startled to realize that for the purpose of making 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are beginning to exceed the performance of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>There are relevant limits on both the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> and the player. 
              Displacements of a cello bow that travel less than about a millimeter 
              or happen faster than about a millisecond are not audible. This 
              means that the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> rate needed to determine the bow's position 
              matches that generated by a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>. Even including the extra 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> needed to describe the bow pressure and angle, and the 
              positions of the fingers on the strings, the amount of gestural 
              input <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> generated by a player is easily handled by a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. If we 
              use the specifications of a CD player to estimate the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> rate 
              for the resulting sound, this is also easily handled by a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. Finally, 
              the effective <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al speed of the cello can be found by recognizing 
              that the stiffness and damping in the materials that it is made 
              of restrict its response to vibrations that occur over distances 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of millimeters, at a frequency of tens of thousands 
              of cycles per second. A mathematical model need not keep track of 
              anything happening smaller or faster than that. Dividing the size 
              of the cello by these <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s results in an upper limit of billions 
              of mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s per second for a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to model a 
              cello in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. This is the speed of today's <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s, 
              and will soon be that of a fast workstation.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that with appropriate sensors, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> should 
              be able to compete with a Stradivarius. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I appreciated 
              this I was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> of Fellows. The 
              regular formal dinners of the <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> provided an ideal setting 
              to develop this argument, but not a Stradivarius to try it out on. 
              That came when I met a former Junior Fellow, <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, at one 
              of the dinners. He called my bluff and invited me down to the other 
              end of Cambridge to visit the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab and take the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> 
              seriously.</p>
<p>Marvin introduced me to Tod Machover, a composer at the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab. 
              Starting with his days directing <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> at IRCAM, the pioneering 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> laboratory in Paris, Tod has spent many years designing and 
              writing for smart <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. Classically, <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> has had a clear 
              division of labor. The composer puts notes on a page, the musician 
              interprets the shorthand representation of the composer's intent 
              by suitable gestures, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> turns those gestures into 
              sounds. There's nothing particularly fundamental about that arrangement. 
              It reflects what has been the prevailing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for distributing 
              music&amp;#8212a piece of paper. Notes are a very low level for describing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers have moved from specifying the 
              primitive instructions understood by a processor to writing in higher-level 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s matched to application <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> or 
              bookkeeping, a more intelligent musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> could let a composer 
              specify how sounds result from the player's <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s in more abstract 
              ways than merely listing notes. The point is not to eliminate the 
              player, it is to free the player to concentrate on the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>.</p>
<p>Tod had been discussing this idea with Yo-Yo, who was all too aware 
              of the limits of his cello. While he's never found anything better 
              for musical <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, his cello can play just one or two notes 
              at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it's hard to move quickly between notes played at opposite 
              ends of a string, and the timbral range is limited to the sounds 
              that a bowed string can make. Within these limits a cello is wonderfully 
              lyrical; Yo-Yo was wondering what might lie beyond them.</p>
<p>As Tod, Yo-Yo, and I compared notes, we realized that we were all 
              asking the same question from different directions: how can new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> build on the old mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of musical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s without sacrificing what we all loved about traditional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s? We decided to create a new kind of cello, to play a 
              new kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>.</p>
<p>My job was to find ways to measure everything that Yo-Yo did when 
              he played, without interfering with his performance. Sensors determined 
              where the bow was, how he held it, and where his fingers were on 
              the strings. These were connected to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med by a 
              team of Tod's students, led by Joe Chung, to perform low-level calibration 
              (where is the bow?), mid-level analysis (what kind of bow technique 
              is being used?), and high-level mapping (what kind of sound should 
              be associated with that <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>?). The sounds were then produced 
              by a collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>s and signal processors under control 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>Tod, who is also a cellist, wrote a piece called <i>Begin Again 
              Again</i> . . . that looked like conventionally notated cello <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> 
              (since that is what Yo-Yo plays), but that also specified the rules 
              for how the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> generated sounds in response to what Yo-Yo 
              did. Yo-Yo's essential role in the development was to bridge between 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>. He helped me understand what parts of 
              his technique were relevant to measure, and what parts were irrelevant 
              or would be intrusive to include, and he helped Tod create musical 
              mappings that could use these <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in ways that were artistically 
              meaningful and that built on his technique.</p>
<p>While the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> of the cello never changed, in each 
              section of the resulting piece the instructions the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> followed 
              to make sounds did. In effect, Yo-Yo played a new <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> in 
              each section, always starting from traditional practice but adding 
              new capabilities. For example, an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant part of a cellist's 
              technique is associated with the bow placement. Bowing near the 
              bridge (called <i>ponticello</i>) makes a bright, harsh sound; bowing 
              near the fingerboard makes a softer, sweeter sound. In one section 
              of the piece these mappings were extended so that playing <i>ponticello</i> 
              made still brighter sounds than a cello could ever reach. Another 
              essential part of playing a cello is the trajectory of the bow before 
              a note starts and after it ends. Not unlike a golf swing or baseball 
              throw, the preparation and follow-through are necessary parts of 
              the bow stroke. In addition, these gestures serve as cues that help 
              players communicate with each other visually as well as aurally. 
              These influences came together in a section of the piece that used 
              the trajectory of his bow to launch short musical phrases. The location 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of the bow controlled the volume and tempo of a sequence 
              of notes rather than an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> note. Yo-Yo described this as 
              feeling exactly like ensemble playing, except that he was the ensemble. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would pick up on his bowing cues and respond appropriately, 
              in turn influencing his playing.</p>
<p>Developing the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> was a humbling <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. I expected 
              to be able to use a few off-the-shelf sensors to make the measurements; 
              what I found was that the cello is such a mature, tightly integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that most anything I tried was sure to either fail or make 
              something else worse. Take a task as apparently simple as detecting 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the strings. The first thing that I tried was inspired 
              by the pickup of an electric guitar, which uses a permanent magnet 
              to induce a current in a moving string, in turn creating a magnetic 
              field that is detected by a coil. Since a cello string is much farther 
              from the fingerboard than a guitar string, I had to design a pickup 
              with a much stronger magnet and more sensitive amplifier. This let 
              me make the measurement out to the required distance, obtaining 
              a nice electrical signal when I plucked the string. When this worked, 
              I proudly called the others in to try out my new <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>.</p>
<p>To my horror there was no signal when the string was bowed, even 
              though I had just seen it working. Some more testing revealed the 
              problem: bowing made the string move from side to side, but my sensor 
              responded only to the up-and-down <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the string that resulted 
              when I plucked it.</p>
<p>Plan B was to place between the strings and the bridge a thin polymer 
              sheet that creates a voltage when compressed. By carefully lining 
              the bridge with the polymer I was able to get a nice measurement 
              of the string vibration. Pleased with this result, and ignoring 
              recent <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, I called everyone back in to see it work. And 
              then I watched them leave again when the signal disappeared as the 
              cello was bowed. Here the problem was that the bowing excited a 
              rocking mode of the bridge that eliminated most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a> 
              force that the polymer strips were measuring.</p>
<p>A similar <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of difficulties came up in following the movement 
              of the bow. Sonar in air, sonar in the strings, optical tracking, 
              radars, each ran afoul of some kind of subtle interaction in the 
              cello. It was only after failing with these increasingly complicated 
              solutions that I found the simple trick we used. I was inspired 
              by a baton for conducting a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that was developed by Max Mathews, 
              a scientist from <a class="thought" href="entries/bell_labs_entry.html">Bell Labs</a> who was the first person to use a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              to make <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. His <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> measured the position of the baton by 
              the variation in a radio signal picked up in a large flat antenna 
              shaped like a backgammon board. This was much too big to fit on 
              a cello, but I realized that I could obtain the same kind of response 
              from a thin strip of a material placed on the bow that was made 
              out of poor conductor so that the signal strength it received from 
              a small antenna on the bridge would vary as a function of the bow 
              position.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the preparations were the rehearsals 
              at MIT where the emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> came together with 
              the composition and the musical mappings. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> evolved around 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s of the others to grow into an integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>. 
              When everything was working <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably reliably, we packed up and 
              headed off for the premiere performance at Tanglewood in western 
              Massachusetts. It was hard to miss our arrival when, for the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, Yo-Yo went on stage to try out the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>A cello can only sound so loud. Beyond that, players spend a lifetime 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> tricks in how they articulate notes to seem to sound louder 
              and to better cut through an accompanying orchestra. There's nothing 
              profound about this aspect of technique; it's simply what must be 
              done to be heard with a conventional cello. But we had given Yo-Yo 
              an unconventional cello that could play as loud as he wanted, and 
              play he did. He unleashed such a torrent of sound that it threatened 
              to drown out the concert going on in the main shed. This was great 
              fun for everyone involved (except perhaps the people attending the 
              concert next door).</p>
<p>A similar thing happened the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> he tried the <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> bow 
              sensor. Instead of playing what he was supposed to be rehearsing, 
              he went off on a tangent, making sounds by conducting with his bow 
              instead of touching the strings at all. After a lifetime of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              about the implications of how he moved his bow through the air, 
              he could finally hear it explicitly.</p>
<p>As the rehearsals <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed we found that eliminating many other 
              former <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s on cello practice became easy <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              design. It's taken for granted that the cellist, conductor, and 
              audience should all hear the same thing, even though they're listening 
              for different things, and are in different acoustic environments. 
              We found that Yo-Yo was best able to play with a sound mix in his 
              monitor speakers that highlighted his performance cues, different 
              from the sound mix that filled the hall. Such a split is impossible 
              to do with an acoustic cello but was trivial with ours.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise for me was the strength of the critical reaction, 
              both positive and negative, to connecting a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and a cello. 
              Great musicians loved what we were doing because they care about 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, not the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. They have an unsentimental understanding 
              of the strengths and weaknesses of their <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, and are unwilling 
              to use anything inferior but are equally eager to transcend all-too-familiar 
              limitations. Beginners loved what we were doing because they don't 
              care about the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> either, they just want to make <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. 
              They're open to anything that helps them do that. And in between 
              were the people who hated the project.</p>
<p>They complained that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was already intruding on too many 
              parts of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and here we were ruining one of the few remaining 
              unspoiled creative <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s. This reaction is based on the curious 
              belief that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and a cello isn't. In fact, 
              musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s have always been improved by drawing on the 
              newest available technologies. The volume of early pianos was limited 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that could be stored in the strings, which in turn 
              was limited by the strength of the wood and metal that held them. 
              Improvements in metallurgy made possible the casting of iron frames 
              that could withstand tons of force, creating the modern piano, which 
              is what enabled Beethoven to write his thunderous concertos. Popular 
              musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s have continued to grow and change, but classical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s have become frozen along with much of their repertoire. 
              The only role for new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is in helping people passively 
              listen to a small group of active performers.</p>
<p>What our critics were really complaining about were the excesses 
              of blindly introducing inferior new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> into successful mature 
              designs. Given that a Stradivarius effectively computes as fast 
              as the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>, it's no wonder that most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> to date has lacked the nuance of a Strad. Just as with <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              books, rather than reject new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> out of hand it is much 
              more challenging and interesting to ask that it work better than 
              what it intends to replace.</p>
<p>Here our report card is mixed. We made a cello that let Yo-Yo do 
              new things, but our <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> couldn't match his Strad at what 
              it does best. I view that as a temporary lapse; I'll be disappointed 
              if we can't make a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> Stradivarius in the next few years. That's 
              admittedly a presumptuous expectation, needing an explanation of 
              how we're going to do it, and why.</p>
<p>Luthiers have spent centuries failing to make <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s that 
              can match a Strad. Their frustrating inability to reproduce the 
              lost magic of the Cremona school has led them to chase down many 
              blind alleys trying to copy past practice. The nadir might have 
              been an attempt to use a rumored magic ingredient in the original 
              varnish, pig's urine. Better results have come from trying to copy 
              the mechanical function of a Strad instead of its exact design.</p>
<p>By bouncing a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beam off of a violin as it is played, it is 
              possible to measure tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s in the body. These studies have 
              led to the unexpected discovery that modes in which the left and 
              right sides of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> vibrate together sound bad, and modes 
              in which they move asymmetrically sound good. This helps explain 
              the presence of the tuning peg inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, as well as 
              why the two sides of a violin are not shaved identically. <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">Instrument</a>s 
              built with frequent testing by such modern analytical tools have 
              been steadily improving, not yet surpassing the great old <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s 
              but getting closer.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> in duplicating a Stradivarius is now coming from an unexpected 
              quarter. Physicists have spent millennia studying musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, 
              solely for the pleasure of understanding how they work. &gt;From Pythagoras's 
              analysis of a vibrating string, to Helmholtz's discovery in the 
              last century of the characteristic <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of a string driven by 
              the sticking and slipping of a bow (found with a vibrating microscope 
              he invented by mounting an eyepiece on a tuning fork), to Nobel 
              laureate <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. V. Raman's more recent study of the role of stiffness 
              in the strings of Indian musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, these efforts have 
              helped apply and develop new physical theories without any expectation 
              of practical applications. The work generally has been done on the 
              side by people who kept their day jobs; a recent definitive text 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s starts with a somewhat defiant 
              justification of such an idle fancy. <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a> is now turning 
              this study on its head.</p>
<p>The world isn't getting any faster (even though it may feel that 
              way), but <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are. Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can solve in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              the equations describing the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of a violin, the model can replace 
              the violin. Given a fast <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and good sensors, all of the accumulated 
              descriptions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s become playable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s themselves. This is why I expect to be able to create 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> Stradivarius. I'm not smarter than the people who tried 
              before and failed; I'm just asking the question at an opportune 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>I also think that I know the secret of a Strad. When we sent the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from Yo-Yo's sensors to almost any sound source, the result 
              still sounded very much like Yo-Yo playing. The essence of his artistry 
              lies in how he shapes the ten or so <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s of a note that are 
              available to him, not in the details of the waveform of the note. 
              Much of the value of a Strad lies not in a mysterious <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> 
              of the sound it makes, but rather in its performance as a controller. 
              Where a lesser <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> might drop out as a note is released or 
              waver when a note is sustained, a Strad lets a skilled player make 
              sharp or soft attacks, smooth or abrupt releases. This translates 
              into effective specifications for the resolution and response rate 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>, something we've already found that we can match. 
              This is the second <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that I'm optimistic about making a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              Strad: much of the problem lies in tractable <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering questions 
              about sensor performance.</p>
<p>For a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to emulate a Stradivarius it must also store a description 
              of it. Right now this sort of problem is solved most commonly in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s by recording samples of sounds and 
              playing them back. This is how most <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> pianos work. The advantage 
              is that a short segment of sound is guaranteed to sound good, since 
              it's a direct replica of the original. The disadvantage is readily 
              apparent in listening to more than a short segment. The samples 
              can't change, and so they can't properly respond to the player. 
              The result lacks the fluid <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of a traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>.</p>
<p>An alternative to storing samples is to use a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to directly 
              solve a mathematical model of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>. This is now possible 
              on the fastest <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s and will become feasible on more widely 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Aside from the demand for very powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              the difficulty with this approach is that it's not much easier than 
              building an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> the old-fashioned way. Even if the wood and 
              strings are specified as <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> models they must still match the 
              properties of the real wood and strings. That's exactly the problem 
              that's remained unsolved over the last few centuries.</p>
<p>A better alternative lies between the extremes of playing back 
              samples and solving physical models. Just as luthiers began to <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              when they moved their focus from how a Stradivarius is built to 
              how it performs, the same lesson applies to mathematical modeling. 
              Instead of trying to copy the construction of an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, it's 
              possible to copy its function. We can put our sensors on a great 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> and record the player's <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s along with the resulting 
              sound. After accumulating such <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> covering the range of what the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> is capable of, we can apply modern <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> analysis techniques 
              to come up with an efficient model that can reproduce how the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> 
              turns gestures into sounds. At that point we can throw away the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> (or lovingly display it to admire the craftsmanship and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>) and keep the functionally equivalent model. You can view 
              this as sampling the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> instead of sampling 
              the sound. Once the model has been found, it can be played with 
              the original sensors, or used in entirely new ways. Soon after we 
              were first able to model violin bowing with this kind of analysis 
              I was surprised to come into my lab and see my student Bernd Schoner 
              playing his arm. He had put the bow position sensor into the sleeve 
              of his shirt so that he could play a violin without needing to hold 
              a violin.</p>
<p>Granting then that a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> Stradivarius may be possible in the 
              not-too-distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, it's still fair to ask what the point is. 
              The obvious <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for the effort is to make the joy of playing 
              a Strad <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible to many more people. There are very few Strads 
              around, and they're regularly played by even fewer people. Even 
              worse, the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s that aren't in routine use because they're 
              so valuable suffer from problems similar to those of an automobile 
              that isn't driven regularly. If we can match the performance of 
              a Strad with easily duplicated sensors and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, then playing 
              a great <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> doesn't need to be restricted to a select few.</p>
<p>Beyond helping more people do what a small group can do now, making 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> Stradivarius helps great players do things that no one 
              can do now. As we found in the project with Yo-Yo, traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s 
              have many limitations that just reflect <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s of their old 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. By making a virtual Stradivarius that is as good as 
              the real thing, it's then possible to free players from those <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              without asking them to compromise their existing technique.</p>
<p>Making a Strad cheaper, or better, is a worthy goal, but one that 
              directly touches only the small fraction of the population that 
              can play the cello. There's a much more significant implication 
              for everyone else. Right now you can listen to a recording of Bach's 
              cello suites, or you can play them yourself. It takes a lifetime 
              to learn to do the latter well, and along the way the suites don't 
              sound particularly good. But when a Stradivarius merges with a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> 
              then this divide becomes a continuum. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could emulate 
              your CD player and play the suites for you, or your bowing could 
              control just the tempo, or you could take over control of the phrasing, 
              on up to playing them the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y executive was once given the chance to conduct the New 
              York Philharmonic; afterward when asked how he did, a player commented, 
              "It was fine; he pretended to conduct, and we pretended to follow 
              him." That's exactly what a smart musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> should do: 
              give you as much control as you want and can use, and intelligently 
              fill in the rest.</p>
<p>Now this is an exciting consequence of bringing computing and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> 
              together. It used to be that many people played <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, because that 
              was the only way to hear it. When mass <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> came along, <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> 
              split into a small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people paid to be artistically creative 
              and a much larger <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> that passively consumes their output. Reducing 
              the effort to learn to play an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, and opening up the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> 
              between a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>, a CD player, and a Stradivarius, points to the possibility 
              that far more people will be able to creatively express themselves. 
              Improving the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for making <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> can help engage instead 
              of insulate people.</p>
<p>There's a final <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why it's worth trying to make a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              Stradivarius: it's hard. The most serious criticism of so many demos 
              of new <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s between people and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s&#8212;say, the latest 
              and greatest <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment&#8212;is that it's hard 
              even to say if they're particularly good or bad. So what if they 
              let you stack some virtual blocks? The situation is very different 
              with a cello, where the centuries of <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> embodied in the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> 
              and the player make it very easy to tell when you fail. The discipline 
              of making an <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> good enough for Yo-Yo Ma ended up teaching 
              us many lessons about the design of sensors and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that are 
              much more broadly applicable to any interaction with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">Constraint</a>s really are key. If you venture off without them it's 
              easy to get lost. One of the most depressing days I've ever spent 
              was at a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> conference full of bad <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and bad 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. Too many people there told the musicians that they were <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers that they were musicians, while doing a poor job 
              at being either. Increasingly, we can make sensors for, and models 
              of, almost anything. If this kind of interactivity is done blindly, 
              everything will turn out sounding brown. Technologists should be 
              the last people guiding and shaping the applications; accepting 
              the challenge presented by a Stradivarius is one demanding way to 
              ground the effort.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the project with Yo-Yo, I asked him when he would 
              be ready to leave his cello behind and use our <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> instead. 
              His answer was instant. Rather than speculate about the irreproducible 
              joys of his Strad, he jumped to the practical <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of making 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. He tours constantly and needs to be able to get out of a 
              plane, open his case, and start playing. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> took the form 
              of several cases of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> tended to by a small army of students, 
              and it took a few hours to boot up and get working. It's not until 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can be as unobtrusive and invisible as that of the 
              Strad that he could prefer it instead. It must always be available 
              for use, never fail, and need no special <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> or maintenance. 
              That imperative to make <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> so good that it disappears lies 
              behind much of the work in this book.</p>
