<div class="TeaserText">Within 25 years, we'll reverse-engineer the brain and go on to develop superintelligence. Extrapolating the exponential growth of computational capacity (a factor of at least 1000 per decade), we'll expand inward to the fine forces, such as strings and quarks, and outward. Assuming we could overcome the speed of light limitation, within 300 years we would saturate the whole universe with our intelligence. </div>

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> has been <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up in an exquisitely specific way so 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> could produce the people that are sitting here today 
              [at Edge's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613235047/http://www.edge.org/documents/day2/day2.html" target="_blank">REBOOTING 
              CIVILIZATION II</a> meeting on July 21, 2002] and we could use our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to talk about the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. We see a formidable power 
              in the ability to use our minds and the tools we've created to gather 
              evidence, to use our inferential abilities to develop theories, 
              to test the theories, and to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> at increasingly 
              precise levels. That's one role of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. The theories that 
              we heard on <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> look at the evidence that exists in the world 
              today to make inferences about what existed in the past so that 
              we can develop models of how we got here. </p>
<p>Then, of course, we can run those models and project what might 
              happen in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Even if it's a little more difficult to test 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> theories, we can at least deduce, or induce, that certain 
              phenomena that we see today are evidence of times past, such as 
              radiation from billions of years ago. We can't really test what 
              will happen billions or trillions of years from now quite as directly, 
              but this line of inquiry is legitimate, in terms of understanding 
              the past and the derivation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. As we heard today, 
              the question of the origin of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is certainly not resolved. 
              There are competing theories, and at several times we've had theories 
              that have broken down, once we acquired more precise evidence.</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, however, we don't hear discussion about the role 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. According to common <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              is irrelevant to cosmological <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. It is just a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of froth 
              dancing in and out of the crevices of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and has no effect 
              on our ultimate cosmological destiny. That's not my view. The <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              has been <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up exquisitely enough to have <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. There are 
              intelligent entities like ourselves that can contemplate the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              and develop models about it, which is interesting. <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> 
              is, in fact, a powerful force and we can see that its power is going 
              to grow not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly but exponentially, and will ultimately be powerful 
              enough to change the destiny of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>I want to propose a case that <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8212;specifically <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, but not necessarily <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8212;will 
              trump <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>, or at least trump the dumb forces of <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>. 
              The forces that we heard discussed earlier don't have the qualities 
              that we posit in intelligent decision-making. In the grand celestial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, forces deplete themselves at a certain point and other 
              forces take over. Essentially you have a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that's dominated 
              by what I call dumb <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, because it's controlled by fairly simple 
              mechanical processes.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> possesses a different type of force with a certain 
              scope and a certain power. It's changing the shape and destiny of 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. Consider, for example, asteroids and meteors. Small 
              ones hit us on a fairly regular basis, but the big ones hit us every 
              some tens of millions of years and have apparently had a big impact 
              on the course of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. That's not going to happen 
              again. If it happened next year we're not quite ready to deal with 
              it, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen next year. When 
              it does happen again our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be quite sufficient. We'll 
              see it coming, and we will deal with it. We'll use our <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              to send up a probe and blast it out of the sky. You can score one 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in terms of trumping the natural unintelligent 
              forces of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>Commanding our local area of the sky is, of course, very small 
              on a cosmological scale, but <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can overrule these physical 
              forces, not by literally repealing the natural laws, but by manipulating 
              them in such a supremely sublime and subtle way that it effectively 
              overrules these laws. This is particularly the case when you get 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry that can operate at nano and ultimately femto and pico 
              scales. Whereas the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> still apply, they're being manipulated 
              now to create any outcome the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of this <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> 
              decides on.</p>
<h3>How <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> developed</h3>
<p>Let me back up and talk about how <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> came about. Wolfram's 
              book has prompted a lot of talk recently on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and on the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>. Earlier 
              today, <a class="thought" href="entries/lloyd_entry.html">Seth Lloyd</a> talked about the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and its 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. What Wolfram leaves out in 
              talking about <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> is how you get intelligent entities. 
              As you run these <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>, they create interesting pictures, 
              but the interesting thing about <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>, which was shown 
              long before Wolfram pointed it out, is that you can get apparently 
              random behavior from deterministic processes.</p>
<p>It's more than apparent that you literally can't predict an outcome 
              unless you can simulate the process. If the process under consideration 
              is the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, then presumably you can't simulate it unless 
              you step outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. But when Wolfram says that this explains 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> we see in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, it's leaving out one <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              step. As you run the <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>, you don't see the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>&amp;#8212at least, certainly he's never run them long 
              enough to see any <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in what I would call <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. You need 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>Marvin talked about some of the early stages of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. It starts 
              out very slow, but then something with some power to sustain itself 
              and to overcome other forces is created and has the power to self-replicate 
              and preserve that <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> works by indirection. It 
              creates a capability and then uses that capability to create the 
              next. It took billions of years until this chaotic swirl of mass 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> created the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing, structural backbone 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, and then used that <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to create the next stage. </p>
<p>With <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> had an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to record 
              its <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s and conduct <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s in a more orderly way. So 
              the next stage, such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion, went a lot faster, 
              taking only a few tens of millions of years. The <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion 
              then established body plans that became a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, meaning 
              that we didn't need to evolve body plans any more.</p>
<p>These designs worked well enough, so <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> could then concentrate 
              on higher cortical function, establishing another level of mechanism 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s that could do <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing. At this point, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s developed brains and nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that could process 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, and then that evolved and continued to accelerate. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> evolved in only hundreds of thousands of years, and 
              then the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> again worked by indirection to 
              use this product of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> creating <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> 
              to survive, to create the next stage: <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, a continuation 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> by other means.</p>
<h3>The <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a></h3>
            The first stages of technologies, like stone tools, fire, and the 
            wheel took tens of thousands of years, but then we had more powerful 
            tools to create the next stage. A thousand years ago, a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> 
            like the printing press took only a century or so to be adopted, and 
            this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has accelerated ever since. Fifty years ago, the first 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were designed with pencil on paper, with screwdrivers and 
            wire. Today we have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to design <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> designers 
            will design some high-level <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s, and twelve levels of intermediate 
            design are computed automatically. The process of designing a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
            now goes much more quickly. 
            <p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary processes accelerate, and the returns from an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process grow in power. I've called this theory "The Law of 
              Accelerating Returns." The returns, including economic returns, 
              accelerate. Stemming from my interest in being an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, I've 
              been developing mathematical models of this because I quickly realized 
              that an <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> has to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> when the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is finished, 
              not when it was started, since the world is generally a different 
              place three or four years later.</p>
<p>One exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that people are familiar with is Moore's 
              Law, which is really just one specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s. It's remarkable how long it's lasted, but 
              it wasn't the first, but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> to computing. Earlier, we had electro-mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, 
              using relays and <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers were shrinking the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> 
              tubes, making them smaller and smaller, until finally that <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> 
              ran out of steam because they couldn't keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> any more. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">Transistor</a>s were already in use in radios and other small, niche 
              applications, but when the mainstream <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of computing finally 
              ran out of steam, it <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ed to this other <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that was 
              already waiting in the wings to provide ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>. 
              It was a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>. Later, there was a shift to integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and at some point, <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s will run out of 
              steam.</p>
<p>Ten or 15 years from now we'll go to the third dimension. Of course, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on three-dimensional computing is well under way, because 
              as the end of one <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> becomes clear, this <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> increases 
              the pressure for the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> to create the next. We've seen tremendous 
              acceleration of molecular computing in the last several years. </p>
<p>When my book, <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i>, came out about 
              four years ago, the idea that three-dimensional molecular computing 
              could be feasible was quite controversial, and a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              scientists didn't believe it was. Today, there is a universal belief 
              that it's feasible, and that it will arrive in plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> before 
              <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> runs out. We live in a three-dimensional world, so we 
              might as well use the third dimension. That will be the sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> is one <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> among many that have provided exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, but <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is not the only <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              that has grown exponentially. We see something similar in any <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              particularly in ones that have any relationship to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. 
            </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> project, for example, was not a mainstream project when 
              it was announced. People <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> it was ludicrous that you could 
              scan the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> in 15 years, because at the rate at which you could 
              scan it when the project began, it could take thousands of years. 
              But the scanning has doubled in speed every year, and actually most 
              of the work was done in the last year of the project.</p>
<p>Magnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> storage is not covered under <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, since it 
              involves packing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on a magnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>, which is a 
              completely different <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of applied <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, but magnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> storage 
              has very regularly doubled every year. In fact there's a second 
              level of acceleration. It took us three years to double the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> 
              of computing at the beginning of the century, and two years in the 
              middle of the century, but we're now doubling it in less than one 
              year. </p>
<p>This is another feedback loop that has to do with past technologies, 
              because as we improve the price performance, we put more resources 
              into that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. If you plot <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, as I've done, on a 
              logarithmic scale, where a straight line would mean exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, you see another exponential. There's actually a double rate 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>.</p>
<p>Another very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> is the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>. 
              This is harder to measure, but even though people can argue about 
              some of the details and assumptions in these charts you still get 
              these same very powerful trends. The <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rate itself 
              is accelerating, and roughly doubling every decade. When people 
              claim that we won't see a particular development for a hundred years, 
              or that something is going to take centuries to do accomplish, they're 
              ignoring the inherent acceleration of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> and I were at Harvard some months ago and one Nobel Prize-winning 
              biologist said that we won't see self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              entities for a hundred years. That's actually a good <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, 
              because that's my estimation&amp;#8212at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>&#8212;of 
              how long it will take to achieve that technical milestone. However, 
              since we're doubling the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> every decade, it'll only 
              take 25 calendar years to get there&#8212;this, by the way, is a 
              mainstream opinion in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> field. </p>
<p>The last century is not a good guide to the next, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> 
              that it made only about 20 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, because we were speeding up to this point. At today's 
              rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, we'll make the same amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> as what 
              occurred in the 20th century in 14 years, and then again in 7 years. 
              The 21st century will see, because of the explosive power of exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, something like 20,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at today's rate 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>&amp;#8212a thousand times greater than the 20th century, 
              which was no slouch for radical change.</p>
<p>I've been developing these models for a few decades, and made a 
              lot of predictions about intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the 1980s that 
              people can check out. They weren't perfect, but were a pretty good 
              road map. I've been refining these models. I don't pretend that 
              anybody can see the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> perfectly, but the power of the exponential 
              aspect of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of these technologies, or of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> itself, 
              is undeniable. And that creates a very different perspective about 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>Let's take <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant and shrinkage 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant. Right now, we're shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, apparently 
              both mechanical and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>, at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension 
              per decade. That <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> is also moving slowly, in a double exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, but we'll get to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> at that rate in the 2020s. 
              There are some early-adopter examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> today, but 
              the real mainstream, where the cutting edge of the operating principles 
              are in the multi-nanometer range, will be in the 2020s. If you put 
              these together you get some interesting observations.</p>
<p>Right now we have 10<sup>26</sup> calculations per second in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> in our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brains. We could argue about this 
              figure, but it's basically, for all practical purposes, fixed. I 
              don't know how much <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> it adds if you include <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, 
              but maybe you then get a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> higher than 10<sup>26</sup>. 
              Non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is growing at a double exponential rate, 
              and right now is millions of times less than the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is fixed, because it's 
              an old, mature <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, but the new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is growing exponentially. The crossover 
              will be in the 2020s and after that, at least from a <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> perspective, 
              non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> will dominate at least quantitatively.</p>
<p>This brings up the question of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Lots of people say that 
              even though things are growing exponentially in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, 
              we've made no <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. But we are making <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, even if the doubling factor is much slower. </p>
<h3>Reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a></h3>
<p>The real scenario that I want to address is the reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and the tools 
              we have to observe and understand it are themselves growing exponentially. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">Brain scan</a>ning and mathematical models of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and neural <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              are growing exponentially, and there's very interesting work going 
              on.</p>
<p>There is <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a>, for example, who with his colleagues has 
              collected models of specific types of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and wiring <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              about how the internal connections are <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> in different regions 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. He has put together a detailed model of about 15 regions 
              that deal with auditory processing, and has applied psychoacoustic 
              tests of the model, comparing it to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>. </p>
<p>The model is at least <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably accurate, and this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              is now being used as a front end for speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. 
              Still, we're at the very early stages of understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. It's comparable to the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> project in its early 
              stages in that we also knew very little about the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> in its 
              early stages. We now have most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, but we still don't have 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> to understand how it works.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> only has a few simple 
              ideas and that once we can understand them we can build a very simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. But although there is a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              it's also not vast <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. It is described by a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> that 
              doesn't have that much <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in it. There are about 800 million 
              bytes in the uncompressed <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. We need to consider redundancies 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, as some sequences are repeated hundreds of thousands 
              of times. By applying routine <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> compression, you can compress 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> at a ratio of about 30 to 1, giving you about 23 
              million bytes&#8212;which is smaller than <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word&#8212;to 
              describe the initial conditions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>But the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> has a lot more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> than that. You can argue 
              about the exact <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, but I come up with thousands of trillions 
              of bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to characterize what's in a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which 
              is millions of times greater than what is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>. How can 
              that be? </p>
<p>Marvin talked about how the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> are <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              for understanding how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works. We know from <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> 
              that we can very easily create <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s of considerable <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
              from a small starting condition. You can, with a very small <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, 
              create a <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a> that simulates some simple <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process and create something of far greater <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> than itself. 
              You can use a random function within the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, which ultimately 
              creates not just randomness, but is creating some meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              after the initial random conditions are evolved using a self organizing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>, resulting in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that's far greater than the initial 
              conditions.</p>
<p>That is in large measure how the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> creates the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. We know 
              that it specifies certain <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s for how a particular region 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a>, but within those <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, there's a great 
              deal of <a class="thought" href="entries/stochastic_entry.html">stochastic</a> or random wiring, followed by some kind of process 
              whereby the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> learns and self-organizes to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of its 
              environment. At this point, what began as random becomes meaningful, 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> has multiplied the size of its <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is that, since it's a level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
              we can manage, we will be able to reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              We've shown that we can model <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, clusters of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, and 
              even whole <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions. We are well down that path. It's rather 
              conservative to say that within 25 years we'll have all of the necessary 
              scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> models and will be able to put together 
              a model of the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works. 
              Then, of course, we'll have an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that has some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> like qualities. 
              We'll have to educate and train it, but of course we can speed up 
              that process, since we'll have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to everything that's out in 
              the Web, which will contain all <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is that once you 
              master a process it can operate much faster. So we will learn the 
              secrets of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, partly from reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. This will be one source of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> for creating 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>We can then combine some advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with 
              advantages that we see clearly in non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We 
              spent years training our speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, which gives 
              us a combination of rules. It mixes expert-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> approaches with 
              some self-organizing techniques like neural nets, <a class="thought" href="entries/markov_model_entry.html">Markov model</a>s 
              and other self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s. We automate the training process 
              by recording thousands of hours of speech and annotating it, and 
              it automatically readjusts all its Markov-model levels and other 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s when it makes mistakes. Finally, after years of this 
              process, it does a pretty good job of recognizing speech. Now, if 
              you want your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to do the same thing, you don't have to go 
              through those years of training like we do with every child, you 
              can actually load the evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of this one <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              which is called loading the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s can share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s can do things quickly. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s have a type of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> that's more accurate than our frail 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> memories. Nobody at this table can remember billions of things 
              perfectly accurately and look them up quickly. The combination of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with the benefits 
              of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will be very formidable. Ultimately, 
              this growing non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will have the benefits 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in terms of its <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and our 
              exponentially growing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="thought" href="entries/superintelligence_entry.html">Superintelligence</a> saturates the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a></h3>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, maybe only one part of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a trillion 
              will be <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, but it will be infused with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, which will be able to amplify itself because of the 
              powers of non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to share its <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. How 
              does it grow? Does it grow in or does it grow out? Growing in means 
              using finer and finer granularities of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to do <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, 
              while growing out means using more of the stuff in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Presently, we see some of both. We see mostly the "in," 
              since <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> inherently means that we're shrinking the size 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, making them finer and finer. 
              To some extent we're also expanding out in that even though the 
              chips are more and more powerful, we make more chips every year, 
              and deploy more economic and material resources towards this non 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we'll get to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, which 
              is at the molecular level, infused with the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              and the expanding <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. It'll continue 
              to expand both inwards and outwards. It goes in waves as the expansion 
              inwards reaches certain points of resistance. The <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s 
              will be pretty smooth as we go from the second to the third dimension 
              via molecular computing. At that point it'll be feasible to take 
              the next step into femto <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering&#8212;on the scale of trillionths 
              of a meter&amp;#8212and pico <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering&#8212;on the scale of thousands 
              of trillionths of a meter&#8212;going into the finer <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and manipulating some of the really fine forces, such as 
              strings and quarks. </p>
<p>That's going to be a barrier, however, so the ongoing expansion 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is going to be propelled outward. Nonetheless, 
              it will go both in and out. Ultimately, if you do the math, we will 
              completely saturate our corner of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> and solar 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, sometime in the 22nd century. We'll then want ever-greater 
              horizons, as is the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, and will 
              then expand to the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>How quickly will it expand? One premise is that it will expand 
              at the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, because that's the fastest speed at which 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can travel. There are also tantalizing <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s on 
              quantum disentanglement that show some effect at rates faster than 
              the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, even much faster, perhaps theoretically instantaneously. 
              Interestingly enough, though, this is not the transmission of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              but the transmission of profound quantum randomness, which doesn't 
              accomplish our purpose of communicating <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. You need to 
              transmit <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, not randomness. So far nobody has actually 
              shown true transmission of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> at faster than the speed 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, at least not in a way that has convinced mainstream scientific 
              opinion.</p>
<p>If, in fact, that is a fundamental barrier, and if things that 
              are far away really are far away, which is to say there are no shortcuts 
              through wormholes through the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, then the spread of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              will be slow, governed by the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. This process will 
              be initiated within 200 years. If you do the math, we will be at 
              near saturation of the available <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in and around 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>, based on current understandings of the limitations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, within that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> period. </p>
<p>However, it's my conjecture that by going through these other dimensions 
              that Alan and Paul talked about, there may be shortcuts. It may 
              be very hard to do, but we're talking about supremely intelligent 
              technologies and beings. If there are ways to get to parts of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> through shortcuts such as wormholes, they'll find, deploy, 
              and master them, and get to other parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> faster. 
              Then perhaps we can reach the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, say 10<sup>80</sup>
<a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/lloyd_entry.html">Seth Lloyd</a> estimates 
              represents on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 10<sup>90</sup> bits, without being limited 
              by the apparent speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>.</p>
<p>If the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> is not a limit, and I do have to emphasize 
              that this particular point is a conjecture at this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, then within 
              300 years, we would saturate the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> with our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, 
              and the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> would become supremely intelligent and be 
              able to manipulate everything according to its will. We're currently 
              multiplying <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> by a factor of at least 10<sup>3</sup> 
              every decade. This is conservative, as this rate of exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> is itself growing exponentially. Thus it is conservative 
              to project that within 30 decades (300 years), we would multiply 
              current <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al capacities by a factor of 10<sup>90</sup>, 
              and thus exceed <a class="thought" href="entries/lloyd_entry.html">Seth Lloyd</a>'s estimate of 10<sup>90</sup> bits in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. </p>
<p>We can speculate about <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>&#8212;will this be multiple people 
              or beings, or one being, or will we all be merged?&amp;#8212but nonetheless, 
              we'll be very intelligent and we'll be able to decide whether we 
              want to continue expanding. <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> is very sacred, which is 
              why <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> is a tragedy. Whenever a person dies, you lose all that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a person. The tragedy of losing historical <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s 
              is that we're losing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. We could realize that losing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              is bad, and decide not to do that any more. <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> will have 
              a profound effect on the cosmological destiny of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> at 
              that point.</p>
<h3>Why <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> will fail</h3>
<p>I'll end with a comment about the <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> project. Regardless of this 
              ultimate resolution of this issue of the speed of light&amp;#8212and 
              it is my speculation (and that of others as well) that there are 
              ways to circumvent it&#8212;if there are ways, they'll be found, 
              because <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is intelligent enough to master any mechanism 
              that is discovered. Regardless of that, I think the <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> project 
              will fail&#8212;it's actually a very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant failure, because sometimes 
              a negative finding is just as profound as a positive finding&amp;#8212for 
              the following <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>: we've looked at a lot of the sky with at least 
              some level of power, and we don't see anybody out there. </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> assumption is that even though it's very unlikely that 
              there is another intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> like we have here on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, 
              there are billions of trillions of <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. So even if the probability 
              is one in a million, or one in a billion, there are still going 
              to be millions, or billions, of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-bearing and ultimately <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>-bearing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s out there.</p>
<p>If that's true, they're going to be distributed fairly evenly across 
              cosmological <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, so some will be ahead of us, and some will be 
              behind us. Those that are ahead of us are not going to be ahead 
              of us by only a few years. They're going to be ahead of us by billions 
              of years. But because of the exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, once 
              we get a <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> that gets to our point, or even to the point 
              of Babbage, who was messing around with mechanical linkages in a 
              crude 19th century <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it's only a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of a few centuries 
              before they get to a full realization of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, if not 
              femto and pico-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and totally infuse their area of the 
              cosmos with their <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. It only takes a few hundred years!</p>
<p>So if there are millions of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s that are millions or 
              billions of years ahead of us, there would have to be millions that 
              have passed this threshold and are doing what I've just said, and 
              have really infused their area of the cosmos. Yet we don't see them, 
              nor do we have the slightest indication of their <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>, a challenge 
              known as the Fermi <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>. Someone could say that this "silence 
              of the cosmos" is because the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> is a limit, therefore 
              we don't see them, because even though they're fantastically intelligent, 
              they're outside of our <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> sphere. Of course, if that's true, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> won't find them, because they're outside of our <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> sphere. 
            </p>
<p>But let's say they're inside our <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> sphere, or that <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> isn't 
              a limitation, for the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s I've mentioned. Then perhaps they 
              decided, in their great <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, to remain invisible to us. You can 
              imagine that there's one <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> out there that made that decision, 
              but are we to believe that this is the case for every one of the 
              millions, or billions, of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> says should be 
              out there?</p>
<p>That's unlikely, but even if it's true, <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> still won't find them, 
              because if a <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> like that has made that decision, it is 
              so intelligent they'll be able to carry that out, and remain hidden 
              from us. Maybe they're waiting for us to evolve to that point and 
              then they'll reveal themselves to us. Still, if you analyze this 
              more carefully, it's very unlikely in fact that they're out there.</p>
<p>You might ask, isn't it incredibly unlikely that this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, which 
              is in a very random place in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and one of trillions of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>s, is ahead of the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>? Of course the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, with the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> so sublimely precise to 
              allow this type of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to occur is also very unlikely, but 
              by the anthropic principle, we're here, and by an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous anthropic 
              principle we are here in the lead. After all, if this were not the 
              case, we wouldn't be having this <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>. So by a similar anthropic 
              principle we're able to appreciate this argument. </p>
<p>I'll end on that note.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>To me, the attempt at contrasting the ideas of "dumb forces of cosmology" and "biologiocal intelligence" is misleading. How can intelligence really be anything other than simply an aspect of these dumb forces of cosmology? 
<br>
I prefer to view the "universe" holistically; so that what we refer to as intelligence is merely an inherent attribute of what we mean by "the universe" as it is filtered through perception. Can the moon's orbit around the earth be considered a manifestation of the moon "perceiving" (and therefore "intelligizing") "the mass of the earth? Are we any closer to the "real nature of the universe" by considering that orbital interaction merely a "dumb force" on display, rather than as an example of what it is that makes the universe intelligent? At what level of the micro/macro universe spectrum of perception does an interaction become merely "mechanical" and supposedly thereby unintelligent?
<br>
<br>
That is why I have problem with statement like:
<br>
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Intelligence is, in fact, a powerful force and we can see that its power is going to grow not linearly but exponentially, and will ultimately be powerful enough to change the destiny of the universe."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
<br>
<br>
Teleological implications aside, I would like to know what is it is exactly that the author sees as growing exponentially? Is it the base of perceptual feedback nodes (self-aware entities)that will grow and, perhaps by attaining some critical threshold or other, cause what we now consider intelligence to transcend itself and alter the basic characterisitcs of the perceived universe? 
<br>
<br>
I assert that intelligence transcends itself all the time and that the rate of that transcendence is directly proportional to the rate of expnasion of the universe; both of which may appear to be accelerative, but compared to what?   
<br>
<br>
Thanx for the space.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Thanks Ray for the always thought provoking articles.  I'm a big fan of your insights and I'm very excited about living in a time where we are becoming conscious of the accelerating nature of life and progress.
<br>
<br>
BUT...
<br>
<br>
I think you tend to forget the emotional and irrational nature of people.  For one thing, computation and technology is moving at it's current pace because there is a demand to play cool video games, have nifty cell phones, and drive more efficient engines.  The people in the advertising business will continue to convince us how a new product will enhance happiness in our life and I'm sure we'll continue to buy these products as many of them will be worth the money.
<br>
<br>
I don't see, however, why the hell we would want to go in some of the directions you mentioned.  What would be our motivation to expand at the speed of light (and you say that may not even be fast enough!) with the intention of converting all dumb matter in the universe into our ever growing computer brain?  I think these are fun ideas to play with but I just don't see human beings behind them.  These directions don't help us.  They don't make us feel warm and fuzzy inside.  Sure we have nuclear reactors powering central heating but sometimes its more fun and satisfying to build a fire.  Are humans going to feel more fulfilled pursuing a meshing of technology?  Will we be HAPPY knowing  we are a hundred times more efficient in computation and memory than Bob at the corner store?  We are not data machines
<br>
<br>
The weird thing is, I'm totally into technology.  I just feel like your general underlying idea is that Robots are better than us and that your assumptions about what will happen in the future seems to be taken from the "what would a robot do?" department.  </p></td>

<br>
<br>
I often find that when I propose the idea that "computers" one day might be able to do everything better than us and therefore rendering us useless as biological entities might not be an impossible thing. That these people often think that it is an ideology or wishfull thinking.
<br>
<br>
To me at least, since I can't really speak for Kurzweil, it is not a matter of wanting or fearing but a matter of a transition that is not to fear. The reason most people dont like the idea is because they do not in their minds make the journey that would lead to the singularity. They think about today and then the future, jumping x number of years.
<br>
<br>
But the thing is that things evolve what is unatural today is completely embedded into the culture 5 years after.

I think Thomas Kristian said it best when he said something along the lines of "only awareness matter, that is the biggest jewel that is worth aiming for" (very loosely interpretted sorry Thomas)</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I mostly agree with you but I think you're missing my point.
<br>
<br>
As technology progresses and becomes embedded in our lives we will notice it less and less.  My friends and I stop sometimes and say "We're living in the future. hogh!@" because we realize the advances made in computers and cell phones and technology in general over the last decade.  Some people say that we've already hit "the singularity."  So I know what you mean in terms of these changes coming about and catching us almost by surprise.
<br>
<br>
But Kurzweil's long reaching extrapolations sound really far fetched.  They sound totally unadvantageous to human beings and what we appreciate about humanity.  Yes, I realize that robots and the brains we and they will build for themselves will outperform ours in every way if that's what we really want to do.  Do we?  WE were here first.  I certainly don't feel compelled to use everything I know about science and technology towards engineering a creation that will make feel worthless.  I am sure there a lot of people that would like to because it is an intellectual exercise and just out of curiosity.
<br>
<br>
I also happen to be in an office in Boston at the moment and I live in Cambridge so I understand the type of fast-paced, driven, neurotic mind which is typical of Bostonians in the university/intellectual environment.  I think some of these ideas border on technological wet dreams... they sound WICKED cool and they're really fun to think about but I don't know that the existing powers are just going to step aside and let the machines become superior and take over.
<br>
<br>
Turning all the matter of the moon into a molecular computer?!  WTF?!  I just made that up as an example but what the hell are we going to do with this computational power?   Simulate the entire planet?  Okay, that could really valuable but I don't think humans are going to loose the drive to do things with their lives.  Most people Humans aren't going to be content with letting the machines go figure out everything about the universe and then just report back to us.  We're gonna keep the machines powerful but subservient to us.  We're gonna be the ones calling the shots for most things.  Sure computers can do more things efficiently but who says the most efficient solution is the one implemented ( I should know, I work for the government! :)
<br>
<br>
Computers will never be better than us because "better" is subjective.  I don't care how fast they can add or how much they can remember... they'll still be one of our products and that are bought and sold.
<br>
<br>
Jesus, I'm only 23 and I'm probably sounding so old fashioned.  Maybe I'm totally wrong.  Maybe my kids will be talking about neural implants/memory boosting nano bots/etc and I'll warn them of the moral implications but it will just seem to them like the lastest thing to do.  Hmm...  guess we'll find out!</p></td>

I would like to reccomend at book to you that is really great and will I think give you a sligtly different perspektive of the idea about robots vs. human.
<br>
<br>
Its written by Hans Movrac and is calle "Robot - Mere machine to transcendend mind" and is doing a really good job explaining the human role in this.
<br>
<br>
I think the main point is not really that humans become extinct but that awareness gets a new material to exist within.
<br>
<br>
If you think about the human body as being build by smaller and smaller groups alle the way down to the molecules, you could think of this as the difference between monkeys and humans. We are almost the same but we just have that extra ability. The same thing will happen to "robots"</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;but what the hell are we going to do with this computational power? Simulate the entire planet?
<br>
<br>
With this much computational power, entire new universes could be "simulated" or rather, actually instantiated within the software of this cosmic computer.  This would make the self-aware being that created the internal universe its god/creator.  We may very well be inside of god's "simulation" right now, only to duplicate the process once again.
<br>
<br>
The thing that makes me curious is Hawking's theory of the universe as expanding for a certain amount of time, and then retracting back like the big bang in reverse.  If this happens, then the cosmic computer may get stupider as it gets destroyed.  Or it may bring all of the matter in the universe within reach..
<br>
<br>
A success for the god that created our universe?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I agree with the above post...  I don't see the humanity in pillaging the universe with the singular (heh heh) goal of transforming regular matter into smart matter.  It sounds too much like cancer, albeit smart cancer.
<br>
<br>
The universe is pretty quiet as is, and I like it that way.  I love so many of Kurzweil's ideas, but this idea of intelligence expanding in all directions at the speed of light seems more Borgish than Human.
<br>
<br>
Besides, I'm still left wondering, "what the heck will we be computing, anyway?"  Even today a huge amount of computer processing power is wasted.  And that which is used usually goes to bulky office products and video games.  Even our brain's computation power is usually just computing mundane ideas about personal relationships and pop-culture.
<br>
<br>
My two cents, anyway.</p></td>

Like a Bernard cell, we first organize things, going against the natural tendency for equilibrium, (this is evolution) so as to reach a configuration where we can rush as fast as possible to equilibrium. The important idea here is understanding that we are the universe so what it does is what we want to do. (Our free will is determinism, since we embody the particles that are acting deterministically. What "they" do is what we want to do.)
<br>
<br>
I do, however, agree with people who say that most people do not understand this. So, I see humans (this is already starting) splitting up into those who are enlightened and do bizarre unhuman things like going at the speed of light or whatever, and humans who remain quaint and blissfully ignorant, taking the place of just another lower tier of evolution like animals that don't bother the higher ones at all.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I speak of evolution as a progressing up- as is normal. But I actually believe that the appropriate understanding is that becoming more complex, etc. is a fracturing and a "going down" to achieve the ultimate death of equilibrium, which is the ultimate good as opposed to the conventional view.
<br>
<br>
The most important thing about a mindset such as this is that it can be very dangerous (just like, say, how Nietzsche's ideas have been hijacked by wackos so often). There is a fine line between existentialism/nihilism and enlightenment.
<br>
<br>
Anyone who vehemently hates what I have to say, or anyone who is intrigued, can feel free to email me. It is needless to say that these ideas are very intricate, and are part of a whole subset of a grand worldview, and the full idea cannot be expressed in mere words.
<br>
<br>
Also, probably most importantly, is that taking of things like the meaning of life is such a touchy issue that everyone who reads this will misinterpret it. Instead of assuming your interpretation of something, ask if it is what I really meant before you assume it.</p></td>

You assumption fails to take into account that 'life' is always the process of de-equilibrium with the rest of the universe. i.e. an organizing or the locality. If this continues, then I can imagine a universe that has very large complexity punctuated by small pockets of chaos.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I can't help but think, "Woah, woah... slow down" when I read about your absolute confidence in THE definitive meaning of life.
<br>
<br>
The truth to your words don't seem so immediately obvious to me.  Isn't the equilibrium state of the universe 2 degrees Kelvin?  Sounds cold to me. :)
<br>
<br>
I think this idea of us being part of the universe and really looking at our species as something that was supposed to happen is really interesting and it appeals to me on a spiritual level as well.  Human beings are just as integral to the universe as the stars and nebulae.  
<br>
<br>
But I think it's stretching it to say that what the universe does is neccesarily what we want it to do.  The universe doesn't give a damn about us obviously and the point is that it was doing it's thing long before we were around.  We ARE the universe in that we were created within in it so there are many things which seems to be the way we want them to be.  But humans are SO fragile... most of the universe is totally inhospitable to us.  That's another reason I have trouble connecting the purpose of life with a mission involving the whole universe.  It's an interesting idea though... I think you're suggesting that this purpose is not neccesarily known by most but it really is the direction that we're all moving.
<br>
<br>
Have the seen the movie, "Waking Life."?  There's a scene in this movie where they talk about how we're controlled, deterministically by the physics of the particles that we're made of.  I'm not totally sold on this one either... I wonder if matter arranged into structures like the brain can rise above it's parts and truly create free will.  That's a pretty big question that I don't think has been answered.
<br>
<br>
And yes, I think a division between people that are content and people that still want to move forward has already started... if not in this very forum!  But the difference with this new technological evolution and the reason I'm sympathetic with people that want to remain "human" is that the evoltuion is unnecessary.  Not understanding people that don't want cybernetic implants and don't want to make there life any faster, hectic, and restless is like not understanding deers that don't want to grow rocketlaunchers out of their backs.  They already have reached an equilibrium with their environment.  Maybe that's just your point... since we're smart the entire universe is "our environment" and ultimately our mission is to make it all feel like home.  Hmmm.....
<br>
<br>
Do you appreciate art and music?  Does it sadden you about a future of us becoming Borgs?  I don't know if this will make us happy.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Here's my theory for what it's worth:
<br>
Humans have evolved from a signal that has been transmitted here from another planet.  This signal has the code and fundamental formulas for the building blocks of all life here on earth.  It has been transmitted out in a random fashion, by an intelligent being like ourselves who have evolved to the state where they have created the 'formula' for the building blocks of life, and now must spread this formula to continue the spread of their species. How else are you going to find a hospitable planet for humans unless you figure out the formula for all life on our planet, then beam this signal out as fast as possible in as many directions as possible with the 'code' so that suitable planets can take the code, run with it, and end up where we are now?  Eventually, we will end advancing enough here on earth to create this code, and send it out ourselves.  Because ultimately, the creation of life and the evolution of life forms has to be looked at on the large scale - billions of years to get there, find the right conditions, and then to evolve to the point where the cycle can continue, to send the 'code' out again to keep life spreading throughout the universe.  In this scenario, there could be millions of life forms out there.  Would they be sending a signal that SETI is looking for?  Not likely.  If they are far enough along, they are sending a signal that contains the code for building life, we've already received it, and we're working our way towards the same solution.  And it isn't a quick solution, because the solution is code which contains the formula to create life to create a species that can take the formula and physical environment to recreating and sending it out again.  This completely ties in with 'scanning' a human brain and reproducing it digitally, but what ultimately we should be looking to do is to create the code/formula for life that can be transmitted to another planet to continue our species.  Isn't that what we do on this planet anyway??? </p></td>

Nice theory, but it either suggests an infinite regress, or there was a species somewhere that evolved from "random chemistry" to intelligent beings, and NOT from receiving any signal/code telling the atoms how to behave (as it were).
<br>
<br>
And if there was a literal "intelligent life-instructions" signal being broadcast, what on earth (heh) would receive such a signal and be able to act upon it?  That would be one amazing signal, if it could cause atoms to rearrange themselves remotely!
<br>
<br>
Perhaps that "signal" is just the nature of atoms themselves, formed identically everywhere.  When they happen to aggregate in areas conducive to the development of life, life tends to develop, and eventually beings evolve who wonder "how fortunate to have evolved in a place conducive to life".

<br>
<br>
Do you fall into a dyanmic equilibrium, with intelligence constantly chugging away, yet contricted within the bounds of the system?  And that we stay that way until the end of time?
<br>
<br>
For some reason that seems ludicrous to me.  
<br>
<br>
The beauty of intelligence is to question.  The desire and the force to know.  But not only to know, but to experience, to live (as the poets say).
<br>
<br>
Yet how can we live, how can we experience, how can we know, once we reach the boundaries of the system.  How can we reconcile existence (or live) once everything is known.  Won't we be dead then?  Won't intelligence die, in that moment of true epiphany?
<br>
<br>
I suppose you could argue that we will break the boundary of the universe itself, and flood out into a multiverse...or whatever is out there.
<br>
<br>
It would be terribly ironic if there was merely an infinite nothinginess, and voided our existence in a heartbeat.  How humans killed the universe...

But hey were going somewhere...and i'll enjoy the ride while it lasts.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>There is something that really bothers me about Kurzweil's projection.
<br>
<br>
Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Kurzweil's most extravagant supposition happened to be correct and it is ultimately possible for an intelligence to expand into the greatest depth and breadth of the universe. Suppose that it is also possible for it to establish instantaneous communication and transportation between every sector. Perhaps, it could even go outside the boundaries of the known universe and begin to manipulate time and space. 
<br>
<br>
We would have an intelligence that spans the extant universe, can manipulate matter at the most fundamental level, and can effectively be anywhere at any time instantaneously. Since humans are conscious, there is no reason to presume that this massive intelligence could not also be conscious'with all the attributes associated with consciousness. We are indeed referring to 'intelligence' as a fundamental force on the scale of every other force in the universe and effectively exceeding them. 
<br>
<br>
Again, for the sake of argument, suppose that the generally held assumption that any one intelligence is unlikely to be first on the scene is also correct. Is it not plausible, even probable, that such a phenomenon had already occurred?  
<br>
<br>
Now, suppose I approached Kurzweil, or any other proponents of such reasoning, and said that I believed there to already be a conscious intelligence that is a fundamental force in the universe, that can be anywhere at any time, and that can manipulate the forces of the universe at the most fundamental level. Would he or any of the other proponents of this idea take me seriously? If they did happen to take me seriously, would they not quickly turn if I gave this intelligence a name?

But Thomas, I didn't even give it a name?

What is it that we see? Our assumption is that this little bubble of space that began with a Big Bang is the one, only, and first such bubble to appear in the cosmos. Maybe other bubbles of various sorts have already appeared. If Wolfram's ideas about complexity are even partly correct, it is not unreasonable to suppose that one of these bubbles went the same way as our own. 
<br>
<br>
Now, suppose that the proprietors of this previous bubble learned how to go beyond the boundaries of their known bubble and manipulate time and space. Might they not have become proficient at manipulating the evolution of other such bubbles? Could ours possibly be a tailor made bubble? 
<br>
<br>
Once, when I was playing poker with some friends, I was dealt a royal flush. I knew that these friends were all very well acquainted. Based only on the weight of the probabilities, I guessed that the deck had been stacked, said, 'Nice try guys!' and folded. I knew from their expressions that I had been correct. 
<br>
<br>
Haven't you noticed something suspicious about the whole construction of our universe and the way it has unfolded? I seem to recall a line form Albert Einstein: 'The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.' Think about it!
<br>
<br>
As for what we see, how could we possibly guess the agenda of proficient bubble makers? Maybe they just like to blow bubbles! Why pop a pretty bubble?
<br>
<br>
&gt;How probable is it, that somebody equally smart as you, has written this post before?
<br>
<br>
Actually, my post is nearly a plagiarism of something that someone else posted to another article. Something I have learned while perusing the Internet is that it is almost impossible to come up with an original idea.  Do you know how I came across this site? I had an idea of something like the 'Singularity', but I called it 'Threshold Technology'. I suspected that someone had thought of it before, so I started punching things into Google until I found the essay by Vernor Vinge. That ultimately led me to this site. 
<br>
<br>
From the standpoint of scientific objectivity, I agree with your assumption that no such phenomenon has already occurred. I just don't think it happens to be true.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>But maybe aliens, or something like aliens, HAVE already come here and effectively taken over. How could we be sure if we had never seen the universe without them? Maybe the natural universe is nothing like the one we perceive around us. Maybe this is a synthetic universe. Perhaps the reason why photons do not decide what to be until someone observes them is that they are actually very small, very sophisticated automatons. The intelligence of the universe could be running on a bandwidth so narrow that we cannot discern it.
<br>
<br>
My point is that there is a smooth gradient from the idea that someone else has probably done the things Kurzweil has described to the idea that the whole universe is already running on an intelligent platform. There is a smooth gradient from the idea that aliens have merely taken over the known universe to the idea that something even stranger has been around since the dawn of time and nothing has ever happened without its intervention. 
<br>
<br>
Reasonable extrapolation puts us far enough along the gradient to be sure that the gradient reaches fairly high. Is it more likely that the universe is already somewhere on that gradient, or is it more likely that we are the very first? Is there anything to tip the scale in favor of one conclusion or the other?
<br>
<br>
Like I said before, there is something very suspicious about our universe. Actually, there is something very suspicious about our history. I'm not referring to anything obvious like irreducible complexity or the unlikelihood of the weak nuclear force being such that it permits fusion in stars. I'm not even referring to the unlikelihood of our earth having a stabilizing moon. I would expect some intelligent life in the universe to eventually be provided the right circumstances to arrive at the point that we have arrived at. It just seems like it has happened too 'smoothly'. 
<br>
<br>
Have you ever played a video game where the scenarios kept getting harder, but always in a very gradual and continuous fashion? Most video games are designed that way on purpose. Most textbooks are designed that way also. Not only is the universe comprehensible, it is also comprehensible on a remarkably smooth curve that has allowed our technology and our social structure to advance at a continuous pace. It seems like the universe has been set up more like an interactive education machine than like a device designed for function alone. If a primitive person tried to understand a calculator, they would have no starting point. That is the way things designed entirely for function tend to be. Our universe seems to be like a big interactive puzzle'one designed to be figured out.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I can understand your qualms about an intelligent universe that may already be around us, but I hold the belief that intensely complex sytems (ie the universe) can develop in a such a way that seems very "smooth" as you put it.  Because of the intense interconnection, and varying forces that compose our universe, these systems can form, and interact.  You can also explain your "smoothness" paradox by realizing that complex systems since the beginning of our universe have been slowly gaining momentum.  Whether that momentum is expanding outwards, or with evolution, which generally favors more complex organisms.  Like a boulder rolling down a hill all of these systems are going towards something.  Whether this something is RK's "intelligent universe" is yet to be determined.  But when something has momentum it has direction, and when something has direction, it creates the illusion that there is an "intelligent purpose" to the universe.  As you put it, the universe appears to be an interactive learning machine and we were meant to figure it out.  I believe that this is a by-product of a natural momentum that is carrying us along and we were created because of this momentum towards something.  The important thing to realize is that a momentum does not require an intelligent force to initiate.  It can start by itself and end by itself.

<br>
<br>
Yes, I agree that their 'development' would seem very smooth. But would the 'discovery' of that development necessarily be smooth? Recall that we did not begin trying to discover the development of the universe until it had evolved systems as complex as ourselves. Could it not have happened that by the time we came onto the scene the development of the universe had become completely opaque? On the other hand, could it not have happened that the development of the universe would have remained more or less opaque until at some moment in our history we accidentally discovered the last page of the book and effectively ruined the story? Think about it: Aristotle, Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Michaelson, Hawking'. Why couldn't Newton have been right and that have been the end of the book? Of course, we all know that for logical reasons Newton could not have been right, but that is in this version of the universe. Did the universe have to be this way?
<br>
<br>
This is nothing like an argument. It's just 'suspicious'. It raises enough suspicion that, combined with the observation that a universal intelligence is virtually inevitable, it lends weight to the idea that this intelligence may already exist. 
<br>
<br>
Here is another observation. Consciousness'a debatable phenomenon'does not seem to be necessary to the structure of the universe. Why would atoms need something like consciousness in order to smash into one another and bond in their various ways? However, an anthropic principle suggests that if consciousness did not exist in our universe, we would not be aware of it to refute it. However, I suspect that consciousness is such an unlikely phenomenon in any universe, that many tries at it would be required before a universe 'popped out' that supported it. This suggests that ours is not the only universe. Moreover, the idea that our 'Big Bang' is the only big bang that has ever occurred is not unlike the once held belief that our world is the center of the universe. Can any of us think of a single precedent of anything in the universe of which there is exactly one? I strongly contend that ours is not the only universe in existence. This expands the probability of us not being the first on the scene by many times. 
<br>
<br>
None of this amounts to anything like an argument. Science has become so comfortable with the idea that an omnipotent and omniscient intelligence is improbable; I'm just not sure how well it is taking to the idea that it is inevitable?</p></td>

A very good advice! It was never meant, that Special Relativity holds, anyway. Except in books and lectures for uneducated folk. And maybe for a leather (science) to climb.

The deep questions, like - are we inside a simulation? - are of this kind. Better to wait for a paradigm shift. And see how it was never a problem, really.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Scott,
<br>
<br>
I can't flatly deny that the universe is intelligent... but if it were, the question remains as to the (original) source of such intelligence.
<br>
<br>
If the obsevable universe-as-we-know-it were actually a simulation, the "simulator(s) would certainly appear "supernatural" to us, but unless we really intend for a (classically) supernatural force to exist, we must admit that even these "simulators" are themselves either "ordinary, bound by (some kind of) physics type beings", or they are themselves simulations run by a further-back set of simulators...
<br>
<br>
That is to say, at some point, a "real-ground" would be reached, and the "first-simulators" posited to exist.  Those beings, and the "real-physik" universe they inhabit, would be one in which "intelligence" arose "naturally" from unthinking background forces, gradually, and haphazardly I would assume.
<br>
<br>
I am always suspicious of appeals to a "multiverse", (being an ensemble of universes that are by definition unreachable but theoreticlly posited to exist in order to make some calculations work better.)  If they could be "reached", they would no longer be "multiverse", but just a revamp of our definition of universe.  And how many such "ensembles" could there be?  Only one, by definition.  Call it "the totality" if you like.
<br>
<br>
There can be only one "everything". :)
<br>
<br>
The Multiverse completely sidesteps the issue of an understandable universe (or one in which consciousness exists).  If trillions of universe are formed, and 99.99999% of them are life-hostile (no intelligence arises) then in that 0.00001% where intelligence does arise, beings develope who will eventually say "how curious that the universe has exactly the right proportion of forces to allow life and consciousness to arise.  Must be an intelligence at work ..."
<br>
<br>
Finally, I think the "smooth understandibility" of the universe is actually a misrepresentation, induced by the fact that history books try to make history understandable.  We (scientists, historians, etc.) are in the business of explaining things to make them understandable.  So, whether we are "on track", or merely creating a facsimili of reality that happens to "map well" to observations, our explanations always tend to be "understandable", by design.
<br>

There is a reason why we say mathematical theorems are discovered and that is because no particular knower of a theorem is needed for the theorem to be true, the truth of a theorem is completely contained in the axioms and formal rules of the system.
<br>
<br>
When you run a cellular automata with the same rules and the same starting state you get the same nth state. Do the same thing with Physics and the starting conditions of the universe, Does there need to be an instance for the nth year's state to be determined ?
<br>
<br>
Now I've conveyed the easy stuff onto the more wacky consequences.
<br>
<br>
Which set of mathematical axioms do we inhabit ? 
<br>
Well the possible collections of axioms and formla rules is infinite. Call the set of all collections of axioms M. A particular universe U would result from more than one element from M as some axioms will be equivalent, some axioms will generate similations of universes constructed from other axioms, So a particular universe will result from an infinite subset of M. Some of the elements of M would be very inefficient generators of U, with highly redundant axioms like "there is an orange at coordinates (0,0,0), a table at (10,5,3)... There would also be more parsimonius elements of M, those with fewer axioms, the laws of Physics would be one element of M. I think that the more parsimonius elements would be more numerous (though all types have a measure of infinity), and therefore we are more likely to unhabit a parsimonious universe.

<br>
<br>
I would rephrase your program as "How to Model a Universe in 4 Easy Steps".
<br>
<br>
For the sake of argument, consider an alternative universe, a lot like ours, except no intelligent (or even sentient) life happens to exist.  In such a universe, are there "perfect circles"?  (planar objects of constant radius whose circumference is 2*Pi*radius)?  Says who?
<br>
<br>
Are there two of some things, and three of others?  Do atoms have mass?  Are some heavier than others?  Says who?
<br>
<br>
Mathematics is a conceptual view, constructed in the intellectual mind.  Yes, once you have "chosen" (invented) a nice set of Axioms, all that follows regarding their interrelationships are "discovered".  But that is NOT the same as saying those theorems "existed independent of the invention of the concepts".
<br>
<br>
One can apply mathematics, and axiomatization, to the game of chess, and prove theorems to be true about chess (whether a particular arrangement of pieces is "winnable" for one side or the other, forinstance.)  But it makes no sense to say that theorems about chess (even those not yet formulated) are, or are not true, BEFORE the game of chess was invented.
<br>
<br>
Mathematics is like chess.  You invent rules, and then investigate the consequences of your invention.  The universe cannot "begin" with mathematics.  However, most reasonable descriptions of the universe begin with mathematics.
<br>
<br>
And out of pure efficiency and pragmatism, we seek the most parsimonious descriptions.
<br>
<br>

Mathematics is inherently metaphorical. Let's say you have 5, but 5 of what (metonymic, isn't it)? If you ADD, what does that actually entail?

<br>
We do not "perceive" reality. Our perceptions are filtered both by the limits of our bodily sensors and our nervous systems and brain-resident ideas.
<br>

In order to say that two objects are "the same" you must ignore small (and often, not so small) differences between them.
<br>

Alice's Wonderland.

<br>
&gt; I believe that you will fail because you cannot reason about such a thing. 
<br>
<br>
It's just a concept. Just like Pi is the concept of the ratio of diameter to circumference, and e derives from the concept of a curve whose value at any point is it's slope at that point, and the angle-concept of imaginary numbers derive from the concept that the negative numbers are a diametrical rotation of the positive numbers, and the golden-ratio, the gravitational constant, etc. 
<br>
<br>
There's a recent new conceptualization: called Omega (though other mathematical concepts have the same name), it is the most inner of surreal numbers, and thus is maximally numerically incalculable.
<br>
<br>
These are all defined conceptually (like much of geometry), the numerical value is a result, not a cause.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Hence I believe that logic is necessarily so and all the consequences, all the theorems, interalations, that arise are also necessarily 
<br>
so.
<br>
<br>
It all depends on WHICH logic you decide to use. Modal? Predicate? Linear?

<br>
&gt; "Answer this then: How would you know the difference ? If you were a self-aware series of states in a cellular automata, the observable result of which (i.e. the functional relations of series of states in the cellular automata) was the same as Physics how would you know ?"
<br>
<br>
Let me try to understand your question(s), as best I understand it/them.
<br>
<br>
A (classic?) cellular automata (CA) is a deterministic state machine, and (according to QM) our universe seems evermore impossible to describe as a deterministic system.  Where it might contain deterministic subsystems (such as Conway's game of "Life"), it is unknown whether such CA-type systems can become self-aware.  But let us suppose that it could, that the universe (as we experience it) were a CA, (running on something, somewhere), and that I was a manifestation of this CA.  I then observe the behavior of this "universe" (derivative of the state transitions), and I might formulate what I think are the "rules", and formulate such conjectured rules in a language I invent and call "mathematics".
<br>
<br>
Until I make those observations, and codify what I think are the "rules of behavior" in my mathematics language, there is no mathematics.  And the "universal CA" certainly needs no expressible mathematics language in order to proceed from state to state.  Only our description of it needs such a language.
<br>
<br>
A falling apple does not need to calculate its mass, mass of the earth, distance between their centers, and apply the inverse-square force law in order to fall with a certain acceleration.  If the universe were a CA, it would simply be in the nature of the state transitions that the apple accelerates and falls to earth.  The "inverse square law" (a mathematical abstraction) would simply be a way to generalize the behavior, NOT knowing the universe was a CA and all motion was due to CA state transitions.
<br>
<br>
But if the universe were really such a CA, then pick any one of its simplest "cells", and ask "what state might it be in, at any given moment, and what would materially distinguish that state from another state it might assume later?"  Is it an electron spin that is either up or down?  CAN'T BE, since electrons as (we assume) manifestations of the universal state machine.  Quarks?  Gluons?  Every CA I can think of, except as a pure abstract mental concept, is manifest in some material substance for which at least some physical characteristic distinguishes cell-state-X from cell-state-Y.
<br>
<br>
Thus, to conjecture the universe as a giant CA is to avoid, from the start, the investigation of the fundamental physics of the universe, which would be the "real-physik" upon which the CA were operating.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; "Question two: Provide me with something else other than mathematics which is Necessarily so, i.e. something that can be potent enough to be unavoidably existent."
<br>
<br>
Why do you feel that there must be anything that is "Necessarily So"?  Do you think the universe cares that we have invented a system of logic, wherein "statements" can be assigned Truth, Falsity, Consistency or Inconsistency?
<br>
<br>
I don't believe there is such a thing as a "true assertion" as far as the universe is concerned.  However, if we create systems of "concepts", and "logic rules" for relating concepts to other concepts, we can demand that assertions made about these concepts are either True or False (or Undecidable) with respect to the concept-system in question.  In the universe of "chess concepts", the statement "My pawn can take your rook" is false if your rook is aside my pawn, rather than diagonal to it, etc.
<br>
<br>
There are (thus) things that are Necessarily So about chess, since it is definitively a construct of rules.  There is no proof that the universe is a construct of rules, only that we can invent rules that tend to match universal behaviors.
<br>
<br>
If we decide to describe the universe in terms of positions, velocities, masses, forces, etc, then "energy" is a "Necessarily So" fundamental quality.  But all of these terms are really mathematical inventions that we "assign" to qualities of observation.  If we decide to describe the universe in some completely different way, there may be nothing that corresponds to the "energy" concept, or at least, not fundamentally so.
<br>
<br>
But however we try to formulate concepts that "map well" to the observable universe, we run into increasingly unusual problems.  On the one hand, if we want all of our "true concept statements" to be self-consistent, they tend to diverge from real observations.  On the other hand, if we try to make them always match observations, they tend to become inconsistent.
<br>
<br>
There is no "rule" the universe must follow that says, "you must behave in such a manner that some system of true-false statements is sufficient to completely describe you."
<br>
<br>
There is no rule that says "the universe MUST be amenable to some axiomatization".  Rather, WE impose that rule on OUR descriptions of the universe, because WE abhor inconsistency.  The universe does not care about the rules we make to describe it.

I agree with you that were we extended states in a CA we would not observe atomic CA states directly, that would requiring stepping out of the universe. Similary were we 'functional interelations in mathematics' we would not observe the mathematics, just the interelations, for the same reason.

I think I'll come to a conclusion here. The essential differance between our positions, the difference from which all our other disagreements stem is that you regard mathematics as a human construct, whilst I regard it as an unavoidable aspect of existence, C'est la vie.

&gt; "The essential differance between our positions, the difference from which all our other disagreements stem is that you regard mathematics as a human construct, whilst I regard it as an unavoidable aspect of existence"
<br>
<br>
Well, not so much a human construct, as a construct of conceptualization (for which on earth, I assume, only humans are capable.)
<br>
<br>
In mathematics, we can formally distinguish infinite sets that can be "mated" to the counting numbers, and infinite sets (such as the "reals") that cannot be given any such correspondence, and are thus definitively "greater" infinities (in terms of set cardinality.)
<br>
<br>
We do not know whether the universe is, or is not actually infinite, but for the sake of argument, let us suppose that it is finite (huge, but finite).  Then there is no reason for transfinite numbers to be an "unavoidable aspect of existence", in the sense that the universe needs to entertain such notions in order to operate itself, to "exist", etc.  And yet, we can play the numbers concepts against one another to produce all manner of conjecturable sets, including various transfinite sets.  In what sense could these relationships among transfinite sets be said "exist" as part of the universe, before anyone of sentience exists to consider numbers in the first place?
<br>
<br>
It is tempting, when we consider the seemingly inescapable "truths" of mathematics, to imply from their apparent universality that these truths "exist", whether or not there are conscious entities to "discover" them.  But when you examine the very foundations at a deeper level, you always find that every such system of mathematical logic is based upon a handful of premises (axioms) that are simply "given to be true", and it is really the consequences of those premises that are being "discovered".
<br>
<br>
Although the universe reveals a great deal of observable self-consistency, there is no a-priori reason to hold that the universe must be self-consistent (as measured by any assignments to statements in a system of predicate logic, for instance).  Consequently, if we demand that our conceptual formulations about the universe be free from contradiction, it is possible that every such formulation will fail to capture the universe with complete accuracy.
<br>
<br>
And yet, try we must, for in the rational framework of explications, that is the only game in towm.  
<br>

That's a good point. I'm not certain that it is true, but it is a good point. 
<br>
<br>
I can see that I am not convincing anyone. That's just as well, because I doubt we are getting out of the game any time soon. 
<br>
<br>
When Kurzweil finishes his new book written specifically about the singularity we may see a storm of misinterpretations, reinterpretations, and misinformed counter arguments. People aren't very good at waiting to see what happens: this debate could get really hot. 
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, as others have observed, not very many people are prepared to deal with these ideas. I've directed numerous people to Vinge's essay, and I am surprised at how little of it they understand. Everyone tries to interpret it in terms of historical precedents. Sadly, people throughout history have cried 'wolf' so many times that when something like this comes along, everyone is set to dismiss it. 
<br>
<br>
I keep running into people that say things like: 'Computers have run their course.' and, 'Technology is about to reach a plateau.' I can't make up my mind as to which is the best approach. Does the situation call for more general scientific education, education directly about the singularity, or a hard sell? Maybe a movie really would be a good idea. Maybe even a miniseries comparable to 'Taken'.

I think a good movie would be best (if done well.)  Few other methods will "awaken" the general populace to the issues, the "forces" at work, and separate the inevitable from the purely hypothetical.
<br>
<br>
How to do that, AND make it a good story ... I'd choose James Cameron over Steven Speilberg.  It needs to be technical, yet high impact.
<br>

That would be my choice, anyway.  Story ideas?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>My idea is that the story would feature a regular family over the period from 1980 to 2030. It would show them going through the usual trials of life, but the emphasis would be on dealing with technological changes'things like being laid off from a job and finding that they need to gain all sorts of technical knowledge to get rehired. Have I mentioned that I teach at a technical college? I've seen more than my share of the heartache from that particular phenomenon. 
<br>
<br>
As the families story progresses, their world would get stranger and stranger until it begins to be almost impossible to cope. The realism would be maintained by introducing new changes one at a time and dealing with them as they come up. Finally, they would wake up one morning and find that the world they went to bed in has been completely replaced. Here is where some real imagination could come in. It would be sort of like when Dorothy was swept up by the tornado and dropped in the Land of Oz. 
<br>
<br>
Honestly, I think the story would write itself. The key would be to stick close to the facts and the most plausible projections made by the most technically proficient futurists. I don't have the technical versatility to write it, but someone out there must? However, I think it should be a miniseries, because to do the story justice, it must advance very gradually.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Some thirty years ago, I speculated that mankind would be "superceded" by artificial intelligence. I reasoned that it would have more durability and expandability and thus ultimately
<br>
succeed the state of the art "Human".  
<br>
<br>
However, no one I ever had discussions with could
<br>
believe that "we" would allow this to happen. And it was a great conversation stopper; even most "computer" people told me there would always
<br>
have to be some one to "turn the machine on"!!
<br>
<br>
So I felt a little like Rip Van Winkle when I first heard of Ray Kurzweil's book "Age of Spiritual Machines" in early 1999. It kind of blew my mind. I had always presumed that these were far into the future ideas, not to worry about, only to speculate on.  Now  here was someone with extreme technical accomplishments AND a profound vision of the possibilites of the future, and the future was only 30-40 years away.
<br>
<br>
Not that his views will turn out to be the ones
<br>
to unfold in the future, but he has caused many of us to take the possibilities seriously, and to address the what if's.  I personally now discuss these ideas with young people whenever I
<br>
can, advising them that it will be their input that will determine the "morality" of future intelligence.  We must  procreate "responsible" Intelligence, not shrink in fear of the unknown. 
<br>
<br>
Kurzweil wrote in a recent article that he was"amazed" how few people understood the implications of the rapidly changing technology.
<br>
That statement indicates how much needs to be done to educate most of us. Medical advances amaze us and cause moral controversery, but those problems will be overwhelmed by the moral issues of intelligence.
<br>
<br>
Diversity is a universal safeguard, and its even
<br>
more important in this higher speed  Intelligence evolution. It is incumbant on those of us who grasp the possibilites, good and bad, to spread the discussion. Its our childrens future.
<br>
<br>
As to where it all ends, who can possibly know. But the ride has been great so far and continues.......and I appreciate being a "human" more than ever................................</p></td>

Honestly, I hate to even contemplate it. It reminds me of a dream I used to have as a child where something unimaginably massive was chasing after me and I could never get away from it. This is that dream incarnate. If people are blowing up buildings because they do not like Western culture, imagine what they will do when they see what's coming. We may as well start printing 666's on everything that is manufactured just to get people past the obvious. 
<br>
<br>
This is, after all, a social problem. Many people think of the singularity as a technological issue, but it is really a social issue. What happens when everyone in the world realizes that we are on a roller coaster ride to infinity and nobody can get off? The realization of it will not come to most people until we are in the last stages. Most of the people I know won't get it until it is practically on top of them'with perhaps two or three years to spare at the most. The vast majority of the world won't get it until it gets them. 
<br>
<br>
Any ideas are welcome!

<br>
<br>
For example, in the series "Foundation" by Isaac Asimov there was a character, "The Mule," who had the power to pyschologically control mass groups of people, and he came into a society that was advancing exponentially technologically and completely controlled it.  He would be similar to an extremely powerful AI in our future.

This is Bill Joy's warning...that we should stop all nanotech research now, and wait until we understand more fully the consequences of what we are doing.  I believe there is some truth in that.

Our current social structures could not withstand the impact of a singularity.  The problem is that to fully educate and foster a greater understanding of the implications of the singularity would require a complete overturn of most political and power structures.

<br>
<br>
I can't make up my mind about that. The problem is that our social structure is dissolving in an acid bath of cultural experimentation, scientific progress, and technological innovation. Just the other day, I ran into a magazine article called 'Designer God'. The subject was how people are creating their own mix-and-match religions. Do we still have a social structure? The issues are already getting so jumbled that it's hard to know where to start sorting things out. 
<br>
<br>
People are less resistant when they have less social cohesion. That could be a bonus. On the other hand, people are more easily frightened when they are not part of a well-defined group. That fear will certainly stand against us. 
<br>
<br>
And what will be the repercussions of all this fear and lack of cohesion? Did you know that in his essay 'Why the Future doesn't Need Us' Bill Joy cites Theodore Bundy? Are we going to see a lot more Theodore Bundys? One time, as an experiment, I went around to the people where I work and told them that the subject of Jerry Springer that day was 'Fathers that are sleeping with their daughters and want to break up'. Most of them were a little miffed, but none of them doubted me. Are we going to see people that have absolutely no sense of what is reasonable? 
<br>
<br>
The thing is, we could slide into the post-singularity world without a hitch. It could be just like showing up for Thanksgiving dinner at grandma's house. We might all find ourselves in the most wonderful world imaginable, and without the vast majority of us having to lift a finger to bring it about. 
<br>
<br>
Or, we could all be fuel.

I think the oposite would be true. Fear, esspecially fear of the unknown, grows rapidly in groups of people with similar beliefs. As an individual, all desicions on how to react to a situation can only depend on one point of view, either discounting or reinforcing previous fears. fear in a group spreads faster and gets reinforced by others much easier. mob mentallity as it were.

<br>
It is important to change the social structure, and to hear that it is moving in that direction gives me a little more hope. One thing we need less of, is large groups going out and destroying something they don't understand for the simple reason that they don't understand it (angry mobs destroying things they have intimate knowledge of and good reason to, that can still have a positive purpose). The frankenstein monster might never had gone on a wild rampage if an angry mob hadn't come after it with torches, intent on killing it. ( I hope that wasn't just a holywood added scene, I'll admit up front I haven't read the original book. But the message behind the scene still stands whoever created it.)

The clear pattern I see is that communication increases confidence. I can relate to that. Ten years ago, I thought I was the only one thinking about many of these things, and it worried me. Now I realize that not only are others thinking about them, many have studied them in depth. 
<br>
<br>
The key is the Internet. We need to get everyone online! Not just online, but online with high speed connections like DSL or cable so that they will never hesitate to investigate an idea.

I'm not sure I see the connection.

<br>
A "universal truth machine" would be able to answer the question, "Are there infinitely many prime pairs (29,31), (71,73) ?", (the question having been suitably codified).
<br>
<br>
Goedel demonstrated that in any sufficiently expressive system of knowledge (such as the predicate mathematical logic), there will always exist "true statements" about the system that cannot be established as true within the system.  So a "universal truth machine" is impossible.
<br>
<br>
But that does not preclude the universe from being permiated with intelligence, whether "our" intelligence, or simply being a giant intelligence all its own.
<br>
<br>
It can be a "universal intelligence", and yet still not know whether there are infinitely many prime pairs, for instance.
<br>
<br>
A universal intelligence need not know the answers to all questions.

You are right about that.  In a universe of finite elements (and thus, finite interrelationships) all questions of "real state" can be answered by exhaustive analysis.
<br>
<br>
Still, not all questions can be answered.  Even a universe of only 10^100 particles can give rise to intelligent beings who can define the set of "all integers", the set of "all prime numbers", and pose well-formed conjectures about them that may well be unanswerable.

A finite universe is not limited to only conjectures about finite sets.

No, in fact you need only a finite chunk of mathematics. Not "the whole thing".
<br>
<br>
Instead of mathematics, one could study the finite set, of all possible (human) brain states.
<br>
<br>
Or even the _finite_ set of all possible clouds of particles. It's not THAT huge, at all! About 2^(10^90). Inside that number, every conceivable infinite set is accounted for.
<br>
<br>
I find the isomorphism between the finite set of all possible clouds of particles up to the size of Universe on one - and the transfinite mathematics on the other side, a very important anchor, to the finite reality.

Those infinite games ... are they any better then the game of chess? Aren't they even more useless?

&gt; "No, in fact you need only a finite chunk of mathematics. Not "the whole thing"."
<br>
<br>
True, if you will only apply the math to the study of a finite universe (the calculus would be difficult to develop in only finite terms, however.  Approximations approach the exact theoretical values only through the taking of infinite limits.)
<br>
<br>
&gt; "Instead of mathematics, one could study the finite set, of all possible (human) brain states."
<br>
<br>
(Why only human ones? :)
<br>
<br>
&gt; "Or even the _finite_ set of all possible clouds of particles. It's not THAT huge, at all! About 2^(10^90). Inside that number, every conceivable infinite set is accounted for."
<br>
<br>
I assume you mean "every conceivable FINITE subset of the cloud, assuming the cloud is itself finite.
<br>
<br>
&gt; "I find the isomorphism between the finite set of all possible clouds of particles up to the size of Universe on one - and the transfinite mathematics on the other side, a very important anchor, to the finite reality."
<br>
<br>
We don't know if "reality" is, or is not finite (or even by which measure it might make sense to call it infinite or finite.)  Length?  Duration?  Number of particles?
<br>
<br>
&gt; "Those infinite games ... are they any better then the game of chess? Aren't they even more useless?"
<br>
<br>
In a finite universe, such "infinite games" are merely tools of the language.  Their consequences tell us more about the nature of our axioms, and our system of logic, than they tell us about the universe.  Perhaps that is useless.
<br>
<br>
But my central point, really, is that the very conceptualization of "number", even over only "finite sets", is an invention that we apply in an attempt to describe what we perceive, and may bear no real relationship to "what is".
<br>
<br>
In some formulations, the universe contains some 10^n "electrons".  In another formulation, the universe only contains 1 electron, which has been forward-backward scattered in time to yield the appearance of multiplicity of "identical" particles.  So, what is it that we are attempting to assign "number" to, in the first place?  Only to what we conceptualize as reality.
<br>
<br>
In applying math in our conjectures about the universe, what we REALLY end up studying is the relationships between invented elements of our universe-concepts, in terms of yet more abstracted invented concepts (number, order, member-of, subset-of, etc.)
<br>
<br>
If the universe is really and entirely inter-connected at some deeper and more fundamental level, the whole concept of set and membership may not map at all to "reality".  But we pretend that the universe can be broken down into truly separable parts, and then begin counting ...
<br>

<br>
<br>
Actually, limits are a relatively recent development in calculus, at least they were not commonly used until more recent times.
<br>
<br>
Before limits, the concept of "infinitessimals" which do not obey Archimedes Principle were used instead of epsilon-deltas with limits.
<br>
<br>
These are the Hyperreal numbers: Around every real number, there is a number-line of infinitessimals. You cannot add any number of infinitessimals to get to the next real number. Thus they form a "Monad" around the real number and do not follow Archimedes Principle of well-ordering.
<br>
<br>
In calculus, this is what you do instead of using limits:
<br>
<br>
Take the derivative of: 2x^3
<br>
Let D denote an infinitessimal number.
<br>
<br>
then ((2(x+D)^3) - 2x^3)/D defines the derivative.
<br>
And we have:
<br>
= (2x^3+6x^2D+6xD^2+2D^3 - 2x^3)/D
<br>
= (6x^2D+6xD^2+2D^3)/D
<br>
= 6x^2+6xD+2D^2
<br>
<br>
Since we are only concerned about the real part of the number, we leave the monadic components out (Anything with a factor of D), and we can represent this by R, the funcion that maps numbers to their real number, which produces:
<br>
<br>
R(6x^2+6xD+2D^2) = 6x^2
<br>
<br>
Which is the correct derivative. Notice that everthing is finite, the only thing we have to do is abandon Archimedes Principle. This abandonment of Archimedes Principle was the reason that mathematicians eventually turned to limits rather than using "infinitessimal" numbers.</p></td>

You are right, the calculus can be defined and worked without appeal to the idea of "infinitely many terms", or infinite limits to such sequences.
<br>
<br>
But, in terms of "mapping" to a (conjectured) "finite-state universe", the monad approach is equally "un-real".  The concept of a non-zero value, so small that no finite multiple of it can amount to anything definitively "bigger than zero" (the violation of the Archemidean principle) is just as hard to realize in a universe of finite elements, as would infinite sequences of diminishing real positive values.
<br>
<br>
In some ways, the monad concept is more elegant, as the limit arguments become unnecessary.  In another way, the limit method is more elegant, as no new "type" of numbers needs to be introduced.
<br>
<br>
(Scott, the worst part for me was not the chalk dust, but my feet, from standing on a concrete floor N-hours a day.  Still, enjoyable overall :)

&gt; the calculus would be difficult to develop in only finite terms, however
<br>
<br>
We don't need it. Anymore.
<br>
<br>
Historically we need it, but not now, when Mathematica is a string of bits, very capable of doing even old fashioned calculus, we can do without the _ideal_ SMOOTH calculus.
<br>
<br>
The path through infinity was useful. The leather which we climbed, and can be disposed now.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Or even the _finite_ set of all possible clouds of particles. It's not THAT huge, at all! About 2^(10^90). Inside that number, every conceivable infinite set is accounted for.
<br>
<br>
&gt; I assume you mean "every conceivable FINITE subset of the cloud, assuming the cloud is itself finite. 
<br>

The set of all possible clouds of particles. My head is one of those clouds. Your head and my head is another one. The oldest oxygen atom inside our Sun, plus the youngest whale is another one.

<br>
<br>
You are right (if the universe is finite-state), then infinity and "smoothness" become unnecessary.  All that is needed is "finity" to represent all that can be represented...
<br>
<br>
But again, my central point is to focus upon the word "represented".
<br>
<br>
As I said earlier, the very conceptualization of "number", even over only "finite sets", is an invention that we apply in an attempt to describe what we perceive, and may bear no real relationship to "what is".  We assign "number" only to what we conceptualize as reality.
<br>
<br>
In applying math in our conjectures about the universe, what we REALLY end up studying is the relationships between invented elements of our universe-concepts, in terms of yet more abstracted invented concepts (number, order, member-of, subset-of, etc.)
<br>
<br>
If the universe is really and entirely inter-connected at some deeper and more fundamental level, the whole concept of set and membership may not map at all to "reality". (Perhaps, even "True" and "False" become inappropriate labels to anything real.)  But we pretend that the universe can reduced to truly separable parts, that Boolean propositions made about those parts are (thus) either true or false.  Then we begin counting "things" according to (equipotently) arbitrary divisions and categories we have invented and assigned to "reality", in order to determine what is "true or false" about the universe.  Yet what we have really done is determine what is consistent with, or inconsistent with our particular concept-system.
<br>
<br>
Do "concepts" make the universe?  Only if you believe that the universe is "God's Concept", that all existence can be traced to God saying "Let it be so".
<br>
<br>
But then, who's concept is "God"?
<br>

I do however, see the "Amish of the future"; a large percentage of humanity who choose to accept a level of technology, and live happily in that controlled environment.
<br>
<br>
It seems clear to me that not too far in the future, un-enhanced humans will not able to assimilate changes in paradigm rapidly enough.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I predict at least 8 races of human-kind:
<br>
<br>
1) Traditional and purely biological Human beings.
<br>
2) Cybernetically and computationally enhanced biological Human beings.
<br>
3) Virtual Human beings. Duplicates of once biological humans, now running in hardware.
<br>
4) AI-Human beings. Beings created from the lessons learned from reverse engineering the biological brain and who utilise the speed of computers naturally.
<br>
6) Humanimals. Human consciousness inhabiting the body of an animal, either natural or created.
<br>
7) Humandroids. Human consciousness inhabiting any physically mobile artifical device, be it body or vehicle.
<br>
8) Human^^ being. Where ^^ is a collective consciousness contributed to by numbers 3 through 7.
<br>
<br>
Humans may, from No.3 onwards, migrate seemlessly between states, and abilities.
<br>
<br>
It would seem that the concept of what is human is going to be pushed a long way. Also, clearly, that there will be a split within the various races of Humans.
<br>
<br>
The optimist would argue however, that very advanced Human consciousness, whether artifical, natural, or enhanced would be able to remove or negate the bad side of human nature, and become truly civilised. I live in hope, anyway!
<br>
<br>
Advances in social engineering, and in understanding human nature will ALSO advance at incredible rates, making it easier to allow people to be happy in their chosen role(s).
<br>
<br>
With wisdom, and good fortune, Humans will conquer the universe quite rapidly. They might not look anything like you or I, (unless they feel a bit nostalgic) or have much in common with us, except our curious nature, our nurturing, caring, inventive natures. Our love of life, and freedom, and family.</p></td>

He didn't have the right vocabulary for it but his stories definately follow along logically. Nor did he have alot of the scientific truth that we have now. But the way he includes our biological intellectual politics with the evolution of our intelligence is very similar.
<br>
<br>
This thread also filled alot of holes that I once thought were flaws in Issac's stories. Like why does he think that we are the only intelligent life in the galaxy.
<br>
<br>
If you haven't read any of his work you should. The guy basically predicts our future from now out to 200,000 years from now. 
<br>
<br>
It's fluff but he weaves it all together brilliantly.

Regardless, many of you seem very afraid of what Kurzweil is talking about, and I don't understand why. You seem to think that integration between humans and technology will turn us into a plague that has no emotion and coats the universe with the plaque of intelligence. And intelligence used to be such a positive word... It seems to me that if you stop thinking fearfully about what will go wrong and think creatively about how beautiful things could be you'll be much less, well, negative! I'm pretty convinced the singularity is a very real prediction, but even if it isn't the universe won't stop changing. If the singularity isn't the particular path that change will take, then so be it. But I hope you all won't be afraid of that too. I see a lot of "what will we use all of that computation and intelligence for?" How about learning to put away our weapons and live peacefully. Or lessening the required labor for sustaining life so that we don't have to work at least 40 hours a week. And in all that free time we'll use our computation and intelligence to make and enjoy art in all it's forms. An actual, feasible heaven because we could be more like souls living in harmony than fearful hateful animals. Of course it is only a possiblity and it's highly optimistic. But it seems to me with more power we would have to learn to be less destructive, or ourselves be destroyed. And less destruction doesn't sound like a humanless cancer to me. We could control the our surroundings in ways not even comprehendable, and if we didn't use that power for the classic "good" and our sheer entertainment we'd probably go extinct in a day. Now why would we do that? Where did the idea come from that we must lose everything good to fuse with technology?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Ray and Board Users,
<br>
<br>
By way of introduction I am a neuroengineering grad student at Georgia Tech who is studying signalling dynamics in cultures of ~10,000 neurons using computational modeling, microscopy, and multi-electrode arrays.
<br>
<br>
I am currently assembling my thoughts on mind uploading and other similar neuroscience flights of fancy.  I am finding that most authors typically ignore dynamics in thinking about the human brain.
<br>
<br>
While I find that Kurzweil's writing on the subject to be highly inspirational, I believe there are some errors in the description of the physical systems that if could corrected would make the arguments much more believeable.  
<br>
<br>
The human brain is THE most complex (most information dense) object we have yet encountered in the Universe. So when Ray says that it has a manageable complexity, he is saying we can manage to understand any level of complexity in the Universe. While I would agree with this statement in principle, I don't think we are quite there yet. 
<br>
<br>
The hardest part about understanding how the human mind works is going to be the mathematics.  The physical description of the parts of the nervous system is becoming routine, but it is the description of the incredibly complex dynamics you find in even the simplest nervous systems that boggles our attempts to understand it.
<br>
<br>
There is going to have to be a revolution in the understanding of complex dynamical systems in order to fully understand how highly evolved biological nervous systems process information.  I am confident this can be achieved, but it will be an intellectual accomplishment on the same scale as Newton's Principia.  It is no mean feat, and will require a flash of genius that is only seen once in a generation, not just an increase in our technical abilities.
<br>
<br>
Once we have this understanding of the brain and complex dynamical systems in general, we really are on way to understanding any physical system we might encounter and any barrier to Spiritual Machines will be lifted. 
<br>
<br>
A final note, please regard this as an advertisement for young mathematicians.  Mathematical description of biological nervous systems are THE hardest problems you can find in applied mathematics and it is a wide open field. 
<br>
I am a biologist trying to become a mathematician, but I realize that I may be outclassed by the problems I face.  For those who have huge intellectual ambitions, this is the problem to be working on.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
Peter</p></td>

Not because I don't want it to happen but because Ray does not believe that any limits will be imposed on the exponential rate of progress in computing power that we have been experiencing over the last few decades.
<br>
<br>
In a Petri dish, cells can go on dividing at regular intervals for however long, implying exponential growth, and then brutally run out of resources and come to a plateau. I believe this is what is going to happen to the computing industry sooner or later. Already fabrication plants are the realm of very few multinationals, and each new one requires billions of dollars in investment. Each new technology incremental step requires huge investments. How long will hardware company continue to afford these investments?

Right now the CPU in your PC is roughly 100x faster than the one you had 10 years ago (not 1000x like written in the article). It also generates about 10x the heat. 10 years ago CPUs didn't need a fan to cool them. In another 10 years at this rate the average CPU in your PC will generate ~1kw of heat and will require air conditioning. It will be much more expensive to run than to buy solely because of this reason. Few people will be able to run the CPUs of the next decade, which will require more power to cool them than most houses consume today. Consider that the most powerful Intel CPU today (Itanium 2) consumes about 200W... Here's one problem that parallel processing will not help with.
<br>
<br>
Energy demand is going to be a big bummer, and in spite of much work in this area, most of the energy in the world still comes from non-renewable sources and very little effort is being expended to find and exploit other sources of energy.
<br>
<br>
It is foolish to extrapolate the exponential growth of today without taking into account all the variables.
<br>
<br>
In the end it comes down to hot air. </p></td>

Firstly, the fact that it basically ignores all the great thinkers of consciousness from Heidegger to Merleau-Ponty and, secondly, because it fails to address any of the critiques Lyotard, Foucault and others have made of its supposed legitimacy.
<br>
<br>
It is rather ridiculous that Kurzweil has been accused of having an 'impoverished view of spirituality' when his thinking is so shamelessly theistic and dialectical.  The blatant resurrection of the One (one consciousness, one intelligence saturating all space and time, etc.) is so awfully theistic has no right to claim itself as anything other than some kind-of mystical fiction.  Reading Kurzweil and the other thinkers of Strong AI, one is confronted with extremely Hegelian (another thinker not mentioned anywhere) notions of 'rising' towards Absolute Spirit; notions so backwards and silly it is small wonder the topic hasn't been taken more seriously by the philosophical community at large (Badiou, Zizek, etc.). 
<br>
<br>
In the Kurzweilian narrative humanity is exponentially progressing towards a 'Singularity' (a point beyond which nothing can be reliably conceived).  Isn't this in fact nothing more than a tautology parading as scientific discourse that serves to legitimate such theological ideas as the One?  Scientific, mathematical and/or technological events, like all events, are unpredictable, they don't follow the simple-minded teleology put-forth by Kurzweil, so in a sense, this 'singularity'  could take-place tomorrow.  
<br>
<br>
All of these articles and all of this chatter can essentially be boiled down to the claim that humanity is 'progressing' towards One Super Intelligence ...  Yet, none of it makes an even slight advance towards solving the fundamental problems confronting Strong A.I. (proof of consciousness whatsoever, a definition of the subject, a software or mathematics that would make self-reflexivity possible, etc.)  Furthermore,  these backwards theistic dialectical ideas of progress (to move forward or develop to a higher, 'better', more advanced stage) which have been completely destabilized by philosophical postmodernism are so preposterously assumptive they warrant no well-reasoned criticism (Better??!!  Positing a faster, more complex intelligence, with more information at its disposal does nothing in the way of addressing the consciousness of consciousness as such ' Nor does it explain this whole mystical assumption of better-ness). 
<br>
<br>
I am believer that the technologies being celebrated here have the potential to answer some of the most profound questions imaginable, and am certainly open to the idea that this is the last generation of humans that will be biologically identical to those from 10,000 years ago, but all this backwards religiosity parading as science does nothing to help this goal.  
<br>
<br>
One MUST contend with not only the poltical dimension implicit in the developement of technology, but its narrative dimension and what that narrative legitimates and privelges and for what reason it does this...  None of this is addressed here.  On top of that, as said earlier, all of the REAL attempts at defining subjectivity philosophically (outside of Hofstader ... like Deleuze, for example) are completely ignored here.

<br>
I always remember a 60's movie in which an actor was put inside a time machine and sent to the future, millions of years from now...when this guy came out from the machine, he had a super developed brain and explained to the scientist that operated the machine that he had attained an  understanding of everything and had reached ultimate peace.
<br>
<br>
When I say perfect, I say: a mind with all what we consider good.  The bad is set aside in this path to perfectness. Bad is unstable, good is permanent and perfect.
<br>
<br>
Evolution is guided by this law also. The chemistry in the known universe is the same, ADN is the LIFE chemistry of all the Universe.
<br>
<br>
Carbon, is the perfect material, and is the main component of ADN, I heard we are entering in the Diamantine era, Diamond, (Carbon) is the perfect material.
<br>
<br>
Yo will see many new applicatinos of diamantine materials in the near future (Graphite structures for motors is an example).
<br>
<br>
So, life is a consequence of this chemistry, life is a Universal phenomena.

<br>
The life in the universe, as the most complex manifestation, is driven by this force of perfection.
<br>
<br>
And the Brain, has become a short cut in the evolution, it has attained the proper complexity very fast compared to the body evolution. 
<br>
<br>
And the brain is subject to this force too. If you look at the evolution of man, from barbaric to the most elevated forms of his intelligence, you see a permanent drive to correct the path to perfection.  Is like a control system with a set point but with low control gain. It osclllates and in the end is better.
<br>
<br>
I don't want to say we are now more perfect than several years ago, perhaps we are in an oscillation from the main path.
<br>
<br>
Any change in the evolution of the human mind , will also be attained in any other civilizations in the universe, before or after us.
<br>
<br>
Remember the Christ?, he represents one major step change in the human mind, the human mind acquired the comprehension of the Pardon and God's Mercy.
<br>
<br>
Before him, there was the Law of Talion and of a punishing God.
<br>
<br>
This divided history in two, B.C and A.C.
<br>
<br>
You might think then, that this will happen in all civilizations in the Universe, in one point of their evolution.
<br>
<br>
What will be the next major step?...

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The assumption that the universe was created gives rise to the creator. Are all the things created? The concept of creator, creation and created arises from understanding the origin of universal existance that can be cognized. Cognizance is developed with intelligence. So origin of universe bound in our cognizance is the origin of intelligence and vice-e-versa. Thus we may regard our intelligence as the creator. 
<br>
<br>
It may not be required to think of multiple existance of universe. 
<br>
<br>
It is very much possible that the strategy of singularity bound by our cognized universe is to recapitulate itself through our intelligence with our programmed infrastructure. Again we are a universally existing entity with certain properties and conditions of existance just like planets and stars. 
<br>
<br>
Our life has certain conditions and properties to exist. Similarly other bodies (rigid body-molecular infrastructure) in the cognized universe also exisit may be with different properties and conditions interpreted by our intelligence. Initiated by intelligence this whole constitution including us is always expanding exponentially pushing the corners of our cognizance still further. The process of initialization of expansion could be the molecular interactive form of energy. So this whole constitution may not be waiting. Waiting is an understanding of lapsed time and time is conceptualized by our intelligence. 
<br>
<br>
What we do on our planet, could be considered as a contribution to the continuous process of singularity that may come under our cognizance.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ray, I don't know about the anthropic principles accouting for us being the only ascendant intelligent life at least within our light sphere. What about the notion that at some point of advancement, intelligent matter just hits the paradigm shift of ceasing to base itself on matter and leaves the constraints of the physical universe, it's laws and time, all behind just like other paradigm shifts you have already alluded to? I think when you get to this point in the speculation, you are basing it on too many assumptions. If some of those assumptions are changed, you get totally different results, I imagine. One big assumption is that we sufficiently understand what the universe is. What would you assume about whatever framework the universe and possible other parallel universes all perhaps exist within? Maybe this evolutionary progression of intelligence just goes up to some point where it needs to keep on going in some state or sense that is beyond this universe of ours, as we currently conceptualize it, at least.
<br>
Hope that is food for more thought and feedback from you, cause I'd be curious to hear it.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think sometimes too much effort is spent on trying to differentiate between biological life/intelligence, AI and non-living matter.
<br>
<br>
In fact the boundries are pretty grey, maybe they don't even exsist.
<br>
Biological life has evolved from natural selection but AI, although created by design, is going and will go through a process of natural selection, and only the 'fittest' will survive/succeed.
<br>
<br>
The most important difference between living and non-living, as stated in this discussion before, is that life decreases entopy. Now entropy overall, in a closed system, can not decrease. In fact the increase in entropy signifies the direction of time i.e. entropy will increase with time. But life decreases entropy around itself while increasing it elsewhere, like making cars (made by decreasing entropy) in factories who emit heat and smoke (entropy).
<br>
<br>
Death is increase in entropy. But again, entropy is based on the thermodynamic behaviour of particles in a system - which is governed by Heisenberg's uncertainity principle. So fluctuations of increase or decrease in entropy are possible. Given these fluctuations, even non-living matter is not totally non-living. It has occasional 'blips' of life - when enropy decreases randomly. And when you apply natural selection to these 'blips', some may become more elaborate and may start self-propagating, thus becoming more clearly living.
<br>
<br>
We can only live at the expense of something else.
<br>
<br>
As to the idea of an intelligent Universe, it is not possible if we consider the Universe as a closed system. If the whole Universe becomes intelligent, entropy would have decreased, but that's impossible in a closed system. Of course, the concept of access to other universes is a way out.    </p></td>

We simply learn all there is to learn and explore every corner and master every possible ability.  Since we will be using actual subatomic particles to store data, this could be the "saturation".
<br>
<br>
I actually have a religious theory about this.  Living beings are inherently self propogating.  We all want to keep our species alive.  Its hard coded.  Combined with intelligence, this gives us curiosity, because the smarter we are, the more likely we are to propogate (though many high school nerds would disagree).  Curiosity makes us want to know everything.  If we knew that, then we would inherently be all powerful.  This power would allow our species to propogate without limit, until eventually we exist everywhere.  These three traits (omniscience, omnipotence, and omniprescence) are defining characteristics of god, as an idea.
<br>
<br>
My theory is that we find these traits so desirable as a species that we spend our time filling the gap between our current state and the near infitity of those three concepts.  So, we "project out" to near infinity those traits and the image that we see as god is nothing more than our desire to increase those things in our own species.
