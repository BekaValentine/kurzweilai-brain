<div class="TeaserText">A review of Michael Crichton's Prey, a novel featuring out-of-control, self-replicating nanotechnology. </div>
<br>
<br> <i>Originally published on </i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164447/http://nanotech-now.com/Chris-Phoenix/prey-critique.htm" target="_blank">Nanotechnology 
            Now</a><i>, Jan. 2003. Published on KurzweilAI.net Jan. 27, 2003. 
            Note: to explain what's wrong with the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in </i>Prey<i>, this 
            review contains spoilers.</i>
<p> Imagine a horror story about baseball in which the batter keeps 
              hitting the ball hard enough to kill the fans. The story might be 
              entertaining, but it's obviously unrealistic. Suppose further that 
              at one point in the story, the author writes about someone walking 
              back to the dugout after three "fouls." Does the author not know 
              the difference between a foul and a strike, or was he simply in 
              too much of a hurry to bother getting the words right? Either way, 
              no one could learn the rules of baseball from that story. Even if 
              it was mostly right, a few wrong facts make all the difference&#8212;especially 
              if the reader does not know which facts are wrong. <br>
<br>
<i>Prey</i> contains comparable exaggerations and mistakes in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. 
              A scanning probe microscope and an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> microscope are <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 
              tools of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and they're not even remotely similar. 
              Yet Crichton confuses the two, on page 133. He also confuses piezoelectric 
              with photovoltaic. And he writes about a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a> that's "one ten-billionth 
              of an inch in length." This is the size of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, not a 
              whole <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. But these are simple errors; the flaws in his <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> 
              run deeper. <br>
<br>
              Crichton's hypothetical <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is built in a multi-stage 
              process. First, <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> produce chemicals, which are modified and 
              then combined to form "<a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s." The <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s are attached 
              to other <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, which produce more chemicals that are combined 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s into the final product: a tiny, flying <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with 
              an onboard <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, solar <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, and other useful gizmos. Remember 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> are attached to the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, not to the final 
              swarm-bot product. And the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> are not involved in the function 
              of the final swarm-bot (nor is the swarm-bot involved in the assembly 
              process). But for some unexplained <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, people infected with 
              the swarm-bots melt (in seconds) when splashed with a <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>-killing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, which should have no effect on the swarm-bots. It makes no 
              sense&#8212;it was simply necessary to the story. <br>
<br>
              Even this is not the biggest problem with the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. The cornerstone 
              of the book is <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and emergent behavior. Crichton's 
              explanations are too superficial to allow detailed criticism, but 
              there are a few obvious impossibilities. 
            <p>For example, the swarm supposedly "learns" by reproducing itself: 
              the dumb swarm-bots die off, and the more effective ones survive 
              to reproduce. (How their <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is fed back into the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s 
              is not explained.) But when the swarm first infects the humans, 
              it immediately begins to coexist&#8212;and even to make them look 
              healthier and to modify their behavior in subtle ways. The swarm 
              can't reproduce in humans. For one thing, there's no gallium or 
              arsenic for the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. (There's not much gallium or arsenic 
              lying around a desert, either.) So how did the swarm learn how to 
              get along with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and cognition? There's no way it could 
              have. <br>
<br>
              Crichton's introduction, "Artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> in the Twenty-first 
              Century," appears to be a serious attempt to warn us about the dangers 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that is capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. He closes by saying 
              that if someone manages to create evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s before they 
              can be regulated, "... it is difficult to anticipate what the consequences 
              might be. That is the subject of the present <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>." The scientific 
              explanations scattered throughout the book increase the apparent 
              plausibility of the story. Even the name Xymos is a clear reference 
              to the real-world <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> company <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a>. 
            <p>It seems that Crichton is doing his best to scare the readers about 
              real-world <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>&#8212;he wants his audience to believe that the scenario 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> could actually happen as described! He might succeed 
              in scaring people; a friend of mine who's a geneticist told me that 
              <i>Jurassic Park</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> back public <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              by a decade. This would be unfortunate, because the <i>Prey </i>scenario 
              contains so many implausibilities&#8212;and impossibilities&#8212;that in 
              the end, the reader will have learned nothing about the actual risks 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>. <br>
<br>
              It is worth listing a few more of the exaggerations in the book. 
              For example, Crichton describes glass as being unsuitable for handling 
              chemicals: "At the molecular level, glass is like Swiss cheese, 
              full of holes. And of course it's a liquid, so atoms just pass right 
              through it." (p. 131). A little <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> shows that this is, 
              at best, stretching the truth. <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a> bulbs, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> thermos bottles, 
              and TV tubes can last for decades; they all depend on the fact that 
              atoms normally can't pass through glass. (Helium can make it through--in 
              vanishingly small amounts--but helium is completely inert.) 
            <p>Another exaggeration is the idea that the swarms could coevolve 
              with worms in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of days. Even if the swarms could evolve 
              that quickly, the worms could not. Finally, a significant impossibility 
              is the idea that a swarm-bot could fit inside a <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> (p. 256). 
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a> is only a few atoms wide; the swarm-bots are hundreds 
              or thousands of times bigger. But without this impossibility, a 
              major sub-plot falls apart. <br>
<br>
              The exaggerations are not only about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>. Near the end of the 
              story, a character sets off all the fire sprinklers by melting one 
              of them. Despite what we've all seen in the movies, sprinkler <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              don't really work that way. Crichton's characters also explode welder's 
              thermite to destroy the clouds of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s. According to the welding 
              supply company I called, thermite is used for welding because it 
              burns hot enough to melt metal&#8212;but it does not explode. I was told 
              it probably wouldn't even ignite a sheet of paper a few feet away. 
              <br>
<br>
              This is not to say that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> is completely safe. The possibility 
              of "gray goo"&#8212;self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s&#8212;has been discussed from 
              the beginning. But gray goo would be very difficult to design. It 
              would be far more complex than a car&#8212;probably more complex than 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Shuttle. General Motors recently made headlines by taking 
              only a few months to design a car. 
            <p>It's completely implausible that a failing company could create 
              an evolving gray goo by re-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering a specialized product in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of weeks; this same company couldn't even solve the relatively 
              simple problem of keeping the swarm together in a breeze. Remember 
              that the swarm-bots don't directly replicate; they are built by 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s using <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l chemicals. Among other tasks, the scientists 
              would have had to rapidly invent a way to transfer the evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              out of the successful swarm-bots and feed it back into the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s 
              or the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> to produce the next generation. This would require 
              a completely new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. <br>
<br>
              In Crichton's stories, the scientists are mad&#8212;all but one 
              who moans about how "<a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> will find a way" and "we should not 
              play with things we don't understand." In the real world, it's the 
              other way around. We won't have <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s for years, maybe decades, 
              but scientists have already written a <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> of practice, the "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164447/http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html" target="_blank">Foresight 
              Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology</a>," that would prohibit 
              anything remotely like what Crichton has invented. And because <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              doesn't work as magically as Crichton portrays it, scientists probably 
              wouldn't even be tempted to release evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s; in real <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, 
              the swarm would have been destroyed almost immediately, and so would 
              never have had a chance to improve itself. <br>
<br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> is genuinely interesting, and in some ways even scary. 
              Hopefully, <i>Prey</i>will generate interest in the subject; reliable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is available on-line and in numerous 
              books. Readers of <i>Prey</i> should remember that it does not provide 
              a realistic portrayal of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Many parts are impossible, 
              and many others are stretched beyond plausibility. 
            <p>For real, scary <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, read non-fiction such as <i>The Demon 
              in the Freezer</i> by Richard Preston. Smallpox isn't as trendy 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s&#8212;but unlike <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s, smallpox already exists, 
              and could easily be used by terrorists. <i>Prey</i> is not scary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> because (to be blunt) very little of it is real; those who 
              let themselves be scared by it might as well wear protective gear 
              to the next baseball game.&#160;

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>What Chris Phoenix fails to realize, in his commentary on the Michael Chrichton novel "PREY", is that the story is a work of fiction.  Fiction writers have been entertaining audiences for decades with worse exaggerations and implausibilities.  Quite frankly, if we limited writers to fact-based fiction only the creative process in literature and science would suffer.  How often have those of us without hard-science training added to the field due to a dream or because we read something which intrigued us?  </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt; What Chris Phoenix fails to realize, in his commentary on the Michael Chrichton novel "PREY", is that the story is a work of fiction. Fiction writers have been entertaining
<br>
<br>
Not just 'entertaining'...
<br>
<br>
&gt; audiences for decades with worse exaggerations and implausibilities. Quite frankly, if we limited writers to fact-based fiction only the creative process in literature and science would suffer. 
<br>
<br>
The straying from the facts is not the problem.
<br>
<br>
&gt; How often have those of us without hard-science training added to the field due to a dream or because we read something which intrigued us?
<br>
<br>
I have no idea. I think Hollywood is basically simpe. It is all about writing 'nicely' or nicely but very confident.
<br>
<br>
The problem: filmmakers get carried away. Their timing is just a little off. What I really sense is them giving in to pressure. I really want heroes delivering entertainment to hundreds of millions of people.
<br>
<br>
I know this kind of writing must be getting old so I'll leave it at that.

Crichton's book may not be dead on, but read any of Ray Kurzweil's books about thinking and spirtual machines... far more guesses about the future than hard evidence, more science fiction than science.   </p></td>
