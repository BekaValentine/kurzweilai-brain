<div class="TeaserText">Push Singh was a young MIT post doc making important contributions to AI with his Open Mind Common Sense project, a Web-based approach to acquire common sense knowledge from the general public. He was also one of KurzweilAI.net's big thinkers. He will be missed by us, and by many others.</div>

<p>It was with great sadness that I learned of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316122855/http://www.kurzweilai.net/bios/frame.html?main=/bios/bio0152.html%20" target="_top">Push 
              Singh</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> on 28 February this year. This remembrance is 
              in lieu of the essay we expected to publish for his "AI Ten 
              to Watch" award. It would be hard to write even if I knew him 
              only through the paperwork submitted with his nomination. In Push's 
              case, however, it's much harder, for I had recently begun talking 
              with him about <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> ideas, and he had some exciting <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s 
              that I was eager to pursue during an upcoming sabbatical.</p>
<p> Push started at the Massachusetts Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> as an 
              undergraduate in 1988, staying on as a graduate student and completing 
              his thesis in MIT's Department of Electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> in 2005. His advisor was <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, one of AI's founders. 
              Push was slated to begin a position as a faculty member in the MIT 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Laboratory in 2007 after, as he described it to me, a much-needed 
              year off "to think."</p>
<p> Push's research was based partly on Marvin's <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>-of-minds 
              approach, exploring what <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> was and how it could develop. 
              His thesis, "EM-ONE: An <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">Architecture</a> for Reflective Commonsense 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a>," included the creation of Open <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a> Common Sense 
              (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316122855/http://csc.media.%20mit.edu/" target="_blank">http://csc.media.mit.edu</a>), 
              a Web-based approach to acquire commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from the general 
              public. He also developed a layered cognitive architecture aimed 
              at exploring how <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing about physical, social, and mental <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s 
              could work.</p>
<p> In remembering him, Marvin Minsky said, "Push had just been 
              appointed to become a new professor at MIT, to pursue what we knew 
              would be a brilliantly productive career. For several years we have 
              been designing an ambitious project to develop [commonsense] theories, 
              which have slowly been gaining the interest of many researchers 
              inside and outside the Media Lab. To us his loss is indescribable 
              because of how we could communicate so much and so quickly in so 
              very few words, as though we were parts of a single mind."</p>
<p> Henry Lieberman, who worked with Push on the Open Mind project, 
              said, "Push and his students worked on collecting common sense 
              and developing architectures and tools surrounding the knowledge. 
              My students and I concentrated on applying this knowledge to improve 
              all kinds of interactive applications: <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>s, editors, games, 
              phones, etc. Push helped me teach my course, where we taught students 
              how to understand and work with commonsense knowledge. It has now 
              grown to the point that there are numerous projects involving common 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in many, if not most, of the other groups at the Media Lab, 
              and also elsewhere. This collaboration has been one of the most 
              productive and fruitful of my career, and I thus owe him a tremendous 
              debt that I shall never have the opportunity to repay." (For 
              these and many other tributes to Push, see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316122855/http://pedia.media.mit.edu/wiki/Push_Singh" target="_blank">http://pedia.media.mit.edu/wiki/Push_Singh</a>.)</p>
<p> In my own discussions with Push, we were exploring how to put 
              his commonsense work, especially the Open Mind project, together 
              with the Semantic Web work I do. From the first moment we talked, 
              I could tell he was a brilliant young man with inspiring ideas. 
              I looked forward to working with him, fully expecting to learn more 
              than I could teach. We planned a visit for him to discuss his research 
              and how we could proceed. While I didn't know him as well as Marvin, 
              Henry, and the many students, faculty, and friends he had at MIT 
              and beyond, I can't believe I'll never get a chance to pursue these 
              ideas with this talented young scientist. He will be missed.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'm sorry Push has died. It's a loss like the death in a car crash of Seymore Cray (the greatest supercomputering architect in history).
<br>
<br>
I had a brief emails with Push after Prof. Aaron Slomann introduced us, when our projects were both starting up. He drafted 'commonsense' &amp; I BESS. 
<br>
<br>
I didn't really know him as our approaches were radically different.
<br>
<br>
He had a growing reputation as an upcoming A.I. mind.
<br>
<br>
He had a strong committment to the wide community  was keen on opensource, and a valuable support to Narvin Minsky who'd marked him for appointment as professor at MIT.
<br>
<br>
I cant assess his work.
<br>
<br>
Like Doug Lenat's it was a system making lists of  observations about the world, and I contributed for fun:
<br>
<br>
a table is flat..
<br>
<br>
Humans are biological beings
<br>
<br>
etc
<br>
<br>
The idea was a data base so you could access knowledge and eventualy derive new information from it. You can see what's happening to his project here:

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chris McKinstry was doing a similar project, Mindpixel.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
He died a few weeks before Push this year.
<br>
<br>
<br>
A.I. researchers have intense gifts and the emotions are very great that come with them.
<br>
<br>
One army general I met at a technical meeting revealed he was exasperated by the numbers of clever minds that were dysfunctional in A.I. but no progress could be made without them.
<br>
<br>
Like test pilots we try the impossible to sometimes prove it possible.
<br>
<br>
My cousin was a great USAF test pilot killed trying a new manouvre.
<br>
<br>
I dint think flying in the mind is so diffrent.
<br>
<br>
We are pioneers. I see it in us.
<br>
<br>
It's imperative we stay survive.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
They were both killed/died trying to build Strong A.I:
<br>
<br>
One died in January and the other in February this year).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Both were young.
<br>
<br>
Anyone who doubts A.I. is the front and parallel to the first attenots at flight should take note.

In McKinstry's case he had a long history of emotional instability, and was a marginal figure on the fringes of the AI research community.  He'd struggled to keep his AI project afloat, and killed himself for trivial reasons after some kind of squabble with his girlfriend.
<br>
<br>
Push Singh was really in the opposite situation.  As far as I could tell he had a bright future ahead of him, and was slated to become an MIT professor (an almost unassailable position in academic circles).  After Singh's death there were rumours of some kind of suicide pact between the two, since they were both working in the same area (common sense reasoning) and the deaths were only a few weeks apart.  I doubt there was any connection though.</p></td>

This doesn't mean that the universe is not ordered by laws.

Where the universe NOT ordered by laws it could not exist.

As it IS ordered by laws, then knowledge of those laws MUST anable the most acute measurements and extrapolations.

iagree we cant do that on present machinery, but my expectation/gamble is that coming suoerintelligent machines will be able to - because it is doable.

Still, it would be interesting to know if his suicide was in any way related to his work.  My guess would be that it probably wasn't.  More likely it was girlfriend trouble (similar to McKinstry) or health problems (such as being diagnosed with cancer or some other severe illness).</p></td>
