<div class="TeaserText">On July 19, 2001, the International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design hosted an online chat with Ray Kurzweil, Jay Richards, and William Dembski, three of the co-authors of  the new book, Are We Spiritual Machines? Ray Kurzweil vs. the Critics of Strong A.I. The discussion focused on the nature of consciousness, free will vs. determinism, complexity, and implications of the eroding boundary between humans and intelligent machines.</div>

              Welcome, everyone. ISCID is pleased to have several of the contributors 
              to the new book <i>Are We <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s?</i> as guest speakers 
              in today's chat. Before we announce the speakers, I would like to 
              give everyone a heads-up on the protocol for today's chat.</p>
<p>The public (that is most of you) can type in questions and submit 
              them. The questions will not automatically be displayed. Rather, 
              they will be sent to a moderator who will then select questions 
              for everyone to view. The guest speakers will then have the opportunity 
              to respond to the questions that have been selected. When the guest 
              speakers have finished their comments, the moderator will approve 
              another question. This cycle will continue until 5PM Eastern. When 
              submitting a question, please indicate which guest speaker it is 
              addressed to. Please stay on topic and be as brief and concise as 
              possible.</p>
<p>Right now it looks like Ray K. and Jay Richards are the only two 
              guest speakers logged on.</p>
<p>I will go ahead and introduce them and the others we are expecting.</p>

              Ok. It looks as if, right now, Ray may be the only one who is actually 
              "here" with us.</p>
<p><b>ISCID Moderator</b><br>
              So lets get started.</p>
<p><b>Danpech</b><br>
              While we can have the idea that there are things outside our self 
              that are aware only because we our self are aware, it is granted 
              by nearly every one as <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive fact that there are things outside 
              himself that do not possess awareness (that do not feel either sensorily 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>ally, that do not think, etc.). In my opinion, central 
              to the problem of multiple realizability is the question of how, 
              in the first place, we each get the very idea that there are things 
              that are not aware. How do you, personally, know that there are 
              things that are not aware?</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></b><br>
              I don't know that absolutely. Maybe I'm the only person who's conscious. 
              That's consistent with a <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>. Even by common <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, there seem 
              to be both people and <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s in my <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> that are outside myself, 
              but clearly they were created in myself and are part of me; they 
              are mental constructs in my own <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Or maybe every other <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> 
              is conscious. I'm not sure what that would mean, as some <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              may not have much to be conscious of. It's hard to even define what 
              each <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> or thing is that might be conscious, as there are no 
              clear boundaries. Or maybe there's more than one conscious awareness 
              associated with my own <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and body. There are plenty of hints 
              along these lines with multiple personalities, or people who appear 
              to do fine with only half a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (either half will do). We appear 
              to be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med with the idea that there are "things" 
              outside of our self, and some are conscious, and some are not. That's 
              how we're constructed. But it's not entirely clear that this intuitive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion matches perfectly to ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/ontology_entry.html">ontology</a>.</p>

              Ray, what are your <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s on the Frame Problem? Do you see it 
              as a challenge that requires a "paradigm shift" in <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              before <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is attainable?</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></b><br>
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of frames as discussed by Minsky and others has a variety 
              of interpretations, but generally refers to issues of <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> that incorporates such <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s as inheritance 
              of features. And yes, I do think a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> is required from 
              this kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology. We'll never get to anything 
              with the suppleness and subtlety of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with expert 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> rules. That's not how <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> works.</p>
<p>Although the work on a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> such as <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a> is impressive and worthwhile, 
              it's clear that this type of approach will not create <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> works through <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, 
              which uses a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> combining massive parallelism, chaotic <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a>, 
              and holographic-like <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is very slow; typical interneuronal connection reset 
              times are 5 milliseconds, so we don't have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to 
              think through complex sequential rules. But we do have on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              of a 100 trillion connections working more or less simultaneously

              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">Pattern recognition</a> approaches have softer edges to their expertise. 
              We need to bring <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies to <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s such

<p><b>Brandon Watson</b><br>
              Your replies to your critics often seem to involve what might be 
              called a moderate skepticism about other <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>es. That is, 
              you seem to proceed in something like this way: There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive 
              test for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>; so it cannot be decided with certainty whether 
              any given thing is conscious, although we do assume it in certain 
              cases based on <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> with ourselves; so we can concern ourselves 
              entirely with the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive correlates of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>; we can 
              build functionally equivalent versions of these; so we will reach 
              a point at which our <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for calling the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> conscious 
              will be as good as our <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for calling anything else conscious. 
              Do you regard your conclusions as dependent on this line of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>? 
              Do we have any <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> beyond its subjectivity?</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></b><br>
              I do believe that the line of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that you aptly summarize 
              is more than just a philosophical slight of hand. We really do have 
              problems penetrating the subjective <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of other entities. Our 
              inability to do that with other humans is behind much <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> conflict. 
              Humans feel deeply the suffering of their friends and allies, and 
              easily discount/dismiss the comparable <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of their enemies.</p>
<p>How about <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s? <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a> disagreement on whether or not <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s 
              are capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>, e.g., suffering, or whether 
              they are just operating by "instinct," i.e., like a simple 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, lies behind our disputes on <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> rights.</p>
<p>This issue will be even more profound and difficult to resolve 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. On the one hand, one might argue that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are 
              less like humans than <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s because at least <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              and have many similar organs and <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s and behaviors. On the 
              other hand, since at least some <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be based on reverse 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of humans, these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s may be more similar to humans 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior than <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s.</p>
<p>Also relevant here is a rather <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant slippery slope. We're 
              already replacing portions of our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              equivalents. It's early yet in this process, but this will ultimately

              I'd like to come back on one of Ray's comments about <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. 
              Working with neural netsis an interest of mine. I have for a long 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> is a key <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              But surely it is only one small part. One might get a creative idea 
              by noting the similarity to another known idea (e.g., in "brainstorming"). 
              But the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> must also be supplemented by an intelligent 
              putting together of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, rather than just recognising similarity. 
              What kind of techniques do you see being developed for that?</p>
<p><b>Jay Richards</b><br>
              Perhaps instead of focusing on <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, we could consider 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>. One of the most readily apparent realities about ourselves 
              as persons is our <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for free choice. We <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> 
              directly, at least much more directly than we <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, say, the 
              external world. We choose between alternatives, and although we 
              are shaped by our <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, etc., we have the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that 
              these don't always determine our choices. This <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, and not 
              simply "consciousness," seems to me to be an essential 
              property of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. But it is very difficult to see how a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how advanced, which is governed by <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s 
              (and perhaps randomizing functions), could ever enjoy such <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>. 
              I'm not sure what Ray's view is on this, but I know some advocates 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">Strong AI</a> just deny the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of libertarian <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>. But

              Let's talk about the medium of emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Phenomena 
              must be appropriate to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> in which they occur. For example, 
              sound can occur only in a medium capable of supporting transverse 
              (compression-rarefaction) waves, and winged flight can occur only 
              in a gaseous atmosphere capable of providing the necessary lift. 
              It follows that there must be a relationship between the emergence 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and the medium in which it occurs. Specifically,

              of the medium. Unfortunately, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is unable to characterize

              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and the subjective issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Some people go 
              on to say that because the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is not scientific, 
              it is, therefore, not real, or an "illusion." That's not 
              my view. One can say that it is the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant question. It 
              underlies, for example, morality, and to the extent that our legal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is based on morality, then our legal <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. We treat crimes 
              that cause suffering of a conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> differently than damaging 
              "property". In fact, you can damage property if you own 
              it. We only punish damaging property because some other conscious 
              person cares about it.</p>
<p>With regard to "motivation," this is another high-level 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> that are inherent characteristics 
              of entities with the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and depth of organization of humans. 
              We don't yet have <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of that <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, but we will.Often, 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> can successfully predict the "free will" decisions 
              of others if that first <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> has a complete enough understanding 
              of the cultural model of the other.</p>

              In response to Sulu. I would assume that if one assumes that the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is deterministic (though I don't think predictability is 
              the same as <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a>), then one will deny the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of free 
              will. But such <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a> is hardly self-evident, even if lots 
              of folks say that it is such. My point is that we <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> directly, and as a result, should be much more 
              certain of its <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> than any theory that entails <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a>. 
              Moreover, even determinists, when they're not in a philosophical 
              mode, presuppose the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of such <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> when they make moral

              I understand, but rather than making assumptions, I'm trying to 
              get around certain assumptions already in place. For example, classical 
              spacetime has an ontological-qua-geometric lattice <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> with 
              dimensions matching those of Minkowski <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. The vertical (<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) 
              dimension of this lattice corresponds to logical <a class="thought" href="entries/induction_entry.html">induction</a> in the 
              regressive direction and logical <a class="thought" href="entries/deduction_entry.html">deduction</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ive direction. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a>ing down the lattice corresponds to moving forward in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 
              and involves a horizontal (spatial) expansion which accommodates 
              the expanding spatial distinctions among the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of spacetime 
              and is thus characterized by <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, the arrow of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is differentiative, and where (forward) <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is innately differentiative 
              in the classical <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, the establishment of true unity constitutes 
              a violation of <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. Any deterministic <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> emerging in 
              the course of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> assembly and <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> is merely a function 
              of distributed dynamical laws intersecting in specific arguments 
              which remain spatially separate throughout (and thus causally independent 
              in any spatial cross-section), despite being subject to identical 
              localistic laws. What, if anything, would make you think that this

              It's interesting that the etymology of "Person" is <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              to derive either from the Persian "persu" (meaning mask) 
              or Latin "personare" (meaning to sound through). In either 
              case, the person takes on a derivative and, dare I say it, "emergent" 
              role, not something fundamental.</p>

              Jay's <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> seems to be completely <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> of desire; this is

              Sulu's argument is an old one (which is not to criticize it). We 
              can introduce some randomness to both humans and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but that 
              as Jay points out still falls short of the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>. 
              It's almost impossible to articulate Jay's <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>, 
              except in the first person. But we will <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> most <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              (as we do most people) in the third person.</p>
<p><b>Paul Kisak</b><br>
              Asymptotes are the proof that <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> does not trust us;-) I have had 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> models that base their design, 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al ceiling, at 10^30 bits per second, which many believe 
              is an approximation of the brains <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>.</p>
<p>Correspondingly approximations have been made, based on the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s 
              that Ray alluded to earlier (10^11 <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and 10^14 <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s - 
              which I think is higher now (on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 10^16); yielding an 
              approximate 10^16 bits per second limit. The discrepancy is several 
              orders of magnitude. One model that I have read attempts to explain 
              this gap by building on the discovery that all <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> walls have hollow 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> microtubules and it is these <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s that facilitate 
              a quantum mechanical computing capability. QUESTION: Have you heard 
              of this theory, and if yes, what is your opinion of it?</p>
<p><b>Jay Richards</b> <br>
              Just to be clear, I have been referring to what Sulu called "freedom 
              of spontaneity." I think it is subjectively clear to us that 
              (at least sometimes) we can choose between mutually exclusive alternatives, 
              that things could otherwise than they are.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It seems people on this chat just talked past one another on the topic of free will. There are actually several notions of "free will" and "freedom." Here are some of the meanings of the various notions I've picked up on:
<br>
<br>
1) Theological and metaphysical free will: This concept of free will was invented to give Judeo-Christian theologies a seemingly less arbitrary and cruel God. If God judges' people and people's actions are determined by the universe God set in motion and thus determined, then he is ultimately punishing people for his own mistakes. God himself is ultimately responsible for the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, the rape and murder of young girls and abuse of young boys by priests as well as Pharaoh's hardened heart and the religion of the calf worshippers God ordered Moses to kill. This concept of free will puts the blame for evil on human shoulders rather than God's. So, our feeling of having choices was given metaphysical and theological significance, we will be judged by God because of our choices. These choices are usually cast in a very narrow and black and white frame of good versus evil. Because people with apparently theological notions don't make their views on free will explicit they tend to just confuse everybody who doesn't share the same theological view. 
<br>
<br>
I think this is Jay Richards' view, though he's not explicit about it because he knows he's arguing with someone in a non-Christian camp (atheist, agnostic, deist, Buddhist, Kurzweil). I think this because he has a Ph.D. in theology and it's the most common view of free will in our religious society. Richards also says things like "if one assumes that the universe is deterministic then one will deny the existence of free will." Why? The only notion of free will denied by determinism is the theological notion that places blame on humans for their choices. He also says; "even determinists, when they're not in a philosophical mode, presuppose the existence of freedom when they make moral judgments about the actions of others." Again, a false statement. In a certain sense I share a determinist's philosophy and I do not make'moral' judgments about other's behavior, I make survival judgments. Hey, those Islamic fundamentalists attacked us; let's kill them before they do it again. Unlike Bush I do not judge them as "evil," I just judge them as committed to a psychotic religion and blame the beliefs they were raised with. Richards say"...instead of focusing on consciousness, consider freedom. One of the most readily apparent realities about ourselves as persons is our capacity for free choice." This isn't even true; it's a much exaggerated statement suggesting a metaphysical view. Consciousness is far more apparent than free choice. I'm very aware of those things influencing my choices, my tastes, beliefs, emotions, values, confidence and knowledge. Change those things and I might change my choices. Richards says context isn't enough by saying; "we have the sense that these don't always determine our choices." Again, this is more or less false from my perspective. Our choices are determined by all our contexts, biology and culture, nature and nurture. Another clue is Richards statement; "I don't think predictability is the same as determinism." Actually those two ideas are so tightly tied together they might as well be the same. If I can predict someone's behavior it's only because I can determine what's influencing their choices. I could go on with my analysis, but I think you've probably got my drift.
<br>
<br>
2) A determinist's notion of free will: The "illusion" of free will results from a sense of internal conflict among our own desires. When I make a choice I am ultimately making a value judgment about my options.
<br>
<br>
This view allows for a less black and white view of choice. It's not just shades of grey; there is a multidimensional range of colors too. For example: If I'm presented with a choice between blueberry and pecan pie for desert there's no good and evil involved in such a choice, but I can be held in doubt for longer than I am by moral choices as I try to imagine the taste of both and judge which would please me more. It's a value outside of the very notion of good and evil but it involves a certain realm values, taste values.
<br>
<br>
3) Stochastic and chaotic view of free will: This view grows from the primitive determinist notion and incorporates the findings of modern neural science to correct the oversimplification of pure determinism. Randomness enters the system and neural firing can result in non-deterministic outcomes. It explains what we all have been living with but failed to notice; that we don't always make choices in what we know are our best interests or the values we think we hold, like smoking or drug addiction. I not only make choices on an individual basis, I have to develop good habits, I have to train my own neural net. I think this is Kurzweil's view because it's the dominant one in A.I..
<br>
<br>
4) Legal: The legal sense of "freedom" and "free will" isn't even related to free will and freedom used in the A.I. sense. It doesn't matter why you broke society's laws, it only matters that you did. Punishment works in all philosophies because punishment too obviously works in real life when it comes to changing behavior. If an A.I. tries to destroy the world, we will try to destroy it, not because we are making a moral judgment but because we want to survive. In fact, training neural nets is called 'reward and punishment' by some of those who work with them and no one talks about neural net chips having free will.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Norm,
<br>
<br>
Here is my take on the 4 form of "free will":
<br>
<br>
1) Theological and metaphysical free will:
<br>
<br>
Since you did not elaborate on the difference, I will take this to mean (at least) one explanation for the position of "real choice", as opposed to the illusion of choice.
<br>
<br>
To the degree that it presupposes a "Gift From A Judging God", I tend to reject this out of hand.  Even if it were true, I could not abide a God who will punish people for eternity.  Silly idea, altogether (and all too human a notion.)
<br>
<br>
To an unfortunate degree, this form of "free will" is so central to the western theological viewpoint, that scientists who reject God/metaphysics feel that they must likewise reject "free will", even though they now generally recognize that the universe is not a purely deterministic machine.  
<br>
<br>
Regarding determinism and predictability, these are not quite equal, but related.  If the universe is not purely deterministic, then perfect predictability is clearly impossible (but statistical predictability is still available).  However, if one supposes a purely deterministic universe, then perfect predictability is, at BEST, only "possible in principle".  Myriad factors may make effective prediction impossible.  In one such view, the entire universe would be required to afford the perfect prediction of its future course, and the computation, in perfect detail, could not proceed any faster than the universe "calculates itself anyway."  If it takes me until noon next thursday to calculate that a lightning bolt will strike a given tower at noon next thursday, that is not any great predictive power!
<br>
<br>
2) A determinist's notion of free will: The "illusion" of free will results from a sense of internal conflict among our own desires. When I make a choice I am ultimately making a value judgment about my options.
<br>
<br>
This is "no free will, with the illusion of free will", and the only possible view of "will" that a determinist is allowed, for obvious reasons.  It abuses the terms "free will", "choice", "decide" and "options", since none of these can actually exist except in an illusory and false way.  It might be characterized by saying that "we are all dominoes with illusions".
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the "deterministic machine" universe is a largely discarded notion in modern physics, an approximation appropriate only for statistical behaviors of large aggregates.  So I cannot see quite where the "deterministic view of non-will" has a place to stand.
<br>
<br>
3) Stochastic and chaotic view of free will: This view grows from the primitive determinist notion and incorporates the findings of modern neural science to correct the oversimplification of pure determinism. Randomness enters the system and neural firing can result in non-deterministic outcomes. It explains what we all have been living with but failed to notice; that we don?t always make choices in what we know are our best interests or the values we think we hold ...
<br>
<br>
This view is "closer" to mine, but is actually ambiguous about whether the added "randomness" allows for (not demands, but allows for) true free will, or whether it simply restricts predictability.
<br>
<br>
Even with such true randomness as an added input, it goes too far to say that this accounts for the "mistakes people make."  Our so-called "bad-choices" are not merely the mis-firings of an otherwise lock-step machine.  If we posit, for the moment, that we have "real true free will" (thus, "real" options), and place ourselves in the shoes of the desperate person raised in a cruel environment, we might "see our options" as rather poor ones, and honestly judge as "best" one that most of society would reject.  That does not necessarily imply that that a "mis-fire" occurred.
<br>
<br>
Morally speaking, I believe that even with a "true free will" perspective, we often "hold accountable" many whose situations did not leave them with very attractive options.
<br>
<br>
The results of QM imply that the notion of "continuous forward flow across points of time" is itself an approximation that breaks down upon sufficiently close inspection.  At the level of particle-spontaneity and zero-point energies, "point in time" is actually a fuzzy thing, where the universe tends to confuse "before" and "after".  From the study of chemistry, we know that the "near-ground states" of simply molecules have wide-jumps between different energy levels (bands), but as molecules become larger and more complex, the alternate states of these molecules (such as the difference in "twist" between a "cis" and a "trans" state) can become hyper-fine.  Since the brain is literally saturated with such molecules, those energy differences could be sensitive at the same levels at which zero-point energies, and the ambiguous sense of time, are the operating environment.
<br>
<br>
Although I have yet to fully think through how these views could actually allow a reflective mind to manifest "true-free-will", I cannot see why some believe it "plain" that true free will MUST be illusory.
<br>
<br>
4) Legal: The legal sense of "freedom" and "free will":
<br>
<br>
This is clearly a social invention, and (as I believe you observed) rather independent of whether or not free will exists.  It is a pragmatism, that serves to rationalize the (real) need to adjust socially harmful behaviors, or constrain the dangerous individual.
<br>

<br>
That's not quite right. It has a hint of theological propaganda in it. Determinism and (Stochasticism??) are naturalistic and materialistic, they assume that what describes everything else in science will describe us human beings too.
<br>
<br>
Determinism and Stochasticism are NOT born from a mere rejection of Christian metaphysics. They are born from science's dependence on mathematics to describe the world. Determinism was born in a time when the equations used were deterministic. Change the math and you change the philosophy, thus determinism becomes something else, Stochasticism?
<br>
<br>
At heart it's Occam's razor and naturalism at work. To suggest otherwise is to believe some bullshit religious propaganda. It's the acceptance of this naturalism that leads to the rejection, not visa versa.
<br>
<br>
What makes a choice "real" as opposed to "illusion" ? Does the 'reality' of a 'choice' necessarily mean we humans must leave the mathematical system that describes the rest of nature? Are human beings not mathematically describable? You have a sense that you can make a different choice, that you're "free" of something that constrains the unthinking world. Drop a rock from a tall building and it has no choice but to fall at 32 feet per second per second, just as Galileo's and Newton's deterministic formulas predict. Guess what; drop a human being from the same building along with the rock and they'll both hit the ground at the same mathematically predictable rate. Of course the human being will be screaming all the way down, flapping their arms and legs wildly, but the human doesn't seem to have much choice about not screaming (especially if you catch them by surprise) so I'm not sure that screaming is an act of free will. When they scream on the way down to their splattered destiny do they feel they have a "real" choice about screaming? 
<br>
<br>
So, our free will is constrained to a limited kind of action, we can't violate any laws of physics, we can walk and talk and throw things around but those actions too depend on physics. We can trace all those physical, materialistic, naturalistic processes all the way back to the brain. So, when, if ever, does the human system separate from the rest of the mathematically describable and predictable world? When does it become non-deterministic and non-mathematically describable?

<br>
<br>
I certainly do not imply any "theology" by positing the possibility of real free will.  If you read through what I have written, it should be clear that I posit entirely "materialist/naturalist" foundations.
<br>
<br>
To whatever degree we can see the universe as "mathematically explicable and conformable", that very mathematics tells us that QM-indeterminacy is a "real feature" of the landscape.  Mathematics tells us quite precisely when, where, and to what degree predictibility is possible.
<br>
<br>
Given a complete understanding of mathematical physics, we may be able to "deduce" precisely why the decay rate of Carbon 14 is the observed rate.  But it appears that that very same mathematics tells us we can never hope to take a given Carbon-14 atom and "calculate" that it will decay to Carbon 12 at 4:05 PM.  Furthermore, in a very fundamental way, it implies that the universe does not contain the state-information required to "cause" the decay at any given "point of time".
<br>
<br>
This is "Naturalism", not "Supernaturalism".
<br>
<br>
Humans may be 99.9% predictable, aggregate behaviors.  But humans also display an "unpredictability" to a degree not seen in any other species.  To me, this implies that our "brains" are capable of sensitivity to, and consequent amplification of, QM-indeterminacy in the "substrate".  That would not quite make us a "slave to randomness", since our systems have evolved to both filter "noise" and to cause "convergence to useful behaviors" (mostly).
<br>
<br>
Now, the question at hand is, do our minds simply "deal with the noise", as in operating mostly consistently _despite_ the noise, or has it actually found a way to "exploit" the noise to allow us to "originate a causal sequence" that was not itself subsequent to a strictly preceding "cause".
<br>
<br>
If the latter is true, it may well be amenable to "complete mathematical understanding".  That is NOT the same as "perfect predictability" in any isolated event.
<br>
<br>
(And if the possibility of free will "plays into the hands" of certain theologians, I am not going to let that stand in my way, as much as I might find their beliefs "bunkworthy".)

I think "s" was referring to "Brains are the best thing to give us that adaptability", as if without our brains, "we" would be less adaptable :)  But I understood your intent.  The evolution of "brain" affords a creature far more adaptability, especially in the short-term, than other faculties.
<br>
<br>
I might mention that "Godel's Incompleteness" is not quite the same as "QM Indeterminacy".  What Godel's theorem proves is that for any sufficiently expressive formal axiomatic system (in particular, a system in which recursive constructs can be defined), there will always exist more possible statements that can be expressed than the system is capable of reaching definitive answers for.
<br>
<br>
In short, the space of questions will be (infinitely) larger than the space of answers, thus there will be an infinity of "undecidable" issues.  In particular, ther will be "true statements" that cannot be proven to be true within that axiomatic system.
<br>
<br>
If the axiomatic system in question is itself formulated in a larger metasystem, the "unprovable statement" may be shown to be true, even though not provable in the sub-system (This is exactly how Godel constructed his proof).  But then, the metasystem is at least as expressive as the sub-system, and will have its own "universe" of undecidable propositions.  Thus, an infinite ascent of undecidable propositions is unavoidable in powerful axiomatic systems.
<br>
<br>
However, I do not precisely follow your statement:
<br>
<br>
&gt; "The determinism so important in brain function is not directly translatable to high-level functions."
<br>
<br>
Are you referring to the "reliability of chemistry" versus the "unreliability of thought"?

<br>
The electrochemical processes of our neurons function quite predictably and reliably. Our lives depend upon it every minute. What's more, to support any higher level functions, our neurons must work as dependably as a formal mathematical/logical system. That's where the determinism is to be found.
<br>
<br>
But by the time the mental functions operate on higher levels, determinism begins to collapse. Contradictions are introduced. Self-references appear. Processes (cognitive propositions) loose their absolute truth, provability, or even some of its decidability.
<br>
<br>
For example, take the sentence, "This statement is false." The quoted statement is not only contradictory, it is undecidable, much less unprovable.
<br>
<br>
My point is that human intellect wriggles free of the determinism that produces it--BY DESIGN. Certainly there are adaptations in all manner of species that render the individual more "fit" for its environment. Genetic information does indeed make the cheetah fleet of foot. But the information that yields the essence of adaptibility itself, will find fitness in a greater range of environments, especially those that change faster than genetic info can. That is the purpose of having neurons, to transcend genetic determinacy.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
I agree with your closing premise, which I take to be "self-directed intelligence and adaptability will surpass our genetic constraints, and is (thus) our "improved path" to continued evolution.
<br>
<br>
But I have to take issue with the way you portray nature or physics, as if they are (at basis) well-determined, or even amenable to logic.
<br>
<br>
The universe (the physics "out there") behaves exactly as it behaves, with no particular respect for logic or even a sense of "logic, avoidance of contradiction, etc."  Didactic logic, axiomatic systems, rule of the excluded middle (statement can be true, or false, and not both) are all mentally invented concepts.
<br>
<br>
The physics, per se, does not regard "rules" or choose to obey rules.  The physics has given rise to creatures (us) that can entertain "concepts", devise categories, and invent "rules" that we try to match to what is observed, and call these "models".  It is our "rule-making" (axiomatic systems) that we will not allow to have self-contradictions.  The universe does not care, and there is no rule THAT WE DO NOT IMPOSE OURSELVES that says the universe must be completely described by some system of knowledge that is free of contradictions.  Contradictions are "logical problems", not physical ones.
<br>
<br>
Most of the time, our (relatively simple) axiomatic theories do pretty well in matching physical observations, but that is because the things we tend to observe and explain are the "gross aggregate" qualities and quantities.  Indeed, nature holds quite reliably to conservation of momentum.  But when we try to place our axiomatic framework upon the wave-partical duality, nature thumbs her nose at us.  And at the QM level, she is anything but deterministic (by deterministic, I mean that the universe at time T has all the information and state necessary to completely determine the state at time T+1).
<br>
<br>
Rather than "our lives/minds depend upon the predictable and reliable neuron functioning", our functional success and rise to conscious thought occurs DESPITE irregular neural activity, thousands of neurons dying each hour, etc.  To hear you describe the determinacy of the chemistry, you would think that our brains are pentium processors (which are very UNLIKE our brains in that they DO need to function absolutely deterministically in order to "work"!)
<br>
<br>
And that should be a lesson for us, in our attempt to create strong-AI.  It cannot be so fragile that a logical flaw "matters critically", no matter where it might occur.  That would be like having one particular neuron "fail" in your brain, and suddenly you core-dump.  We operate despite the "noise", and I might conjecture, in part, BECAUSE of the noise.
<br>
<br>
Of course, there is no need to go to the other extreme, and have AI so closely match our biological-path to intelligence that it must entertain every form of delusion to which we are prone.  It can be more carefully engendered, "leaner and meaner", so to speak.  But when it is capable of rewriting itself to make its own self-improvements ... all bets are off!

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have maintained an aversion in all of my posts on this forum to a computer as my model for mental function. I agree our brains are quite robust in the face of events like neuron death, etc. All in all, they do have to get around to reliability or we begin to observe loss of function. That loss often proves fatal. 
<br>
<br>
The functions we see may be the result of aggregates, that same way air molecules bounce around on all directions, yet their sum holds up a balloon. Physicists don't like (or need) to account for each molecule to understand fluid dynamics. Neurons can cooperate, on balance, and organize themselves into increasingly larger groups. These groups tend to (co)operate in predictable, deterministic ways. There is no reason why that kind of determinism MUST survive in larger groups for higher-level functions.
<br>
<br>
It seems determinists in many colors would have us enchained by all kinds of forces that contribute so mechanically to every one our decisions. We must pursue our self-interests in an economically rational manner. Constant positive and negative reinforcement shape our behavior. We are slaves to our desires. Evolutionary psychologists say our very self-sacrifice is genetically encoded due to kin selection.
<br>
<br>
All of that is true'to a degree. It all guides us along the way. Although we may not be able to nullify gravity at will, we do have ways to adapt ourselves and our environment to make tools and to make an airplane. We have degrees of freedom. We still have to live with the consequences of our actions, but we have choices. We can ignore our own desires through deferred gratification. We have the capacity to suffer enormously to gain something higher. We can choose to die that others may live. We can jump out of a paradigm and look at what we are doing. We can think outside the box. We can learn and with knowledge comes the power to change.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I find the different opinions and theories of people posting here to be quite intriguing, and I can't resist jumping in. I am an outsider to the study of AI, please forgive me if I seem a bit ignorant of some of the principles involved. I am an EE, I have written a lot of firmware for embedded systems in the course of my career, so I do know a bit about computers. I stumbled onto Kurzweil's site through a link from an article I was reading (I had never heard of him before), and have been reading here for several hours. Fascinating!
<br>
<br>
First, I would like to comment that it seems most everyone posting here all agree with a common assumption that our brain (or a subset of it, as someone pointed out) is what *we* are. I would like to propose another assumption. It is that our brain is not what *we* are, but merely an interface between the universe of observable conscious mortality that we know, and the intelligence that exists in a sphere beyond what is observable in this mortal state that is really what *we* are; i.e. what *we* REALLY are is not observable in the mortal sphere.
<br>
<br>
I find it puzzling that so many of you are (apparently) so easily convinced that there is nothing more to us than what we are able to observe. Now, I certainly cannot offer any proof that there is more that we are unable to observe, but as an engineer and scientist, as I look back at history, I must conclude that it is quite likely that there is much pertaining to our conscious existence that we have not observed and are not aware of yet. Also, intuitively, as I sit here contemplating all of this, it seems quite obvious, even self evident, that there is more to *me*, my imagination, creativity, free will, than the relatively simplistic and somewhat deterministic interaction of the various chemicals, the molecules, the atoms, protons and electrons, that make up my body and my brain.
<br>
<br>
Many years ago, I am told, men believed that the earth was flat. The distant horizon is all that they could observe, and it certainly does appear to be flat. Later, they found out they were wrong, because they had trusted in only what they could observe. Some time after that, men believed in Newtonian mechanics. They thought the universe operated on these principles, and were arrogant enough to think that now they knew everything. Later, they found they were wrong, that there was much more that they had not been able to observe before.
<br>
<br>
As I sit here browsing and interacting with the internet, if I did not know better, I could easily conclude that all of the intelligence that is the internet was contained in my 802.11 modem. I unplug it and the internet dies, I plug it in and there it is. I cannot see any connection anywhere, therefore it must be contained within the modem, however in reality as we know, the modem is not the internet at all, but merely a conduit to it.
<br>
<br>
Why is it so hard to believe that our brains may be similar? Doesn't it seem very likely that our knowledge is based on what we can observe, and that maybe what we can observe is only a very small fraction of what is *really* around us, and what *we* really are?
<br>
<br>
It appears to me that computers are deterministic systems, with randomness injected. Nothing more. No matter how sophisticated our algorithms become, how complex the software, or how many computations per second the hardware can produce, it will always be nothing more than the deterministic interactions of inert matter. Yes, there may come a time in the not so distant future that computers are able to mimic strong AI, so much so that to us they may actually appear to be "alive". But they are not. They are still just inert matter, and always will be. Even as Kurzweil claims he is going to reverse engineer the human brain, it may be that he will never succeed in creating human consciousness in a computer, because what if the brain is not really the consciousness, but merely the conduit to it where it exists in a sphere that is not observable to the mortal body.
<br>
<br>
I know I really have no evidence for the theories I have posted here. But I hold it to be self evident, that myself, and I would hope other human beings, consist of something beyond the ever so complex organization of inert matter that is our bodies, something that will continue to exist even after our bodies have disintegrated.

<br>
<br>
Your point about not assuming that "all we can see is all there is" is a good point.
<br>
<br>
However, your assertion of a form of "metaphysical animism", something that "biological stuff" has, and "machines" cannot, is largely untestable, and hence  a bit irrelevant to the issues at hand.
<br>
<br>
As I have said before, the entire "observable" universe, you, I, garden snails and river rocks, could all be the hyper-dream of a 17-dimensional turtle sunning itself in a tide pool on Zeta-Prime.
<br>
<br>
If we cannot "know this", then it seves little purpose to wonder about it, (except for a bit of relaxation:)
<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, things can only be judged by the way they behave.
<br>
<br>
If we were to build "human-like" robots (think of Star Trek's "Data") and my child is swept into a raging river, and 9 of these robots stand there, while one risks its own destruction to dive into the river and save my child, then I know which robot I would want in my house ... and they could have their own room if they expressed such a desire.
<br>
<br>
Why attempt to make such a distinction between "inert" and "alive", or "calculating" and "thinking"?  What is the point, except as an element of pure philosophic debate?
<br>
<br>
What if we convince ourselves that "inert-machine-robots", no matter how highly evolved or sophisticated, cannot access that "beyond" you speak of, and yet it turns out that we are wrong?
<br>
<br>
Suppose we attempt to destroy or disassemble one of these "robots", and it "mimics" fear, and pleads with us not to destroy it.  We say "its just programmed to do that - its not really afraid - it does not really feel", but suppose we are wrong.  We would have destroyed a sentient being, merely out of our conviction that "it can't be like us".
<br>
<br>
We have little choice but to work from what we actually can observe.  We attempt to expand our horizons in the process, and discover along the way that the world is not so flat, after all.
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Good point Norm, in the last paragraph. This is a big gap in the logic of free will. It is too arbitrary and rigid. Analogous to your example is when a doctor hits your knee with a mallet. I don't think anyone would argue that the subsequent movement of your leg would be a conscious decision. But when a man murders someone, the blame is placed completely on him. Surely there is some middle ground between the two, I.E. a decision that is 50% free will 50% unconscious decision. I'm not even sure what it means for a decision to be a certain percentage of something, but then again I don't believe in free will. Anyway, free will does not allow for such situations. 
<br>
<br>
There is a similar problem with evolution. It is usually said that humans have free will; the rest of the animal kingdom does not. Does that mean that one of our common ancestors XXX years ago did not have free will, but her progeny did? That seems completely absurd.
<br>
<br>
Tony, you say there is indeterminacy and unpredictability that the 'old' determinism is not aware of? Good, that just bores another hole in the notion of free will. Conscious choice and randomness are opposites.
<br>
<br>
By the way, "my" determinism hinges on whether or not humans are to blame for their choices. I do not care about predictability or mathematical modeling. Maybe that is where I am misunderstanding the chaotic view?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Could you explain? I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I do think they are to blame on a certain level but it could be different from your view. Maybe my connotation of blame is different than yours. For example, if Joe kicks a soccer ball, he is to blame for kicking the soccer ball. If Lisa wins the Nobel prize, she is to blame for that. But her hard work, determination, and intelligence were actually caused by luck and chance rather than her own "will" (I'm still not sure what that means, exactly, other than being synonomous with the word "illusion"). It looks like it was caused by her will, because she made the decision to work hard, etc. But she made the decisions for a reason. She was in the right place at the right time, genetically and environmentally speaking. 
<br>
<br>
No, you say, there is more to it than that. She was the root cause of some of the decisions. Okay, imagine an exact simulation of Lisa's life. Let's say due to quantum indeterminacies, 50% of the outcomes had her win the prize, 50% had her doing something else (I don't think that alternate outcomes in the exact same universe are plausible, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt). I hope you see now that the outcome was determined by chance even if Lisa did seem to cause it.
<br>
<br>
I don't understand how quantum uncertainty works, I think that is my biggest problem. If in a comparison of two almost identical universes, if the uncertainties play out differently, how could the universes be considered truly identical? </p></td>

&gt; "Tony, you say there is indeterminacy and unpredictability that the 'old' determinism is not aware of?  Good, that just bores another hole in the notion of free will. Conscious choice and randomness are opposites."
<br>
<br>
Curious.  Certainly determinism and non-determinism (strong randomness) must be opposites.  Also, determinism and free-will must be opposites.  Thus for free-will and randomness to be opposites, we have a three-way set of opposites!
<br>
<br>
As there cannot (logically) be three opposite poles alng a single dimension, we are somehow involving an additional dimension of measure here.
<br>
<br>
&gt; "By the way, "my" determinism hinges on whether or not humans are to blame for their choices. I do not care about predictability or mathematical modeling. Maybe that is where I am misunderstanding the chaotic view?"
<br>
<br>
If free will really can manifest via "minds", it affects at most the "margins" of our activities (at least, most of the time.)  I would argue that 99.9% of our behaviors are "determined" by situations that are effectively beyond our control.  That is, we are "reacting" to the world, far more than "acting" upon it.  Effecting "choice", in the short term, is of little effect when your range of perceived options are sufficiently narrow.
<br>
<br>
The issue of "blame" is merely pragmatic.  If someone commits a "crime", we like to think they are "to blame" because that eases our conscience about "incarcerating" them.  (It NEVER justifies "vengeful punishment", which is self-defeating.)  However, whether they are really to "blame" for their decisions or not, we can be reasonably (statistically) sure that those who "act badly" are far more likely to "act badly again", thus incarceration (of some form or remediation) is demanded.
<br>
<br>
Formally, the issue of "chaos" (as in "Chaos Theory") is the study of purely deterministic systems whose complexities can give rise to behaviors that appear (mostly) indistinguishable from strong randomness.  These system exhibit the "statistics of randomness" in many measures, yet are not actually random.  They are very sensitive to small changes, and can amplify these to large effects over time, but NOT coherently (in contrast to an ordinary amplifier, where small changes are coherently amplified.)
<br>
<br>
If the chaotic system of "weather" were coherent/linear, and preventing a butterfly from flapping its wings this moment shifts the onset of a typhoon by 8 weeks and 800 miles, then waiting a few moments before interfering with the butterfly would shift the typhoon (perhaps) only by 7 weeks and 700 miles.  But theory indicates that the amplified change will not be smooth in this linear fashion.  One cannot "interpolate between" small initial changes, and expect the larger manifest effects to display corresponding interpolations.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, I believe the mind/brain structures act to amplify small effects coherently.  The issue of free-will surrounds the question of the origination of small initial effects, whether "mind" is akin to a quantum-object, a superposition of states that collapse to "choice" upon self-observation.  Circularity is inherent in this, but not (of necessity) a disallowed form of circularity (the kind that leads to self-contradiction.)

Without the power of choice, a person cannot be morally responsible. This is a legal defense. Someone who is "insane" is at the mercy of bad brain chemicals, or brain structure, or even bad blood chemistry, like low blood sugar. (This is the twinkie defense!)
<br>
<br>
Humans are genetically predispositioned to blame. We are predisposed to use reciprocal altruism and to seek retribution when social contracts are violated. This tendancy is to remove the profit from cheeting and increase the risk of disproportionate loss. Punishment that fails to achieve that is useless.
<br>
<br>
Determinists who discard free will must be prepared to replace the social fabric with compassionate rehabilitation of those whose behavior lessens the common good. They must view murderers as sick, broken people who need to be repaired, reconditioned, and healed. (See "A Clockwork Orange".)</p></td>

<br>
By the same logic, if the state imprisons and executes a convicted murderer, that is also a pre-determined action, so going to the trouble of tranquilizing and moving convicts is unnecessary.  Even a trial is unneccessary.  If I shoot the wrong guy...hey, it was predetermined.
<br>
<br>
If one takes this argument to the logical extreme, the very idea of moral choice is meaningless.  In the words of Hassan-i-sabah, "Nothing is prohibited; everything is permitted."  
<br>
<br>
By this logic, nobody can be held responsible for any act...from shoplifting to genocide.
<br>
<br>
It is possible to build a theory of free will that is strictly materialist--that doesn't require the human mind to be anything more than a mechanical process.
<br>
<br>
But if human free will is ultimately an illusion, it is certainly a useful one.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>A major source of confusion is the tendency to equate materialism/"mechanism" with "determinism".
<br>
<br>
Since most of the "machines" man has built (to date) rely upon gross aggregate behaviors, and thus obey predictable causal rules (steam engines, etc.,) we tend to think "mechanical = causal".
<br>
<br>
This "equation" is not longer an automatic given, once you build systems whose behaviors can be modulated by sensitivity to QM indetermincy, "tunneling", etc.
<br>
<br>
Of course, even if we were to agree that free will could be "real", the fact remains that most of our actions are so constrained by our environment (both the objective reality "out-there", and our ingrained ways of perceiving) that the issue of "blame" is generally inappropriate.
<br>
<br>
When someone behaves dangerously, violently, maliciously, etc., one need not "blame" them in order to be justified in acting to curtail their behaviors.  However, "punishment" (usually, "sense of satisfaction of giving pain-for-pain") is never warranted, and is largely self-destructive.
<br>
<br>
The "death penalty" is an ABOMINATION.
<br>
<br>
Its real "purpose" is one of three: 
<br>
<br>
(a) We are too cheap to fund minimal housing and care for this sick individual.
<br>
(b) It makes us "feel good" having killed them (restores cosmic/karmic "balance")
<br>
(c) "Their" side of the story is forever silenced.
<br>
<br>
In the first two cases, the attitude engenders further callousness in a population, and will likely lead to more cruelties down the road.
<br>
In the third case, well, you figure it out.

Here is a concrete example of determinism: A monkey sticks his hand in a fixed jar containing a cookie. The mouth of the jar is large enough to fit his open hand, but too small to fit the fist made when he holds on to the cookie. The monkey won't let go of his prize, so he is caught. Really caught by the determinism of his own desires. A human can now walk up to bind the monkey, even kill him.

Deferring gratification is an exercise of free will. We exercise free will in ordinary ways throughout every single day.</p></td>

The mouth of the jar is large enough to fit his open hand, but too small to fit the fist made when he holds on to the cookie. The monkey won't let go of his prize, so he is caught. Really caught by the determinism of his own desires. A human can now walk up to bind the monkey, even kill him.

<br>
<br>
I see where you're going with this, but I don't think this is *necessarily* an example of free will vs. determinism.
<br>
<br>
The monkey gets caught because his brain is not "wired" in a way that allows him to resolve the problem.  The jar with the treat in it is something that natural selection has not prepared him to handle.
<br>
<br>
No chimpanzee would be fooled by such a trap.  He would, after a couple of tries, walk over, find a rock, and then pound at the jar until he broke it and get the goodie out.  I believe that even a raccoon would probably figure out that he couldn't grasp the treat and get his hand out.  I live way out in the country, and there are raccoons all over the place, and I enjoy observing them.  They are tenacious and intelligent.  (I have yet to find a human container without a lock that a few clever raccoons can't figure out.)  A raccoon would look for an alternate strategy, and, failing that, give up.  Perhaps raccoons have free will, but I think it more likely that they are just smarter than the species of monkey in question.
<br>
<br>
Where we differ from the monkey is that we can reflect on our problems, and that's where I agree with you.  One fact from my 20+ years of researching "primitive" cultures that I think is very significant is that there is very little pathological behavior (addiction, insanity, violent crime) found in them.  But, like your monkeys, when humans encounter situations not covered in the original programming, so to speak, we respond with all sorts of self-destructive behavior.  Nicotine addiction comes to mind.  Any adult who continues to smoke is a lot like the monkey with his fist in the jar...in fact, he's worse off than the monkey, because he knows intellectually that his actions will probably cause him to die too young, and in horrible pain at some point down the road, while the monkey doesn't know that he's about to be harvested.
<br>
<br>
In 1939, the Austrian psychoanalyst Victor Frankl found himself in the middle of one of the most horrible experiments on human freedom ever conducted.  After the Nazis took over Austria, Frankl was taken to a death camp because he was a Jew.  There, he was made a slave laborer.  He was tortured.  German "scientists" performed experiments on him.  He was castrated.  But, because he was a physician, he was not put on the fast track toward the gas chamber, like so many others in the camp, because he was useful to his captors--he was, for a time the only M.D. there.  
<br>
<br>
All inmates were stripped of their dignity.  All veneer of normal human culture, let alone "civilization" was lost to them in very short order.  But Frankl observed that some of his fellow inmates succumbed faster than others to the death-camp experience..and he determined that it was not just physical strength that mattered...but the human will.  Frankl came to believe that, even though the Nazis had stripped him of everything--family, possessions, status, health, dignity--he still had enough freedom to determine, for himself, how he would respond to his situation.  In his book, "Man's Search For Meaning," Frankl writes that he came to believe that with this insight, he was, in fact, "freer" than his jailers.  In fact, Frankl came to believe that his free will was, in the end, the only thing that he possessed.
<br>
<br>
Was Frankl correct?  His insights are compelling, but, of couse, he could have been delusional.  Perhaps even in these extreme conditions, his reaction to the Nazis was strictly conditioned.  But I don't think so.

The free will difference between the monkey and the human is the degree of intelligence, and placing a Chimp between them matches both degrees. I concur natural selection did not "wire" the monkey to deal with his desire in that situation (a real one), and that IS the point of brains over determinism. Determinists say everything we do is the mechanical result of the expression of our desires; so we are not in control. My thesis is that our intellect is constructed as a tool to govern those desires. Intelligence can transcend destiny.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;Determinism itself removes blame from an individual because the individual is a victim of the deterministic causes that are actually in control. Without the power of choice, a person cannot be morally responsible. This is a legal defense. Someone who is "insane" is at the mercy of bad brain chemicals, or brain structure, or even bad blood chemistry, like low blood sugar. (This is the twinkie defense!) 
<br>
<br>
Determinism does NOT remove the blame from an individual in any way that could be used as legal defense.  This idea is absurd.  You are forgetting that the legal system itself is part of determinism, and punishment for breaking a law is a high probability.
<br>
For example, an individual has committed a crime.  Why did he commit the crime?  He found himself in a scenario where he could commit the crime and suffer the consequences (both anticipated and un-anticipated consequences), or he could not commit the crime and suffer a different set of consequences.  Determinism says that he chose the only choice he ever really had:  commit the crime.  In no way does this relieve him of any responsibility for the consequences, legal and otherwise of commiting the crime.
<br>
The scenario took place because of the complex cascade of events beginning with the big-bang that led all the way up to the situation in which he commited the crime.  Everything, from the consequences imposed by legal system, to the configuration of every particles in his brain, the crime scene, and the entire universe at the point in time where he consciously decided to commit the crime are relevant.  If an identical big bang were to take place, the exact same scenario would occur.
<br>
So why again did this man commit the crime?  Because after evaluating the scenario, his brain came to the conscious, or even unconscious decision that the alternative courses of action will make him worse off.
<br>
Just because we consciously experience free will doesn't make it non-deterministic.  Free will is determined by the influence our motivations have on all the possible choices we have available.  What determins our motivations?  The way our brain is biologically created + the sum of experiences and interactions we have with our environment.  All of these things are deterministic, but in no way relieves a man of responsibility for his actions :/

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Determinism denies morality. It says there are no real choices because of powers that act upon us lead us inexorably to certain behaviors. If we cannot do anything to prevent our own behavior, how can we be responsible? 
<br>
<br>
Behavioral psychology showed how we respond to rewards and punishments. This put a new face on determinism, whereby we act in accordance to our conditioning. We are all slaves to our conditioning and desires. It made some sense of a justice system that punishes crimes, while invalidating it in the same stroke. (Positive reinforcement, incentives, are more efficient than negatives.) It led to the view of the juvenile delinquent being a mere product of society, not responsible for its own depravity. Behavioral psychology supported rehabilitation and opposed retribution.
<br>
<br>
Legally, the difference between MURDER and INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is choice. If a person could not choose to kill, they cannot murder. A epileptic has a petit-mal seizure while driving and careens fatally into another person. It was the epileptic's acts which put the car in motion... Worse, an "insane" person is not even guilty, though conscious. It is because of faulty, deterministic processes in the kook's brain function that led to a lethal act. 
<br>
<br>
A determinist should ask what needs fixing. Inculcation cures errant cogitation? Fix the nut's brain chemicals, or (at some stage of neuro-science), the epileptic's brain structure. As all learned behavior results in a change in brain structure, new conditioning or direct surgery will cure it, right? Maybe, but which structure? Can it be permanent? New synapses continue to grow. The structure might regenerate later, short of a lobotomy.
<br>
<br>
I don't believe we make moral choices about every little thing in life. I do believe our species is genetically predispositioned--deterministically--to be moral and selectively altruistic. I think every nerve cell that contributes to adaptive behavior is determinism's way of transcending itself. As intelligence arises from this adaptive complexity, it trumps fate at every level.
<br>
<br>
So what is free will? I never said we are free from the consequences of our acts. Our actions are motivated by their expected consequences. We do have freedom to choose our motivations, and this is where I part company with the determinists. It should be plain to all that a given desire varies over time. Humans have the conscious power to suppress or express internal urges, the same way we ignore most things to focus our attention on the object of our contemplation. Even the most powerful instinct of self-preservation is subordinate to free will.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> I once defined "freedom as the absence of absolute knowledge. Many would define freedom as choice, but it seems that choice is the result, and not the definition of freedom. Whether freedom is a preexising state of the individual, or a universal condition that emerges from the chaos created by the entropy paradigm, I do not know.
<br>
<br>
 However, "free will" is activated by certain mechanical processes: we must have a nervous system that makes us seek to preserve and expand our lives, by avoiding danger, by sexual reproduction, by seeking to preserve our lives via religion so that we don't die, etc.
<br>
<br>
 In making such choices, we are embedded in a "sea" of complex reality and the choices of others, so that we must react to their choices as they react to ours in a kind of infinite regression.
<br>
<br>
 Ultimately, whatever choices we make, we know that we will die. It is likely that religion arose, along with philosophy, in an attempt to define "life after death".
<br>
<br>
 But this is derived from mechanical processes extended to an ever more complex level.
<br>
<br>
 What is not defined is, who is the "I" that makes the choices. This question also creates an infinity of answers so that our conceptual apparatus never despairs of possible answers.
<br>
<br>
 Godel's theorem shows that our thinki ng in such complex systems will remain incomplete, which leaves us with freedom but no way of arriving at an absolute answer, which makes "freedom" perpetual but in some ways negative. Chaitin has pointed out that in any axiomatic system there exists an infinity of undecideable propositions, so that we always face "reality" as individuals without solid guidelines.
<br>
<br>
 Freedom is, it would appear, the absence of absolute knowledge. However, choices other than those that best preserve our life and happiness, and our reproductive opportunities, would seem meaningless, or at least subject to infinite conceptualization , like ideas about "God".
<br>
<br>
 Yet freedom is meaningless without such speculation.
<br>
<br>
 In spite of our thoughts on freedom, we seem to conform to mathematical theorems, and we also seem to get caught in feedback loops like any computer, the difference being that we can separate or "exit the system" when necessary.
<br>
<br>
 But wouldn't we describe intelligence or self awareness as simply the ability to exit the system and not be subject to useless concepts? Ah, but which concepts are useless?
<br>
<br>
 Would that not require a guiding intelligence in some form? The mind cannot completely exit any system without ceasing to exist. Yet cesing to exist may be the only exit into that higher system of intelligence.</p></td>

Hey doojie, how's things-
<br>
<br>
Are you woundering if we can put to work a cause-effect?
<br>
<br>
Can we be the originator of so-called 'will'?
<br>
<br>
<br>
If so, i'd offer yes we can- although, i'd suggest that's what we are, it's not what we do.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
C
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-Is it possible to be of, (ourselves), or a party to being ourself.. or if it's clearer- (self-conscious/deliberate) of being ('will'/ourselves). 
<br>
<br>
That's to say, are we precisely depiction in &amp; of will?
<br>
<br>
If so..
<br>
<br>
-significant of this, and consequently.. can we without some sense of what (we 'will' be).. be the originator of (will/cause-effect)? 
<br>
<br>
In other-words, if i want to drive a FERRARI tomorrow, would i have had to driven one today to be a party to accomplishing this?
<br>
<br>
If we're original thought, then no- but it's good practice to cultivate feeling for what we suppose in bridging timeliness.
<br>
<br>
The gap of today and tomorrow, or significant PROGRESSION that is, i want to drive the FERRARI and tomorrow it is so, is supported by our surroundings, not impeded, to what we project or draw ourselves into being, or more accurately, to what is ourselves. 
<br>
<br>
Perceptable restrictions of freedoms and liberties are (our) employ of existing projections/PROGRESSIONS)?
<br>
<br>
If this is true as well, we simply need learn to accept what and who we are in bridging seperation of perceptable reality, or timely expression of ourselves.

"Are you (woundering) if we can put to work a cause-effect?

<br>
<br>
<br>
We can't be much of (wonderment) or expressive will, if we're walkin' around preoccupied with non-existent issues where none-exist in the first place.
<br>
<br>
We are free, to do as we 'will'. Given we allow this and understand the methodology of ourselves. The duality or depiction of conflict in and of MAN v. Society that we're riding is the stampede of superstitious practitioners.
<br>

<br>
"...we simply need learn to accept what and who we are in bridging seperation of perceptable reality, or timely expression of ourselves." -C

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think the problem lies in the fact that we put two terms ('free' and 'will') together that don't belong together.
<br>
"You're not here to make a choice, but to understand the choices you've already made."
<br>
People love the phrase "free will", because it makes their "will" the original cause (at least the original cause of their actions).
<br>
It would be more appropriate to say "free desire."
<br>
You see, it comes down to the notion of "becoming."
<br>
All of a person's actions derive from the notion of what they desire to become.
<br>
For example, a person goes to law school.  This is because they want to "become" a lawyer.  If I get thirsty, I take a drink of water. Because I want to become someone who is not thirsty.  All actions arise from this desire, to become.  But desire is only 1/2 of the coin.  The other 1/2 is identity.  The only difference between identity and desire, is identity is who I 'am' now, and desire is who I wish to 'become'.
<br>
This is important, because between the two, there is a feedback mechanism that gives rise to actions...
<br>
Consciousness is a strange attractor, an implicit infinite
<br>
One cannot 'create' consciousness, but we can create structures that become increasingly aware of it</p></td>
