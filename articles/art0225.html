<div class="TeaserText">From Silicon Valley via Aspen, Bill Joy wants to call the police. On science. On technology. On the industry that made him rich. The Left is OverJoyed.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published in <i>The American Spectator</i>, March 2001. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 25, 2001.</p>
<p>Ray Kurzweil's response to "Stop Everything...It's Techno-Horror!" can be read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011194209/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0226.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>"They say he's here."</p>
<p>"Who's here?"</p>
<p>"Bill, stupid."</p>
<p>"Bill's not stupid!"</p>
<p>"Hey, there he is. Amazing."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Where?"</p>
<p>"Over there. By the phones."</p>
<p>"Wow. They say he flew coach."</p>
<p>"Nah, he rode in on a donkey."</p>
<p>"But they say Reno and the feds will string him up. Klein claims he's a monotheist."</p>
<p>"Monopolist, you idiot."</p>
<p>"Anyway, forget Reno and Gates, think Joy. Joy is coded for bear."</p>
<p>For the last twenty years, whispering among the roseate wine glasses and murmuring amid the moist hors d'oeuvres at particularly palmy gatherings of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry-mostly in palatial oases in the Southwest, sustained by sylvan waters from Colorado and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> wafers from Taiwan-has soughed a high-voltage buzz of expectation. Would "he" really come?</p>
<p>In the past, "he" could mean only <a class="thought" href="entries/gates_entry.html">Bill Gates</a>. But stultified by the PR and legal departments of <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>, Gates no longer says anything interesting, even in his emails where he was once a pithy master of all too litigenic prose. For the last few years, the name most avidly anticipated at industry conclaves has been a man most readily summed up as the anti-Gates. His name is Joy, William F., reared in rural Michigan, catechized in Berkeley <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>, ascendant in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a>, and now orbited in Aspen as an industry saint and global positioning satellite.</p>
<p>A radiant figure in many ways outshining any other in the industry, Joy should be an arresting experience for the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. With gilded curls, cerulean eyes, soulful lips, elegant carriage, high above the herd, he could readily pass for any me-minded Hollywood coif, easily qualify for billboard displays of fashionable jeans or pheromones. At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, his serious intellectual attainments far exceed those on the short lists of recently newsworthy brains such as Gates, Nathan Myhrvold, David Boies, or Warren Buffett. Yet <i>People</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, the <i>NewYorker</i>, and other keepers of the celebrity canon have almost entirely missed him. That is about to change.</p>
<p>The story of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> age is epitomized far less by any of the usual stars or dot.cons than by <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, the ripely rich co-founder of <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>, now a $16 billion a year company that makes half of all <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. He was an architect of key <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> technologies, such as the Berkeley <a class="thought" href="entries/unix_entry.html">Unix</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>, its TCP-IP protocol stack, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/java_entry.html">Java</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. A curmudgeonly debating foil of Gates in the late 1980s, Joy was the most confident prophet and protagonist of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> regime that in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/java_entry.html">Java</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/applet_entry.html">applet</a>s broke through desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Most remarkable for a man long immersed in the intricate arcana of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, Joy is a voluble and polymathic intellectual. Joy has a law-"Most of the smartest people are never in your own company"-that inclines firms to create <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s open to the smart contributions of people outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> firewalls. But like logicians meeting the Cretan who declares all Cretans liars, few observers are inclined to take Joy's Law seriously at <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>, where everyone knows that Joy is the world's most ingenious <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er, most incandescent talker, and architect of some of the most significant technologies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. Just perhaps, if you have Bill in your company it is the other guys who have to worry about Joy's Law.</p>
<p>Remarkably enough, Joy hangs out in Aspen, Colorado, 1,500 miles from the nearest major Sun facility. By some reports he scarcely works for Sun at all and sold most of his shares in the company during an unbecoming snit a decade ago. He moved much of his money into <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>. This might have seemed smart early in the 1990s, but Sun shares have appreciated roughly three times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>'s since the emergence of Joy's own <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> technologies in 1995. So Joy escaped the multibillionaire status of his Sun cofounders such as Scott McNealy and <a class="thought" href="entries/khosla_entry.html">Vinod Khosla</a>. Still, by all normal standards, Joy is rich, and his insights have been fully vindicated by the emergence of the Web. Happily married with two engaging children, he has every <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to be deeply satisfied with his <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. And yet between the glitter and the gloaming lies a shadow of Aspen Angst.</p>
<p>On the wall of Joy's office (he dubs it Aspen Smallworks) is a poster identifying him as a founder of Sun. He is apparently proud of his role in the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> boom. Yet I am in Aspen this afternoon because of a strange and in some ways inspiring <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. Joy's anxieties have blossomed into a midlife metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Like <a class="thought" href="entries/einstein_entry.html">Albert Einstein</a> before him gazing into the Stygian inferno of nuclear portent, Joy has contem- plated a vision of harrowing peril for the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race. Like Einstein he longs to turn back the clock to more innocent Edenic days. But Joy's fear focuses not chiefly on the nuclear, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, and chemical weapons (NBC) that terrified previous generations. For all their danger, these technologies are <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible only to elites commanding costly and complex industrial powers and rare and unstable materials. Today the threat is far more insidious, elusive, and ominous. Through genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>), psychotic individuals, or merely negligent <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s, may have the power to devastate the globe with self-replicating plagues and "phages" that can devour the biosphere and end <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p>Joy published his alarm in the April 2000 issue of <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i> as an eloquent and stirring ten-thousand word personal testament that evoked more mail and comment than any previous article in the magazine (or in any other magazine in recent <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>). The article began by ascribing his new vision to a meeting with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> inventor and prophet Ray Kurzweil at the <a class="thought" href="entries/telecosm_entry.html">Telecosm</a> conference that Gilder Publishing runs with <i>Forbes</i> at Lake Tahoe every September. About to publish a book entitled The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, Kurzweil had argued that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s exceeding <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> were no more than a few decades away. With the advent of such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, he argued, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings would be faced with the stark choice of either being out-competed and driven to <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> by their own creations, or merging with them to produce the next <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary phase, a race of <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> robots.</p>
<p>Kurzweil is one of the great intellects of the industry, a pioneer of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/voice_recognition_entry.html">voice recognition</a> and vision. Coming from Kurzweil, what had previously seemed <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> now appeared to Joy as "a near-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> possibility," and evoked an epiphany.</p>
<p>Contemplating <a class="thought" href="entries/moravec_entry.html">Hans Moravec</a>'s observation that "<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> rarely survive encounters with superior competitors," Joy began re-examining his <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. He plunged into anguished rumination on his own role in this possible usurpation of his <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that he had done so much to advance. In almost three decades of being one of the world's leading designers of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>s Joy had never had "the feeling I was designing an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>." But now he felt obliged to consider that he might be "working to create tools which will enable the construction of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that may replace our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>." He was transfixed by the grim assessment of George Dyson in <i>Darwin Among the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</i>:"In the game of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, there are three players at the table: <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings, <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. I am firmly on the side of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. But <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, I suspect, is on the side of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s."</p>
<p>Kurzweil's argument, and now Joy's, drastically compressed and simplified, is that <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, which for almost 40 years has predicted the doubling of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power roughly every 18 months, is not going to expire later this decade as traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> manufacturing techniques hit the quantum barrier of near-atomic line-widths. Instead, Joy now believes that "because of the recent rapid and radical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s-where individual atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s replace lithographically drawn <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s-and related nanoscale technologies, we should be able to meet or exceed the <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> for another thirty years." The result would be <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s a million times as fast and capacious as today's <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s and thereby "sufficient to implement the dreams of Kurzweil and Moravec," intelligent robots by 2030. And "once an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> exists it is only a small step to a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>-to an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that can make evolved copies of itself."</p>
<p>Joy's nightmares do not stop with <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Intimately related are the very "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies" that may enable the extension of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> and genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Central to this <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">Genetics, Nanotechnology, Robotics</a>) trinity of techno-terror are two characteristics that could hardly be better calculated to inspire fear. The first is what Joy calls the "dematerialization" of the industrial power. In the past, you needed rare resources, large nuclear plants, and huge laboratories to launch a new holocaust. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> you will need only a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and a few widely available materials.</p>
<p>The even more terrifying common thread is "<a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>." As enormous computing power is combined with "the manipulative advances of the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s" and the revealed mysteries of <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, "The replicating and evolving processes that have been confined to the natural world are about to become realms of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> endeavor." New germs are self-replicating by definition. So too, Joy's "<a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>." And then there is the gray goo.</p>
<p>Joy's journey from his <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> throne to his current siege of Aspen Angst began in earnest when he encountered Eric Drexler's bipolar vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, with its manic-depressive alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s of utopia and dystopia. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> envisages the ultimate creation of new <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and materials, <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>. Joy enthuses about molecular level "<a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s" that "could make possible incredibly low cost solar power, cures for <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and the common cold...essentially complete cleanup of the environment.... Spaceflight more <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible than transoceanic travel today, and restoration of extinct <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>."</p>
<p>The nightmare is that combined with genetic materials and thereby self-replicating, these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s would be able to multiply themselves into a "gray goo" that could outperform photosynthesis and usurp the entire biosphere, including all edible plants and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. As Drexler writes:</p>
<blockquote>"Plants" with "leaves" no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough omnivorous "<a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>" could out-compete real <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>: They could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly and reduce the biosphere to dust in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop.... We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies.... [R]eplicators able to obliterate <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> might be less inspiring than a single <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of crabgrass. They might be superior in an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, but this need not make them valuable. [This] gray goo threat makes one thing perfectly clear: We cannot afford certain kinds of accidents with replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s.</blockquote>
<p>Contemplating this horrific prospect, Joy notes "it is most of all the destructive <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> of... [GNR] that should give us pause. It may even be that <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> may be more fundamental than we <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, and hence harder or even impossible to control."</p>
<p>As terrifying as all this is, Joy's nightmare has one more twist, which makes the threat all the more real to him, and now makes Joy himself fascinating to a number of people who previously showed no interest in spending their evenings with one more centimillionaire <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> nerd: "The nuclear, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and chemical technologies used in 20th century weapons of mass destruction were...developed in <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> laboratories," Joy notes. But <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies have "clear commercial uses." They are being developed by "<a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> enterprises" which will render them "phenomenally" profitable.</p>
<p>"In this age of triumphant commercialism...we are aggressively pursuing the promises of these new technologies within the now unchallenged <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of global <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> and its manifold financial incentives and competitive pressures." Quoting Green <a class="thought" href="entries/guru_entry.html">guru</a> Amory Lovins, who has become a close advisor, Joy laments that commercialization of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> "changes the goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary success to economic profit-to survival not of the fittest but of the fattest."</p>
<p>Joy, whose decades of unfettered <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ship have made him what he is today, has fingered the real culprits: <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a> and freedom. Fortunately he has the answer, which he delicately phrases as "<a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a>" of key <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">Relinquishment</a>-for the hard of hearing-means what it seems to mean: to give up; forgo; abandon not only the use of such technologies but even the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> that might enable them "to limit the development of the technologies that are too dangerous, by limiting our pursuit of certain types of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>."</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">Relinquishment</a>"" has a voluntary air. Joy offers a certain amount of mummery about "a new Hippocratic oath" placing merely self-imposed ethical limits on <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. But he is not so gullible as to believe evil can be combated with pleasantries. Joy's <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> of comprehensive <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> intervention goes beyond the negligent or criminal use of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to embrace an avowedly massive regime of surveillance and regulation of businesses that have, might have, or might someday develop <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> capabilities.</p>
<p>As Joy points out, punishing techno-crimes after the fact is not sufficient when the stakes are global destruction. The state must become concerned before the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> occurs.</p>
<p>Because <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies, in some form, will engage most leading-edge commercial enterprises, such prior restraint would entail <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> powers unprecedented in the U.S. Joy is undaunted:</p>
<blockquote>"Verifying <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> will be a difficult problem, but not an unsolvable one." The major task, he explains, will be to learn how to apply the techniques for verifying arms treaties (i.e., massive <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, inspection, and policing efforts) "to technologies that are naturally more commercial than <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>. The substantial need here is for transparency, as difficulty of verification is directly proportional to the difficulty of distinguishing relinquished from legitimate activities."</blockquote>
<p>Just so, since Joy's fear arises in the first place from the belief that anyone-or any business-with <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and a few "commonplace materials" can become a source of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> terror. Assuming any citizen or company could be doing <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> in the basement implies "a verification regime...on an unprecedented scale. This, inevitably, will raise tensions between our individual privacy and desire for proprietary <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and the need for verification to protect us all. We will undoubtedly encounter strong resistance...."</p>
<p>Returning home after the interview, I inadvertently press the erase button on my new <a class="thought" href="entries/sony_entry.html">Sony</a> recorder, an elegant little shell-shaped <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that uses <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> "<a class="thought" href="#">flash</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>" rather than tape. The interview indeed vanished in a "<a class="thought" href="#">flash</a>." This awesome <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> proceeds to erase hours of work trillions of times faster than it could have been removed from a normal tape cassette. Was this a symbol of the devastating power of new technologies? Joy seems to believe that some delusional maniac or evil enemy could press the erase button on his <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>- perhaps even by mistake-and delete the American biosphere.</p>
<p>The spectacle of one of the world's leading techno-<a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s offering himself as the prime witness for the prosecution against his own class is transforming Joy into a celebrity intellectual and political force. He was chairman of President Clinton's <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Advisory Committee and a friend and advisor of Al Gore, whom with his friend leading <a class="thought" href="entries/venture_capital_entry.html">venture capital</a>ist <a class="thought" href="entries/doerr_entry.html">John Doerr</a>, he endorsed for president during the campaign. He is being noticed outside the industry. The <i>NewYorker</i> should arrive soon.</p>
<p>Glomming on to Joy's tract as if hugging a redwood is the collective green goo of the gonzo reaches of environmental movement. The Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resource Defense Council-nearly the entire technophobic Green <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is poring through this document as a white paper flag of capitulation from the midst of the enemy camp. It has been mass distributed at tony wasp prep schools and earnest ivied campuses. It has been solemnly contemplated on both coasts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> from Charlie Rose to CNN. Its author is coming to a screen near you.</p>
<p>Counseling the new Joy is Amory Lovins, the conservationist, whom Joy first got to know well at an Esalen workshop. Included in the <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i> article was a Lovins sidebar issuing a grim warning on the dangers of bioengineered foods. Opposition to these foods is almost totally devoid of empirical scientific grounding; some 60 percent of the packaged food in America is bioengineered in one way or another. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to feed the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> it will be necessary to exploit this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> aggressively. But Joy seems convinced. Biofoods will have to submit to what is termed the "cautionary principle," where small risks of huge catastrophes dictate <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> of "reckless schemes."</p>
<p>Lovins is the reigning Tiger Woods of political correctness. A heterosexual white <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a>, he somehow made it through the intensely competitive opening rounds of the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> tournament (a putative elimination <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> run by the <i>New York Times</i>) by joining a gaggle of Native American potters and <a class="thought" href="entries/mud_entry.html">mud</a> sculptors, lesbian "breath" poets and performance artists, and other <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary dismal scientists as a MacArthur <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">Genius</a> (a feat as amazing as Brent Barry winning the NBA dunking contest in 1996). Lovins then showed his real <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> mettle by taking the Heinz, Lindbergh, World <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>, and Heroes for the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">Planet</a> awards, before capping it off with the Mitchell, Nissan, Onassis, and Alternative Nobel prizes. Only the wrong Pope kept him from beatification.</p>
<p>Under the influence of such alliances, Joy's concerns careen off to embrace the entire litany of environmental catastrophism, from <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> to Faustian biofoods, that animates the anti-capitalist <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. But though his new allies may not yet realize it, Joy is leading them, resetting their agendas. For wittingly or not, Joy has unveiled what will be the 21st century's leading rationale for anti-capitalist repression and the revival of statism, a tonic for beleaguered socialists, a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and <i>raison d'etre</i> for a new New Left.</p>
<p>Like the industrial age socialist left, the Techno-Left targets a bourgeoisie of <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s and technologists, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s, glorying in anarchic freedom, driven by the lust for profit, and threatening to destroy mankind. To thwart the self-indulgence of this techno aristocracy-successors of Marx's commercial and industrial aristocracy-there must be a new dictatorship of a new proletariat, with the power to bind the <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s to the service of the common good.</p>
<p>Even as the 19<sup>th</sup>-century socialists flirted with liberty, Joy wistfully avers his fondness for libertarian thinkers like Robert Nozick and his concept of a limited state. But at crunch <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> Nozick, and liberty, are dismissed as indulgences. The real <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> the Green left has adopted Joy with such enthusiasm is that Techno-Horror is about to become the trump card in a bid for power as dramatic and far reaching as the socialist claims on the wealth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a>.</p>
<p>If envy drove the socialist argument, the drive for power of the new Techno-Left is fueled by fear. As George Bush noted in accepting the GOP nomination last summer, the <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of the 21<sup>st</sup> century will be largely a struggle of fear vs. hope, cowering vs. <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>.</p>
<p>The great insight of the Green left has been that in an era of almost universal prosperity-except in socialist countries-neither envy of the rich nor compassion for the poor would sustain the leftist cause. The Greens opted instead for fear induced by the phantasms of phony <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. But the Greens by themselves are doomed to be a mere transitional movement between the industrial age socialist left and the 21<sup>st</sup> century Techno-Left.</p>
<p>Green fears, on the whole, are too easily resolved. Real pollution, from smog to strip mines, can be and largely has been swiftly dealt with at surprisingly modest costs. Facing overwhelming evidence that technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and economic <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> are favorable to the environment, the Greens have enlisted trial lawyers in the cause who have helped generate more junk <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and phony fear than the Soviet Academy under Stalin. But the effort wears thin. The California <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> crisis will make all too many people realize that "efficiency" and "alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s" translate as "turn off the lights." Environmental good news could be as devastating to the Greens as <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> was to the socialists. With the U.S. environment so manifestly cleaner and more robust today, Greens have had to put ever more far-fetched threats on stage to get a reaction.</p>
<p>Especially apt for the <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a> of fear are threats deemed sudden in their onset, irreversible in their impact, and unverifiable in advance. Typical are exponential processes which, as eco-catastrophists often point out, are nearly undetectable until they virtually take over. Think of lily pads, doubling every week. Just a month before they take over the pond, they still cover only a cosmetic one-sixteenth of its surface. From this point of view, <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> is a perfect kind of threat, particularly in the form proposed by Joy, where it might be masked for years by the onset of a new ice age also precipitated by a global <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-dioxide buildup. "It's non-linear; it could tip either way." <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> climate models trump all the physical evidence that temperatures were two degrees higher a thousand years ago during the so-called Medieval Climate Optimum, and are now merely recovering from the throes of the little ice age of mid-millennium.</p>
<p>Yet even better than <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> is the Joy-Drexler-Lovins, <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> trinity of Techno-Horror. It will propel the Techno-Left into the vanguard, allowing it to absorb the Greens and become the main adversary of freedom and faith in this century.</p>
<p>Pervasive among both the proselytizers of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>'s promise and its prophets of doom is a mindset now morphing into a nascent <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, a loose weave of assumptions and ideas that claim the authority of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> without its rigor or depth. Call it the Virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> or Virtualosophy.</p>
<p>A combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> regimes, <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> theories, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a>s, self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> visions, ecological idioms, and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_theory_entry.html">information theory</a>, the Virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> is seriously taught or even understood in no major university. Perhaps its leading source is an intellectual Esalen called the <a class="thought" href="entries/santa_fe_institute_entry.html">Santa Fe Institute</a>, where <a class="thought" href="entries/kauffman_entry.html">Stuart Kauffman</a> has recently expounded it in depth in a book called <i>Investigations</i>. Yet it powerfully shapes the conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> and ersatz worship of the emerging intelligentsia of the Web and hence of the ascendant new American culture. Al Gore has espoused many of these themes from <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and invoked them in his book <i><a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a></i><i> in the Balance</i> and in an interview in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i>.</p>
<p>The Virtualosophy is driven by a curiously powerful and seductive faith. In their manic phase, Virtualosophers believe that the cyber world is capable of practically and predictively replicating the essential processes of the physical world, including creation and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. But this is a bipolar sect, and it also has a depressive phase in which its proponents are appalled at what they have persuaded themselves is their all-but infinite power over the world. Then they wake up screaming.</p>
<p>In ancient Greece, Idealist philosophers taught that the world of the senses was an illusion and that the highest realities were mathematical. Strange as this notion seems, the Idealists were not fools or charlatans. Pythagoras and Euclid, Zeno and Parmenides were on a natural high, enraptured by the discovery that so much of reality could indeed be described according to recurring mathematical rules. In a famous essay of the 1960s entitled "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">Mathematics</a> in the Natural <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>s," Eugene Wigner of Princeton expounds the same astonishment.</p>
<p>In a materialist era, the notion that a logical or mathematical idea of the world is more real than its physical manifestation seems so odd that most people who slip into idealism seem unaware of it. These same scientists often imagine themselves to be materialists. But idealism is pervasive in modern <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, not by modeling the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> but by presuming the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> must be a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in a different medium, was at <a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a> an idealist notion. So is the complete takeover of theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, a takeover that led quantum theory for decades into a surreal cul-de-sac occupied by multiple parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s. This pursuit rendered most theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> incoherent and essentially useless for describing reality.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in Drexler's <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> is more <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, or cyber-fiction, than <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a>s abound in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models. As in the venerable and still expanding <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> game of "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>"-now reborn in sophisticated form as Tom Ray's ingenious "Tierra"-<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> seems routine. Based on a few simple rules, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> enthusiasts create two dimensional cyber creatures that seem to evolve robustly. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models similarly make the construction of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s look feasible if not easy. But there are, to date, no <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s. Indeed, the curious fact about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologists is that they are relatively uninterested in real technologies, such as microchips and micro-<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (<a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a>) that actually work. Instead they prefer the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> of a godlike assemblage of a new creation, with new <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>s.</p>
<p>When you are a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nerd_entry.html">nerd</a>, the world looks like a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. At the heart of the Virtualosophy is a vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> that only a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist could believe. In a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> model <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> looks easy, and fast. In the canonical texts of the Virtualosophers, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is a universal solvent in the tides of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, proceeding raptorially, altruistically, collaboratively, individually, incrementally, saltantly, emergently, symbiotically, with collective effects that transcend intention or sum of parts. Not only living biotic entities, but cultural forms, <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s, memes, models, <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, ideas, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> are swept into the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary swell with <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, bears, and humans.</p>
<p>Central to the belief that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models may be better at <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> than the natural world are so-called cellular automata, conceived by John Von Neumann, that simulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that prove their fitness by surviving a contest among "<a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s" in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>. Effective for some specialized purposes (sorting <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, for example), <a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">genetic algorithm</a>s, cellular automata, and other self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s have spurred belief in a much swifter and surer form of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> than is possible through a process of chance mutations.</p>
<p>Over several decades, for example, the mathematician Stephen Wolfram, a father of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_theory_entry.html">chaos theory</a> and titan of Virtualosophs, has worked out a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of simple rules which, <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> loose in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> model, will replicate, he believes, all the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> patterns from which the physical world is constructed: Creation as <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> game. To Wolfram, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is so easy it does not even require natural selection; any form of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> that is physically possible will emerge. His great breakthrough in model building was to depart from two-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models like "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>" and proceed, not to three dimensions as one might expect if the goal is to model the physical world, but back to one, because it made the models more coherent.</p>
<p>None of the stunning technological achievements of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> age, however, have been the result of a retreat from the physical world. Though we may have overthrown <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the economy, we did so by unlocking its mysteries in a process deeply empirical and profoundly physical. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> prevails only because the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> from which microchips are made is now the most profoundly studied manufacturing material in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the world, and most of what we know was gleaned from actual manufacturing experience.</p>
<p>Both the dreams and nightmares of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-from <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cures to gray goo-spring from the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>-lite. Generating superior forms of pseudo <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in hours not eons, cyber-Darwinian magic can overcome all the shortcomings of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> designers. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will not be designed, they will evolve, in effect designing themselves through interactions based on a few simple rules.</p>
<p>But this siren lure of bottom-up <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> contradicts all the experience of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> design. Looking for examples of mindless <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, one would not readily adduce a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, designed by industry demigods John Von Neumann, <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, executing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s authored by Tom Ray or Per Bak. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is one of the world's most manifestly designed and intelligently architected <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. Comprising many hundreds of layers of elaborately deposited and etched materials in amounts and patterns of exquisite precision, the microchip is necessarily a top-down design. The ideas that guide its architects are its essence. This is precisely the opposite of the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary notion that well-ordered, functioning organisms arise spontaneously as a function of interactions of the underlying material <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s.</p>
<p>In the real world, Darwinian <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is made plausible by the interaction of nearly infinite possibilities over nearly infinite <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, entailing physical, chemical, and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes still little understood and vastly more challenging than anything in a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>ie's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> model. As <a class="thought" href="entries/kauffman_entry.html">Stuart Kauffman</a> himself concedes in his book, "The strange thing about <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is that everyone thinks he understands it. But we do not. A biosphere or econosphere, self-consistently co-constructs itself according to principles that we do not yet fathom." Yet the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>ies not only propose to match <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but actually fear exceeding it by accident and destroying the world. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> wants to have it both ways. Joy and Drexler imagine that, through deep understanding of the underlying rules of natural selection, we can hasten <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Then when this strategy fails, as it does, they fall back on an almost mystical belief that understanding how <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> works is irrelevant because the models can evolve without our intervention.</p>
<p>The fear of a scientific concoction that escapes the laboratory, perhaps through a porous <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen, emerged in literature in Kurt Vonnegut's <i><a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">Cat</a>'s Cradle</i>, which evoked the pandemic menace of Ice-9. Contrived for the Pentagon by chemist Felix Hoenikker in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to save Marines from the indignity of marching in <a class="thought" href="entries/mud_entry.html">mud</a>, Ice-9 stiffened at room temperature. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s had somehow found a way to link up in a crystalline solid at temperatures where other water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s were in liquid phase. Loosed from the lab, Ice-9 would spread rampantly until all rivers, lakes, oceans, and ultimately <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> creatures froze up.</p>
<p>No real scientist, mad or malevolent, ever made any real Ice-9. But the concept of a new <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> that outperforms the real chemicals of the biosphere and chokes off all <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has intoxicated scientists and pseudo-scientists for decades. In the late 1960s, a Soviet physicist named Yuri Deriabin wrote an article describing his success in creating a new form of polymerized water-polywater-that could suffocate the biosphere under a gray goo if it escaped from the lab. The canonical <i><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i> magazine published the alarm as a cover story and discussed it solemnly in several issues. Meanwhile at Caltech, a student of the eminent <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a> followed directions and created some of this doomsday gel. A few pertinent tests revealed that the strange <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> was merely a mixture of H20 with silica dissolved from the surface of the delicate quartz capillaries in which the substance was condensed.</p>
<p>Last summer at Brookhaven National Labs, a similar panicky pother, also respectfully vented in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a></i>, erupted over another projection of faulty <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. In this case the fear was that the bombardment of gold nuclei in an ultrarelativistic two-way, two-mile-long subterranean tunnel would create <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of a mass and density tantamount to a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> that could suck up the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> in a nano-nonce. In due course, the alarmists were subdued, the experiment proceeded, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> yawned, having experienced innumerable events far more cataclysmic during its billions of happy years smashing things together.</p>
<p>Ice-9, polywater, <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s, gray goos, nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/replicant_entry.html">replicant</a>s, pico piranha, and many concoctions to come all seem catastrophic in callow <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models.</p>
<p>Although the schemes claim to be "genetic" or "<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary," they fall short by many billion years of the pullulating astronomical ebullition and churn of real physical <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. After eons of cosmic tempest and bombardment and tatonnement, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> has seen and done it all: everything that <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> can offer. As Kaufmann argues, physical phenomena are not deterministic. Even well above the quantum level, the degrees of freedom in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> are infinite, and it is impossible to shield our creations from the eternal bustle and commotion of numberless forces and energies. As a result, the ecosystem is neither fragile nor stable. It is both more robust and less predictable than the Virtualosophy can grasp in its preoccupation with our puny mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s and gray goos. If water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s possessed a lower <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> polymer form readily <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible to graduate students and a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> could be concocted in galacticly feckless supercolliders, we would certainly not be here to tell the story.</p>
<p>The Virtualosophers babble about "<a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>" and purport to believe in material <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but they in fact believe in virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. They show scarcely an inkling of the cosmic multidimensional dynamics of mazes on exponential mazes, beyond all ken of conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, that they pretend to master with their "simple rules," <a class="thought" href="entries/state_machine_entry.html">state machine</a>s, and cellular automata.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> offers no rationale for surrendering the principles of a free society and burking scientific inquiry for fear of its yield. But the answer to Joy's fears, and his totalitarian temptation, is not to deny their possibility. It is impossible to prove a negative and some of his fears, like the possibility of a genetically manufactured runaway plague, are not only plausible but present dangers.</p>
<p>Apparently eradicated by a global effort thirty years ago, smallpox is still extant as a result of a Soviet bioweapons campaign. In the face of the usual treaties, the Soviets produced reputed tons of the substance while the world was largely disposing of its vaccines. Richard Preston of the <i>New</i> <i>Yorker</i> last year wrote a harrowing and prizewinning article on the subject. In charge of the effort to defend us from such plagues for much of the last decade-it may not reassure you to learn-has been Donna Shalala of the Department of Health and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Services in Joy's favorite administration, which has kept its eye instead on the greater threat of sexism. Joy could perform a vital role in attacking the world's curious insouciance toward the continuing bio-war preparation of Saddam Hussein. But instead of fostering a resolute response, targeted on real threats, he disperses his fear indiscriminately among the politically correct targets and thus spreads panic and confusion.</p>
<p>The ultimate answer is that if Joy's policies prevail, his fears will reliably come true.</p>
<p>In Joy's mind <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> abuses of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> are not the main threat. After all, as the Cold War itself showed-though Joy nowhere concedes the point-deterrence is a robust defense. Joy's concern, the democratization of terror, is with terrorists, psychopaths, or more or less innocent accidents by perhaps negligent <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s.</p>
<p>But in the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> of such an unplanned bio-catastrophe, we would be far better off with a powerful and multifarious biotech industry with long and diverse experience in handling such perils, constraining them, and inventing remedies than if we had "relinquished" these technologies to a small elite of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> scientists, their work closely classified and shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>Contemplating a similar scenario, nuclear physicist Edward Teller famously compared the contributions to U.S. security of the nuclear industry, long draped in nearly impenetrable secrecy, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry, open to the world. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry has advanced literally thousands of times faster than the nuclear industry and the security of the U.S. is increasingly based on it. Desert Storm was devoid of nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> but replete with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> advances. Joy would shroud advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in the kind of secrecy currently afflicting nuclear weapons, or perhaps even forbid further <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> altogether, since every step forward would bring us closer to the <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.</p>
<p>Socialism and secrecy do not outperform freedom, even in the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> realm, even in otherwise capitalist countries. The Manhattan Project was a brilliant exception, but it succeeded chiefly because of wartime suspension of the normal immigration and security rules (without immigrants from Europe, many of them Communists or Communist sympathizers, the <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> bomb, the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> bomb, and intercontinental missiles could not have been created in the U.S.). The key to the success of the project was Robert Oppenheimer's rejection of the advice of General Leslie Groves that the venture proceed in uncommunicating modules with no one knowing what others were doing.</p>
<p>The secret and essentially socialized U.S. nuclear and missile industries bogged down in bureaucracy and could not even keep pace with the Soviet Union. In the 1950s the Soviets launched <a class="thought" href="entries/sputnik_entry.html">Sputnik</a>, a world-leading submarine fleet, and intercontinental ballistic missiles, while the U.S. fell pathetically behind. It was chiefly the free and open <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry that allowed MIRVing and <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> of warheads for lower power rockets. It was the free and open <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s industry that gave ultimate superiority to the U.S. and enabled victory in the Cold War. The pullulating rivalry of technological enterprise, inimitable by any totalitarian state no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how many secrets it steals, is the best guarantor of American security and safety in the face of the unique perils of the new century.</p>
<p>The answer to Joy's dilemma comes in Joy's Law. We will best meet the coming menace of demonic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> by opening it up to contributions from smart people everywhere rather than by relegating it to a small elite of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> experts. We will be safest when as many people as possible understand the peril and address it with a wide range of approaches. If we outlaw <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> will be restricted to outlaws and a few scientists at the National Security Agency and FBI. If <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> is legal, the outlaw experts will be vastly outnumbered by scores of thousands of honest practitioners and <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> breakers. If we ban <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>, only outlaws and rogue states will command the capability. We can prevail over the danger when outnumbering the handful of psychotic or coerced and closeted <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s are hundreds of thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ially organized scientists.</p>
<p>Joy now joins Lovins in lamenting that biotech and other 21st-century technologies are being driven by "economic profit." But economic incentives, which Joy would amplify by insurance requirements, ensure that the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be understood by hundreds of thousands of people. By promoting diverse and prosperous <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> industries rather than creating a <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>-run monoculture in the field, the U.S. will have a good chance of meeting any threat from the underground.</p>
<p>Joy's self-defeating scheme of creating a national security state to halt dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> would end up repressing the very efforts required to overcome the dangers. In a capitalist democracy the mob is ultimately on the side of good. It is the bias toward collective benefit on the part of millions that accounts for the success of the race in overcoming all the previous crises it has encountered and the crises that Joy rightly deems possible in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>At any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, a projection of the dangers and impending scarcities would have shown the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> enterprise untenable. It is an essentially religious faith that the world makes <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> which underlies all scientific and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. But Joy comes from a culture that is adamantly blind to the ethical and epistemological contributions of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>.</p>
<p>The Virtualosophistic world view renders <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> accidental, unlikely, and sure of a bad end. Scientists today are very confident that they can do without <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. But without <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> they panic about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> and like Joy can find no answer but brutal exertions of power to terminate the uncertain bounties of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>. Seeing that <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is a domain of chance, they wish to bring it to a halt. Seeing that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> cannot prove a negative-guarantee that some <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> will not cause a catastrophe-they insist on a "cautionary principle" for new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that would not have allowed a caveman to build a fire. Seeing that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> cannot assure safety they believe that the endless restlessness and <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings is a threat rather than a solution.</p>
<p>To the religious person, however, chance is not the realm of the anarchic and haphazard, dominated by the depredations of the mob, but the arena of freedom and the crucial condition of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>. Bottom-up freedom and emergence flourish in an environment of top-down law and transcendent <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, a monotheism that removes the arbitrary from <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and denies the dominance of evil in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the "mysterious" realm that Einstein called "the cradle of all true <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> and true <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>" chance is beyond the ken of inductive <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. When Albert Hirschman writes that "<a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> always comes as a surprise to us," he is acknowledging this essential property of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>. Any effort to reduce the world to the dimensions of our own present understanding will exclude novelty and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. The domain of chance is our <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to futurity and to providence. "Trusting to chance" seems terrifying, but it is the only way to be open to possibility.</p>
<p>As one of us wrote in <i>Wealth</i><i> and </i><i>Poverty</i> twenty years ago, "modern <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is hopelessly contingent and problematical, subject to destruction any day by possible climatic reversals, astrophysical mishaps, genetic plagues, nuclear explosions, geological convulsions, and atmospheric transformations-all conceivable catastrophes originating beyond the ken of plausible remedy or control."</p>
<p>If we try to battle all these threats at once, and non-threats like <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> and PCBs as well, we will end up wasting all our wealth on windmills, strewing them across the California environment, or tilting with them like Don Quixote. We will resort to ever more stifling controls that will suppress the unexpected boons of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> which have always been the source of our prosperity and success. We will invest in problems rather than in opportunities and end up without either wealth or freedom, facing the ultimate problem of demoralization and sclerosis.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race has prevailed against the plagues and scarcities of its past, not through regulation or "<a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a>" but through <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and faith. It is chiefly when we give up on chance and providence, and attempt to calculate and control our destinies through a demiurgic state, that disaster occurs. It is chiefly when we regard the masses as a mob of mouths, accidentally evolved in a random <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, that evil seems inevitable, good incomprehensible, and tyranny indispensable.</p>
<p>State planning killed close to a billion people in the 20th century. Led by the banning of DDT, the resurgence of malaria, the suppression of nuclear power, and the retardation of global <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, environmentalist excesses have already killed more people than environmental pollution ever did. From the ecological wastelands of the USSR to the continuing "tragedies of the commons" where property rights are denied, the kind of regulation and repression that the Virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> fosters poses the gravest threat of all. State control and tyranny block off the myriad emergent initiatives and feedback loops and acts of faith that have always enabled <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings to prevail under conditions of freedom.</p>
<p>Now amid many assurances that he believes in market solutions, Joy is creating an atmosphere in which the environmental movement will be ceded the power to veto and regulate new technologies, in which small commissions of politicized scientists will govern the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of crucial <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s, in which advocates of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>-mandated conservation will trump the pioneers of <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and enterprise.</p>
<p>From Joy's Aspen office I gaze at the silvery vista of mountains, skies, and skiers that has attracted some of the world's richest and most illustrious hedonists to this once humble mining town in a remote valley of Colorado. When you live in Valhalla, the rest of the world-all those smart people who are not in your own company and who seethe with resentments and option envy, who have to inch their way to work down Route 101 in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> or 90 in Boston or Seattle-may seem part of a potential mob. All those Berkeley brains and dissidents who did not come to work for Sun. What are they doing in their cramped garages and basement laboratories or remote rural cabins? Theodore Kaczynski was one of them- a graduate student at Berkeley before Joy, studying some form of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> so abstruse as to be of no commercial interest, stalking away from <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> with a migrainous grudge. Imagine the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a> as a biotech wizard, contriving deadly infectious potions. Joy has. As he points out, "We're lucky Kaczynski was a mathematician rather than a molecular biologist."</p>
<p>Joy, perhaps the world's leading technologist, would have been an obvious target for the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a> after the crippling and near murder of Joy's friend, Yale writer, artist and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> pioneer <a class="thought" href="entries/gelernter_entry.html">David Gelernter</a>. It is not easy for Joy to find any redeeming insight in the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a>'s screed. But in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i>, Joy quotes Kaczynski as if he were more than a demonic scrivener, and now Joy has become the inadvertent vessel of the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a>'s unexpected but sweeping triumph. For not only does Joy respectfully quote the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a> at length, in the end he adopts the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a>'s stance toward <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Kaczynski could hardly have dreamt of a better outcome for his own campaign for <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> than its adoption by his most eminent Berkeley successor, who also left <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Bay for a retreat in the mountains.</p>
<p>Toward the end of Joy's article, however, he abandons the tactics of terror and the intimidation used by the <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a> to secure support and he appeals for an ethical foundation. Groping for a <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> without firm moral codes, he turns attentively toward the East and the Dalai Lama. The Buddhist leader taught him the futility of wealth and the need for a <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of "altruism" alien to what he found in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the story of Siddhartha resonates with Joy. The original Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, was an eminent rich man who discovered the vanity of riches and devoted his subsequent <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to the things of the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>. Joy experienced a similar midlife revelation which informed his new vision of the world. His <i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a></i> article led to a $1.5 million book deal with Viking and purchase of a luxury $15 million apartment high in the new Perry Towers in Manhattan from which to contemplate more comfortably the emptiness of his riches. Ready or not, looming large in Joy's <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> one can imagine solemn meetings with Hillary, no doubt during which will be explored the most altruistic methods for preventing others from following his path.</p>
<p>Yet surely Joy's example as one of the supreme inventors and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is far more relevant and compelling than his current siege of ideas. By launching Sun as the enabling <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> enterprise, Joy created a company that has expanded the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of millions-that has saved millions or even billions of people from their immemorial <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> as members of a barbarian mob, plunged in ignorance, and empowered them as participants in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> adventure on the frontiers of creation. Joy may regard them as a potential threat. But surely, in accord with Joy's Law, they are the solution. It is Joy's policy that is the threat.</p>
<p>If Joy's policy prevails, his fears will reliably come true. The atmosphere will be polluted, the environment despoiled, and good men will cower unarmed and helpless under their desks like the children of Columbine before the menace of a few madmen. When guns-or biotech and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-are outlawed, they will be <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible only to outlaws and a few feckless agents of a police state. Joy and his new allies should learn that in a capitalist democracy the mob-and <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>-are on your side.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I, too, disagreed with Bill Joy's manifesto. I enjoyed Mr. Gilder's counterargument, not least, because I hope to be using some of the nanotech postulated. But, there are some inaccuracies that must be addressed. I don't think they cause much damage to the overall thesis. But I do hope that my points persuade other readers to examine the rest of the article I'm not qualified to critique. I give here an excerpt:

  Werner Von Braun wanted to launch a Redstone rocket into space in 1955! But President Eisenhower said no. The "Missile Gap" was pure fiction sponsored by the CIA. And, the USSR sub fleet NEVER had parity with US designs concerning reliability, quiet operation, duty cycle, or safety. Their only advantage was diving ability enabled by the immense consumption of titanium.

Anyone is invited to correct my "corrections".

<br>
<br>
As I was reading, I thought to myself, "this seems remarkably like the thinking of Gilder or - perhaps in a weak intellecual momemt - Bill Buckley."
<br>
<br>
Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it was indeed co-authored by Gilder (I was prompted to check when I saw the reference to Wealth and Poverty).
<br>
<br>
I am sure that the answer lies somewhere between Mr. Joy's and Mssrs. Gilder/Vigilante's.  Quite frankly the whole discussion emphasizes my belief since the early 1970's that in order to survive the future, we must be sure that all humans have equal and unencumbered access to all information that exists in what we currently term "electronic" form.  Only in that way will we be able to evolve with a reasonable chance of success (let alone with "human rights" and liberty intact).

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>That's exactly the article's point.  It is the Joy's of the world that see the progress of science and knowledge as somehow inimical to Nature (just a replacement for the concept of God) and human development.  I consider myself a religious person, and am probably a member of the so called "religious right" you refer to.  There is absolutely no conflict between the increasing knowledge of the universe brought on by science and religion in my view.    
<br>
<br>
Frankly, referring to someone as being from the "religious right" is getting just a little old.  I don't think the author is at all the religious extremist such a label obviously implies.  Furthermore, there is nothing negative about being religious, or having a faith in a higher power, spirituality, morality, or whatever you want to call it.  It is precisely spiritual development that will enable us to avoid the pitfalls a person like Joy predicts.  Those that lack any moral compass of any kind are far more frightening, to me at least.  Having differing political opinions does not make one a religious fanatic.  It is precisely the attitude of stereotyping others that may look, act, or have different opinions that has caused so much strife in our world to date.
<br>
<br>
If you disagree with the authors' argument(s), then state your points.  Calling someone a member of the "religious right" is an ad hominem attack.  It serves to illustrate nothing but one's own prejudices.</p></td>
