<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>In the beginning, our collective vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> was shaped 
              by the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>: large <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, with lots of blinking lights, that 
              were used by specialists doing rather ominous things for the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> 
              or industry. <i>Popular Mechanics</i> in 1949 made the bold guess 
              that "Where a <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> is equipped with 18,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> 
              tubes and weighs 30 tons, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> may have only 
              1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s and perhaps weigh 1.5 tons." Later came the fictional 
              images inspired by this <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, captured by the Jetsons' cartoon 
              world that put the trappings of big <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s everywhere, cheerfully 
              filling their lives with the same kinds of buttons and blinking 
              lights.</p>
<p>If we look around us now, the single most common reaction to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              was entirely missed by any of the historical visions: irritation. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s taking over the world is not a pressing concern for most 
              people. They're more worried about figuring out where the file they 
              were editing has gone to, why their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> won't turn on, when 
              a Web page will load, whether the battery will run out before they 
              finish working, what <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> to call to find a live person to talk 
              to for tech support.</p>
<p>The irritation can be more than petty. A 1997 wire story reported:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>ISSAQUAH, Wash. (AP)&#8212;A 43-year-old man was coaxed out 
              of his home by police after he pulled a gun on his <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> 
              and shot it several times, apparently in frustration.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Apparently? He shot it four times through the <a class="thought" href="entries/hard_disk_entry.html">hard disk</a>, once through 
              the monitor. He was taken away for mental evaluation; they should 
              have instead checked the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for irrational and antisocial 
              behavior.</p>
<p>There aren't many people left who want to live in The Jetsons's 
              world. I realized this during the early days of the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a>, 
              when I unsuccessfully <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ed the Net to find a picture of the 
              Jetsons. People had made home pages for their cats, and dogs, and 
              cars, but no one was moved to create one for this most technological 
              of cartoons. Given all of the inconveniences of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> 
              Age, who would want to confront <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in still more places?</p>
<p>Over the last few years an alternative vision of the home or office 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> has been emerging, a rather retro one. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              community, the Jetsons' use of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> would be called 
              "<a class="thought" href="entries/ubiquitous_computing_entry.html">ubiquitous computing</a>," making computing available anywhere and 
              everywhere. I'm much more interested in unobtrusive computing, providing 
              solutions to problems everywhere without having to attend to the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. By bringing smarter <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> closer to people it can 
              finally disappear.</p>
<p>Instead of making room for mice, your furniture and floors can 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a>ally detect your gestures. Icons leave the screen 
              and through embedded smart materials they <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> with the tangible 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s that we live with. A few bulky display screens get replaced 
              with changeable <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> inks wherever we now paint or print. 
              The local controllers for these things self-organize themselves 
              into adaptive <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s that don't break if any one <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> does. 
              These <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> may go to and from an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> furnace down in the 
              basement, heating the bits for the whole house. This is a major 
              appliance that handles the high-speed <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> with the outside 
              world, performs the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally intensive tasks like rendering 
              3D graphics, and manages the enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of the accumulated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of the household. Like any furnace it might need periodic 
              maintenance, but when it's working properly it's not even noticed, 
              delivering timely <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> through the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> grates of 
              the household.</p>
<p>A coffeemaker that has <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to my bed, and my calendar, and my 
              coffee cup, and my last few years of coffee consumption, can do 
              a pretty good job of recognizing when I'm likely to come downstairs 
              looking for a cup of coffee, without forcing me to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> one more 
              appliance. Although none of those steps represents a revolutionary 
              insight into artifical <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the result is the kind of sensible 
              behavior that has been lacking in <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> believes that the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              failed to live up to its promise, not because of any lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s or the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers, but because of the limited <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that can't see, or hear, or move. A child 
              has a <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about how the world works that provides 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> so noticeably absent in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Similarly, Seymour 
              Papert feels that the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s for <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> has gotten 
              stuck. We learn by manipulating, not observing. It's only when the 
              things around us can help teach us that <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> can be woven into 
              everyday <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. He's not looking to duplicate the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of a 
              good teacher; he just wants a tennis ball that knows how it has 
              been hit so that it can give you feedback. Marvin and Seymour are 
              looking for answers to some of the most challenging questions about 
              improving <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and the deepest questions about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, 
              in the simplest of places. They believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is going to 
              come from creating large <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of interacting simple <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s.</p>
<p>Just as people like Marvin and Seymour began to realize that, and 
              people like Joe Jacobson and I began to discover that we could make 
              furniture that could see or printing that could change, some unusual 
              companies started showing up in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab. Steelcase was wondering 
              whether your tabletop should be as smart as your laptop. Nike was 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the implications of the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> for footwear. 
              This convergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> interests, technological capabilities, 
              and industrial applications led to the creation in 1995 of a new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> consortium, called Things That Think (TTT).</p>
<p>The first decade of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab's <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> was devoted to the recognition 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> transcends its physical representation. A story is 
              much more than just ink on paper, or silver halide in celluloid 
              film; once it is represented <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly then it's no longer necessary 
              to create an artificial technical boundary between words and images, 
              sights and sounds. The most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant contribution from this era 
              was iconoclasm. It was widely accepted then that it was the job 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s and industry alliances to fight over incompatible 
              standards for new generations of television; now it's broadly accepted 
              that the introduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> into the transmitter and receiver 
              means that <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> television can be scalable, so that the encoding 
              can change if the goal is to send a little image to a portable screen 
              or a giant image to a theater screen, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> can bring a 
              broader <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> with it, such as annotated commentary or connections 
              to current <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>In its second decade, more and more of the work of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab 
              revolves around the recognition that capable bits need capable atoms. 
              The 150 or so industrial sponsors are loosely organized into three 
              broad consortia. Walter Bender's News in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> has <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> 
              providers, asking how to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>, filter, personalize, and distribute 
              timely <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Andy Lippman's <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is looking at what 
              it means to live in a world of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, with questions of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a>. And TTT looks directly at how the 
              physical world meets the logical world. These three groups can roughly 
              be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as the bits, the people, and the atoms. They all need 
              one another, but each provides a community to help focus on those 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s. They overlap in focused groups at the center for areas 
              like toys or cars.</p>
<p>TTT comprises forty companies broadly exploring <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> everywhere 
              but in traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. The bottom layer that I direct is 
              developing the materials and mechanisms to let <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> and 
              compute and communicate. The partners include <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> companies 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/hp_entry.html">HP</a> and Motorola considering new markets for their chips, and 
              things makers like Nike and Steelcase. The middle level, run by 
              Mike Hawley, looks at how to build <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s out of these <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. 
              If my shoe, and yours, is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, how do they find each other 
              anywhere on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>? Companies like <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>, AT&amp;T, and 
              Deutsche Telekom are interested in this kind of connectivity. At 
              the top, guided by Tod Machover, are all of the capabilities enabled 
              by a <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> full of communicating footwear.</p>
<p>The application companies are asking mission-critical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> questions that are wholly unmet right now, literally 
              keeping the CEOs up at night worrying about how to address them. 
              Moving computing from <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s to the desktop was a trivial step; 
              they need it out in the world where their business happens. Disney, 
              for example, is interested in personalization. A theme park attraction 
              can't respond appropriately if it knows only your average height 
              and weight, not your <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and gender. How can a one-cent ticket 
              contain that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and be read from a distance? Federal Express 
              has something of a <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> model, sending all the packages to 
              a central <a class="thought" href="entries/hub_entry.html">hub</a> for processing. Just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> introduced <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing, routing chunks of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> wherever they need to go, FedEx 
              would like a package-<a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. How can a one-cent envelope 
              route itself? Steelcase's customers want the file cabinets to find 
              the file folders: how can a one-cent file folder communicate its 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s? Becton Dickinson made a billion medical syringes last 
              year that are sterile, sharp, and cost a penny. Diabetics are notoriously 
              bad at monitoring their insulin intake; how can a smart syringe 
              be made for a penny? Adding much more than that destroys the whole 
              business model.</p>
<p>Health care is an interesting example. Right now it's really sick 
              care, a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that gets invoked to fix problems rather than anticipate 
              them. One of the biggest medical issues is compliance, getting people 
              to do what's needed to keep them well. Billions of dollars are spent 
              annually just taking care of people who didn't take their <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, 
              or took too much, or took the wrong kind. In a TTT world, the <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> 
              cabinet could monitor the <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> consumption, the toilet could 
              perform routine chemical analyses, both could be connected to the 
              doctor to report aberrations, and to the pharmacy to <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> refills, 
              delivered by FedEx (along with the milk ordered by the refrigerator 
              and the washing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s request for more soap). By making this 
              kind of monitoring routine, better health care could be delivered 
              as it is needed at a lower cost, and fewer people would need to 
              be supervised in nursing homes, once again making headway on a hard 
              problem by building interconnected <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of simple <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s.</p>
<p>It's not possible to go to a technological consultancy and <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              up these kinds of solutions; they need new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s connected 
              into new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. The idea of things <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is old. 
              What's new is the necessity and possibility of solving these problems. 
              That's the work of TTT.</p>
<p>TTT functions more as a "do tank" than a think tank. There are 
              enormous social and industrial implications of the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, but 
              these emerge more from understanding what's been accomplished than 
              by trying to figure them out in advance. While the latter <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              is also valuable, we find that the former is better able to answer 
              questions that we haven't even asked yet, and to fill needs that 
              were not articulated because it was not possible to even conceive 
              of a solution.</p>
<p>And the sponsors need partners to build a business in these emerging 
              areas, but usually a great deal of negotiation is involved before 
              they can work together. Just as we learn a lot from student projects 
              that don't succeed, TTT provides a <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for sponsor companies 
              to try out new business models before the lawyers get involved.</p>
<p>The most immediate consequence of TTT for me has been how it has 
              reshaped the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab. When I came, most people typed at <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              and there were a few desultory <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools sitting neglected in 
              a corner. The <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab now has some of the best fabrication facilities 
              of all kinds on the MIT campus. Even more striking, every group 
              in the building now has an oscilloscope. This is the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> 
              used for developing and <a class="thought" href="entries/debugging_entry.html">debugging</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s; its presence shows 
              that people are designing and modifying their own <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> literacy is quickly coming to include machining, and <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> 
              design, and microcontroller <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming.</p>
<p>Very few people are left just sitting in front of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Or 
              are even left in the building; pursuing these ideas has entailed 
              following them to other spaces. Not to home-of-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> projects, 
              which have generally been rather deadly affairs designed and inhabited 
              by middle-aged white males in suburban settings, but to environments 
              that reflect people's personal passions, whether a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed Volvo 
              driving through Cambridge, or a smart <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> in the Smithsonian museum, 
              or a probe on the summit of Mount Everest.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise is how quickly the work is <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ing. When 
              TTT started it was an elusive <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>, a quirky <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> out of most 
              everyone's field of view. In just a few years it has zoomed into 
              the mainstream, rapidly becoming almost as familiar as an earlier 
              strange notion, multimedia. This pace in turn raises a few questions. 
              The first is when TTT will "happen."</p>
<p>I don't expect there to be an epochal day when heavenly trumpets 
              blare and TTT gets turned on. It's leaking out now, and like so 
              many other technological revolutions, its real arrival will come 
              when the question is no longer interesting. Many early products 
              have been announced or are in the pipeline, and we've seen that 
              people are very quick to incorporate these kinds of capabilities 
              in how they live.</p>
<p>At one of the first TTT meetings, Mitch Resnick's group made smart 
              name badges. These could be dipped into buckets containing answers 
              to provocative questions, such as where you see <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> headed, 
              or what you would read on a desert island. Then, when you met somebody, 
              your badges would compare notes and <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> up a colored bar graph. 
              A long green line meant that you agreed on everything, something 
              that's nice to know. A short red or green line indicated a weak 
              overlap. Most interesting was a long red line, showing that you 
              disagreed on everything. These ended up being the most interesting 
              ones to find, because you were guaranteed to have a lively discussion 
              about anything. This kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> was so useful that during 
              the course of the meeting people incorporated it into the familiar 
              gesture of shaking hands, squaring up and exposing their chests 
              to make sure that the displays were easily seen. All of this happened 
              without any discussion or explanation.</p>
<p>Another project, Tod Machover's <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> Opera, explored the implications 
              of smart spaces for creating an opera that people enter into instead 
              of watching from a distance. The audience shaped the composition 
              through a room full of sensing, computing, communicating <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. 
              At the premiere at Lincoln Center, Joe Paradiso, the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              director, came upon someone in great frustration pounding on a structural 
              girder. Everything else in the environment had responded in interesting 
              ways; this person had a hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> accepting that the girder just 
              held up the building. As more and more things gain the ability to 
              interact, a steel beam that is all body and no <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will indeed 
              come to be seen as deficient.</p>
<p>The next question is what TTT will mean for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. 
              Right now the Net is groaning under the explosion of new hosts and 
              new users. Available <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> decreases as it gets shared among 
              more and more people, and the routing of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> becomes less and less 
              reliable as it becomes harder to keep track of what is where. What 
              will happen to these problems when the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people using the 
              Net is dwarfed by the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of things?</p>
<p>Not too much. A great deal of effort is going into upgrading the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> to handle real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> audio and video, for the killer <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> 
              application: <a class="thought" href="entries/telephony_entry.html">telephony</a>, or videoconferencing, or movies on demand 
              (pick your favorite). But your toaster doesn't need to watch movies. 
              Most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s being connected to the Net are <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> dribblers, 
              things that send a small amount of useful <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> rather than a continuous 
              multimedia stream. These things easily fit into the margins around 
              the heavy users of <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>.</p>
<p>If TTT can happen, then what about <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>? The most Orwellian 
              fears for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> were not paranoid enough to worry about the 
              very real possibility that even your eaves may be doing Big Brother's 
              eavesdropping, or to wonder whose side your shoes will be on.</p>
<p>I believe that in the same way that bringing more <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> closer 
              to people is the way to make it disappear, it is also the path to 
              protecting <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">Cryptography</a> is an arms race that the encoders 
              can always win over the decoders. The effort to encrypt a message 
              more securely grows far more slowly than the effort to crack the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. Because of this, the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> has tried to mandate <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> 
              schemes such as the Clipper <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> that have official back doors that 
              permit "authorized" agencies to decrypt them. These have failed, 
              because <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> is too easy to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> for it to be 
              prevented. A favorite T-shirt at MIT contains a few lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ing a widely known secure cryptosystem; the shirt 
              is officially classified as a munition that cannot be <a class="thought" href="entries/export_entry.html">export</a>ed from 
              the country. Leaving the United States with this shirt, or even 
              a laptop with encrypted passwords, violates the unenforceable law. 
              The real limit to personal use of <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a> has not been regulatory, 
              it's been inconvenience. Your personal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> cannot be routinely 
              protected unless the things around you know how to do that.</p>
<p>Even forgetting <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a>, the official eavesdropping agencies 
              are drowning in the torrent of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> flowing through <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. A 
              wiretap was originally just that, a wire attached on or near another 
              one to pick up the signal. Setting one up merely required <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> 
              to some part of the wire. That no longer works on a high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. It's hopeless to try to pick one phone call out 
              of a billion bits per second passing through an optical fiber. This 
              means that legal eavesdroppers are reduced to pleading for convenient 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. Their demand took the form of the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a>s 
              Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), passed in 1994, mandating 
              manufacturers of telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing equipment to install ports 
              for legal <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> surveillance of calls passing through the <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es.</p>
<p>Like <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a>, this is a battle that the eavesdroppers can't 
              win. It's far easier to generate <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> than it is to analyze it. 
              As the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> increases, as the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of nodes connected 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> increases, and as efficient use of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> replaces 
              easily intercepted messages with signals that appear to be random, 
              the technological challenges presented to the eavesdroppers are 
              going to surpass even what can be solved by legislation. The answer 
              to Big Brother may well be little brother, a world full of communicating 
              things providing a Lilliputian counter to the central control of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>In the end I think that the strength of these technical arguments 
              is going to turn <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> from a regulatory issue to a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of 
              personal choice. Right now the price of your insurance is based 
              on your crude demographics, rather than your personal details. If 
              you drive safely, and you let your car insurance company have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from your car that confirmed that, then you could pay less 
              than the bozo who cuts you off. If you eat well, and you're willing 
              to let your <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance company talk to your kitchen, then you 
              could be rewarded for having a salad instead of a cigarette. The 
              insurance company would not be in the business of enforcing any 
              morality; they would be pricing the expected real cost of behavior. 
              These kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> can be encrypted without revealing 
              irrelevant but sensitive identifying <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, such as where 
              you're driving or when you're home. And the ability to turn insurance 
              from a static document into an on-line tool does not mean that you 
              have to participate; complete <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">privacy</a> will remain available, but 
              it will cost more because the insurance company has less to go on 
              to price your policy.</p>
<p>It's as irritating to lug along at 55 mph in the middle of the 
              Arizona desert as it is to be passed at 155 mph on a winding rain-slicked 
              German autobahn. Setting speed limits is a political process that 
              necessarily results in an unhappy compromise between competing interests 
              and varying needs. Driving faster carries a cost in pollution, road 
              wear and tear, and safety. All of these things have qualifiers, 
              such as the straightness of the road, the condition of your car, 
              and your driving <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. If you're willing to share this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              with the road then speed limits can be dynamically chosen and contain 
              useful <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, rather than the current practice of setting 
              universally ignored rates based on the lowest common denominator. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/privacy_entry.html">Privacy</a> alone is not an absolute good; what <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s is making a 
              sensible tradeoff between private and shared interests. Connecting 
              things provides a way for these tradeoffs to become <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s of personal 
              rather than national policy.</p>
<p>A final question about TTT is what it implies for the stratification 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, locally and globally. If the haves are already diverging 
              from the have-nots, what's going to happen when there are all these 
              new things to have?</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about this essential question, it's <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to recognize 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> rarely causes or fixes social problems; those are 
              a consequence of much larger social forces. In 1747 James Lind, 
              a British ship surgeon, figured out that British sailors were dying 
              at sea from scurvy because they didn't have fresh fruit (containing 
              vitamin <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>). Packing limes let the ships stay at sea much longer, 
              projecting the might of the British Navy much farther. Was that 
              advance in nutrition good or bad? Sailors' lives were saved, other 
              lives were lost from the wars they then fought, lives were saved 
              from the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> imposed by the ensuing empire, more lives were lost 
              getting rid of the empire. It's too simple to credit or blame that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> on vitamin <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.</p>
<p>Granting that, there are modest grounds to think that TTT can help 
              rather than exacerbate the existing divisions. There's a new foundation 
              growing out of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, called 2B1, to develop and deploy 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> for children in developing countries. It's 
              almost, but not quite, a <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab Peace Corps. Instead of drilling 
              wells for water, 2B1 will provide <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> wells for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>I was struck by many things when a large group of representatives 
              of developing countries came to visit the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab for the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. I expected there to be a great deal of sensitivity about cultural 
              imperialism, or cultural pollution, in presuming to connect African 
              villages to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. Instead, in many different ways, people 
              expressed the belief that the world is changing quickly, and it 
              is far more elitist to insist that developing countries <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              through all of the stages of the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a> before they're 
              allowed to browse the Web. They want to participate on an equal 
              footing with the rest of the world. The loss of local culture is 
              a valid concern, but then the Web has also served to foster the 
              creation of community among nearby people who had not had a means 
              to communicate among themselves before its arrival.</p>
<p>The technological challenges they've presented line up almost perfectly 
              with the work of TTT. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in the middle of the veldt must 
              need no spare parts, has to run without an electrical outlet or 
              telephone line, can't require calls to technical support, must be 
              usable without a manual, and be insanely cheap and indestructible. 
              Such a thing is not in the direct lineage of a desktop PC; it requires 
              a range of new technologies.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> in the veldt already provides a model for what this might 
              eventually look like; <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> is the master designer of adaptive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that fix themselves. Extrapolating the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> 
              Lab from bits to atoms leads rather directly to <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> we've got a lot of work to do to create 
              around people inanimate technologies that they can trust. Beyond 
              that, it's impossible not to speculate about implanting them in 
              people. Your body is already the ultimate wearable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>; why 
              not move the heads-up display to your <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>? Striking work is being 
              done in augmenting people's sensory and motor disabilities in this 
              manner, but I don't trust anyone yet to be able to do these things 
              on a purely discretionary basis. It's not until the technologies 
              outside of people become so useful and reliable that I couldn't 
              live without them that I would consider trying to live with them. 
              I'm not ready to see a dialog box reading, "You just crashed, OK?" 
              and then have to take a nap to reboot.</p>
<p>If the present work of TTT succeeds, implants are the natural next 
              step, equally intriguing and frightening. Even more so is what could 
              come after that, editing the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> so that you grow the right parts. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> already guides the fabrication of such exquisite <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              as the eye and the hand (as well as more problematical hacks like 
              the knee). What's so privileged about our current eye design? We 
              now do know a lot about optics, and <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, and could design 
              eyes that have a broader spectral response, say, or that could look 
              backward as well as forward. There are no longer serious ontological 
              debates about the design of the eye as proof of the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, but we haven't taken seriously the converse that if the design 
              of the eye does not represent divine intervention, and we don't 
              intend to replace one deity with another by defying <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, then 
              the eye is open to mortal improvement. And who says we just have 
              to upgrade our existing senses. Growing up I was disappointed when 
              I realized that it appeared that I didn't have ESP, but I do know 
              how to use a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone to talk around the world. How about adding 
              radios to brains?</p>
<p>The attendant ethical, social, and scientific challenges are staggering, 
              but the point stands that our current construction represents one 
              evolved and evolving solution and that it is open to improvement. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> is a consequence of interaction, and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> 
              is profoundly changing how we interact; therefore, it's not crazy 
              to think about an impact on <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. If I'm far from being ready 
              to let someone implant a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, I'm certainly nowhere near being 
              willing even to entertain seriously a discussion of aftermarket 
              additions to the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, but I have to admit that that is the logical 
              destination of current trends. I fear, and hope, that we eventually 
              reach that point. You'll be able to tell we're getting close when 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab starts hiring molecular biologists.</p>
<p>In between the dimly glimpsed, terrifying, and thrilling possibility 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, and the present <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of an overhyped 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> revolution, lies a foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> that is increasingly 
              clear and appealing. In retrospect it looks like the rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> may have been just the trigger charge that 
              is now setting off the real explosion, as things start to use the 
              Net so that people don't need to. As <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> grows 
              out of its awkward adolescence, bringing more capabilities closer 
              to people is proving to be the path to make it less obtrusive and 
              more useful. The implications of this change are on display in the 
              laboratory now, and given the combination of industrial push and 
              consumer pull it's hard to believe that they will not soon be equally 
              familiar elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now that <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> has become multi, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> has become virtual, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> is cyber, perhaps we can return to appreciating the rest 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. As a technologist so frequently annoyed by <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              as an academic developing products, as a member of the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> wondering 
              about the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, I can't imagine a more exciting 
              mission than merging the best of the world that we are born into 
              with that of the worlds we're creating.</p>
