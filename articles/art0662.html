<div class="TeaserText">The human brain faces a challenging future. To cope with accelerating nanotech- and biotech-based developments in an increasingly complex world, compete with emerging superintelligence, and maintain its performance and sustainability as people live longer, the fragile human brain will need major enhancements: a backup system, eliminating degenerative processes, direct mind-linkup to ubiquitous computing networks, error-correction for memory, and a global Net connection with remote neural access. </div>

<p><b>Concern: Convincing <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> needs to keep up 
              with the changes ahead.</b> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each one of us has been entrusted with the care and nourishment 
              of what might be the most extraordinary and complex creation in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Home to <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> and personality, the <i><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brain</i> 
              archives cherished memories and hopes for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. It arranges 
              and coordinates the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> that gives us purpose, 
              passion, <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the brain is too fragile. It is far too vulnerable to be allowed 
              to continue in its current state. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to properly sustain the 
              brain, we need to know what it likes, the challenges it craves, 
              the rest it requires, and the protection it deserves. In short, 
              the brain must have a strategy for its future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But is it really necessary to take <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> now? I submit that if 
              events have altered the day-to-day <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s of the brain, affecting 
              how it performs its operations and whether it can sustain for the 
              long haul, then now is the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to take action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, there has been a series of technological events causing 
              irrevocable changes in the external environment of the brain. People 
              are living longer; there is a notable increase in the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 
              activists supporting <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> technologies; economic reporting 
              predicts an increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development of molecular manufacturing 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>; <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers are reveling in the increase 
              in research and development of <a class="thought" href="entries/superintelligence_entry.html">superintelligence</a>; and conservative 
              organizations are publishing warnings indicating an increased awareness 
              of the potential threats of superintelligence. These events will 
              directly or indirectly affect the brain, resulting in a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of expectations 
              for the brain to function over a longer period of time and operate 
              at a higher level of quality than it has ever achieved in the past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To keep pace and sustain itself for the long haul, the brain needs 
              a strategy that takes into account the present circumstances and 
              what the future may hold. Currently, the brain is challenged by 
              a demand to produce better cognitive capabilities more quickly and 
              efficiently for a longer period of time. Simultaneously there is 
              an increased rate of neurological degeneration of brain cells resulting 
              from increased longevity. And even though it is not a current threat, 
              soon there will be a need to keep up with the acceleration of competitive 
              superintelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Developing a strategy for the brain requires a balance of several 
              elements: a compelling vision for its future, strategic goals, an 
              action plan, and a means for measuring the success of the plan. 
              But before we can develop a strategic plan for the brain, we have 
              to know more about the brain's ability to meet the needs of 
              the contemporary <i>mind</i>. This may seem like an abstract project 
              because it would require us to separate the brain as a functioning 
              organization of cells, or agents, from the mind. Nevertheless, an 
              effective way to do this is to fictionalize the brain&#8212;make 
              it a character or a business <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the brain had an executive statement, for example, it might 
              read something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Statement of the Brain</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mission of the brain is to serve its cells by adopting the 
                advantages of emerging technologies to ensure a smart, safe and 
                sustainable environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brain develops best practices for cognitive and creative 
                processes. The brain's central <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> is located 
                in the neocortex, and has connections through the internal and 
                external <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brain's quality services are unique and exclusive, and 
                its target supply chain is <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> cells and <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s with upper-end 
                job-related responsibilities. The brain's competitive "intelligence" 
                edge is that its services are 100% man-made, unlike competitors, 
                such as superintelligence and friendly <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>s. 
                By this fact, the brain's mind hopes to attract <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>s 
                and investors that value the artistry of producing neurological 
                connections and their emergent properties such as critical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>, day-dreaming, problem-solving, <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a> and intellection. 
                Since the brain's responsibilities are mostly to serve the 
                day-to-day functions of the mind, as well as to elaborate networking 
                and communications assistance for the mind and body, it is considered 
                to be in the communications market, although some mental personas 
                use the end-result products, such as ideas, for themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the year 2006, the brain plans to develop strategic initiatives 
                to protect its future and gain a competitive edge in the "intelligence" 
                marketplace. Over the past few decades, the brain's longevity 
                has increased along with its competitors, necessitating a reevaluation 
                of its position and its future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brain's future is uncertain due to advancing cogitative 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s such as AI and superintelligence. Adding to the external 
                environment of the brain is the fact that new <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> enterprises 
                entering the marketplace are drawing business away from the brain. 
                Encephalitis and other invasive viral infections, as well as dementia 
                and neurological breakdowns, are eating away at the resources 
                of the brain's affiliates. This pending shortage has created 
                an immense demand for increased <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regardless of some of the internal flaws of the brain, there 
                is great potential for its continued success. The brain will improve 
                faltering memory by adding a backup system; will expand to direct 
                mind-linkup <a class="thought" href="entries/ubiquitous_computing_entry.html">ubiquitous computing</a> networks; will add error-correction 
                memory replay and a global Net connection with remote neural <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, 
                guarded by security protocol. The brain plans to support its entire 
                system by eliminating degenerative processes that impede the ability 
                for a healthy, vital <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in its goal to keep up with the many 
                changes ahead.</p>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>While the executive statement is a fictionalized story, it does 
              contain tangible elements. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that our brains need to 
              be protected and improved upon. The brain's future depends upon 
              how we want our brains to perform in the coming years and how much 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> is actually needed, both invasively and noninvasively, 
              to satisfy this end. Since our brains contain our memories, and 
              our memories build our identities, this is a serious <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. But 
              because we cannot see it as clearly as we see our expanding or shrinking 
              bodies, the brain is dismissed while our mind presses for more immediate 
              attention, forgetting the hard fact that unless the brain is in 
              good physical shape, the entire system will falter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today the brain is vulnerable. It is vulnerable because the axial 
              skeleton's skull that encloses and protects the brain is not 
              built from impenetrable material; its command-and-control center, 
              including the white matter in between, is in constant danger of 
              breakdown, infection, and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>; and its cognitive processes are 
              subject to loss of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trends five to ten years in the future suggest an increase in technologies, 
              including biotech and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>, for building better brains to operate 
              with better bodies in meeting the needs of people living longer. 
              Further future trends suggest people opting for the synthetic brain 
              over a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brain. Markets point to an expected increase in 
              neurosurgery, neuroinformatics, neuromarketing, biotechnologies, 
              and human performance enhancements with an explicit focus on nanotechnology. 
              But the consequential inclination is that of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> intelligence 
              challenging human intelligence. Lurking in the foreground of the 
              future is whether or not the brain will be able to keep pace with 
              new technologies that will otherwise outperform it.<br>
<br>
              Based on potential threats and opportunities, and on the brain's 
              mission to serve its cells by adopting the advantages of emerging 
              technologies to ensure a smart, safe and sustainable environment, 
              the brain's strategy narrows down to: (1) enhancing its performance 
              and sustainability in order to satisfy the needs of people living 
              longer; (2) competing with emerging superintelligence; and (3) enhancing 
              its cognitive capabilities in order to deal with the problems of 
              an increasingly complex world.<br>
<br>
              With these issues on the table, the brain needs a practical approach 
              hedged by a strong vision that helps society understand the opportunities 
              and the threats that await all of us. This is not just an abstract 
              discussion; it includes everyone, not a select few. It is not simply 
              a matter of being smarter or more capable; it is a matter of healthy 
              and vital living. It is a matter of being prepared for the challenges 
              of the future, and a measurable goal of convincing others to be 
              prepared as well.<br>
<br>
              Convincing people is not an easy task, especially when minds have 
              already been made up. But I think that we must work toward convincing 
              society that the brain needs to accelerate with the rate of technological 
              change, as our vision and audition have through innovative corrective 
              technologies, and our arms and legs have with robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/prosthetics_entry.html">prosthetics</a>, 
              and as other parts of our bodies have transformed and renewed in 
              working together to keep us alive.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I agree with this article that we should be prepared  for migration of our mind from biological brain to a new nanotechnological platform. The extrapolation of price of computation and the accuracy of scanning of the brain activity suggests that it should be possible within 25 years. The only problem that seems to exist is the problem of our internal consciousness 'Is human mind cloneable?'. If a copy of my mind is going to be prepared and I will wake up, what I will be, at what copy I will wake up? This are probably wrong questions, they do not make sense, they are probably like a question 'What is the color of the time?'. Our consciousness is rather like a flame generated by the burning of a candle, it is a phenomenon generated by a process, by a process connected with the working of the brain. When the information-related processes that go on in the brain will be reproduced then the consciousness related to that processes will be reproduced.
<br>
<br>
When the technology to make the migration available will be available in 25 years without any dedicated projects. The price of computing power will decrease as effect of need to produce more capable information processing devices. The scanning of the brain will be improved for medical and research purposes. Should we start dedicated processes to make it faster, to integrate the brain with electronic devices now (or in 5 or 10 years)?
<br>
<br>
We could backup our brain by being creative, by making notes about the most important issues in our lives, by making notes about what happened in our every day live. By creating such kind of notes we are creating part of our mind outside our brain. When this information is well organized, easily available to access via various electronic platforms, we feel like it is a part of us. When this information is backuped every day in several different places, when it is possible to roll-back the changes that have been done by accident you may feel quite comfortable that your memory will not easily disappear.
<br>
<br>
More than 5 years ago I have created such kind of system of notes, the notes have been describing each almost day. I have been writing my feelings. At the beginning the system contained small portion of my live-related information, bet when it was growing it became more and more useful. Recently I have been adding to the system the dairy I have been writing 15 years ago. Sometimes I have the feeling that system contains more details about the past that my memory, but it is obviously not true, the system contains references to days. The system contains statements, but my mind contains feelings and images, but my mind and the system have created a new quality. For me this is the first step to migrate the mind to new nanotechnological platform.
<br>
<br>
Let's come back to question what is the consciousness? Imagine yourself 10 years ago. During recent 10 years everyone of us have changed so much that we could say that the me from 10 years before disappeared and a new was created. The contents of the consciousness of me from 10 years before the seems to not exists any more, but such consciousness could come back when reading detailed notes written 10 years ago. It could come only for some moments but it could come. If we would create a copy of you during a sleep in what body would you wake up? There would be two entities claiming that they are You. But where would you really be. This is wrong question. Why this is wrong question? This is wrong question because we could not extend consciousness to a future. The flame of a candle may disappear in the future.
<br>
You may ask where is that flame, where I may find it. Or the flame of may be moved to a better candle where it will not disappear so soon.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hello I  read  your  statement  and  you  have got  there  more  questions  than  that  of your commentary  to the statement  above..
<br>
<br>
You mentioned  about  the  barin cloning fraudibility.
<br>
I  wanna  say  you  something  that  anything that  you  can think  and  imagine with  your  mind  now  means that it  is going  to  be  realized  some  time in the  future.  it's not  my  wisdom it's  the  words  spoken by the  great  minds ..I  forgot  but I  know  that he  was  some  kinda astrobiologist.
<br>
Brainis  really  an amazing  thing  that gives  us  us..  makes  us  conscious  and saves distant  memories . memorizes  the  things  we  want  and analyzes slutions  for  the  problems we  come  up  against.  sometimes they  are  washed  by  other  people :)
<br>
Anyway they are  the origin of  our  identities.. 
<br>
The  question that whether the  brain could  get improved  by  human interference is  a  bit early  thing  for  us.. the  minds that we  will  use to  explore  the  minds  that  telling  us  what  to  do  must  be much  more developed  than the  mind it  will  explore..  I  think  than we definitely  should  interfere  with  our  augmentation to help  our  minds  to achieve  this.. actually  first of  all  we  gotta  uncover the  brain structure  and  the whole functions  it  does  and then explore  every neuron out  of 100 billion  and  each  of  which is  directly connected  with 10 000 other  neurons..  and  there  are  lots  of  types  of  neurons that  perform specofoc  tasks just  like  genes..
<br>
It's an amazing  thing ..  it  took 15  years  for  humans ..  with  our  present  tecnology  and  brains  to  explore  just  the types  of  3 billion nucleotides and genes as in HUMAN GENOME PROJECT. But  we didn't  explore fully  about  their  functions and structures  and  we  have  got  another  30 or  40 years  to  be  able  to  learn for  example  how  to  engineer  genes  for  a  specific  tasks..  we  may  achieve  this  but  it  will  be  definitely  diffcult  to copy  the whole  genes  and  proteins  of  the  nature  and  try to  recreate us  and other  living  things..  You  know  wat, the  problem is  that 22 amino  acids  can make trillionth of  proteins that  can perform trillionth  of other  specific  tasks  for  the  organism..
<br>
and  about  the  Neurology  and  about  100 billion neurons  and different types  of  neurons  that  occur  in 100 billion and  try  to  define  connections of each neuron ... that  is  directly connected  to  10 000  different other  neurons  is  really  a  tiring  work..  and  one of  the most  interesting  though,,  but  we  can perform these  things  by  our  machinery  by  our  highly  qualified  computational robotics  that  can perform "FLOPS" (FLoating Point Operations Per Second) or TFLOPS (10 to the power of 12 FLOPS); this measurement is based on a particular benchmark which does LU decomposition of a large matrix..
<br>
But still our  technology is novice.We  gotta do more first  of  all  to increase  our  computational  capacity.
<br>
and  we will  be  able to realize  anything  we can think of..</p></td>
