<br>
<br><p>The ten years since <a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a> was first published have brought us far along the path to the development of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and molecular manufacturing. Advances have been faster than I had expected.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> concepts have also been more controversial than I had expected. Even now, after (for example) the US <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Advisor has called for the development of molecular manufacturing, segments of the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> establishment are still having difficulties with some quite simple ideas.</p>
<p>It seems obvious that gaining thorough control of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> at the molecular level will enable major technological advances, and our <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward this ability is likewise obvious. The molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> provides an existence proof for enormous capabilities. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> advances in building such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are reported in journals every week. Perhaps the short <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> horizons common in US and European <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> provide the excuse for neglecting the consequences of what we already know to be possible.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a> projected the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> publishing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s; now it is at last appearing on one. While the Web lacks several important features, it nonetheless provides many of the benefits described in <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s.</p>
<p>It's gratifying to see <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s made available in this new medium. My thanks to Russell Whitaker for putting it into <a class="thought" href="entries/html_entry.html">html</a>, and to Jim Lewis for scanning in the text for an earlier HyperCard version.</p>
<p>[<b>NOTE:</b> A serious omission was made in an earlier version of the credits for the conversion work done on the original text. Additional acknowledgment should be made to <i>John L. Quel</i>, in cooperation with <i>The Boeing Company</i> and <i>John Cramer</i>, of the <i>University of Washington</i>, both of whom contributed an enormous effort several years ago, shortly after the first publication of the book, in scanning and OCRing the original text... back when scanning was a major technical feat. Thanks to <i>Dr. Jim Lewis</i> for bringing this to our attention. - <i>Russell</i>]</p>
<p>There's not much I'd change in <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s if rewritten today (that is, I'd fiddle all the details and make it worse, but change little of the substance). The technological work keeps evolving and expanding in scope and analytical detail, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> concepts have survived critical examination, on the net and elsewhere.</p>
<p>To keep in touch with developments in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, contact <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> or see Foresight's Web site and the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing site now under development.</p>
