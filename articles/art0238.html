<br><p>Originally published July 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011121356/http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lloyd/lloyd_index.html" target="_new">Edge</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 2, 2001.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a> is pervading the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s. I believe it began about 400 years ago, if you look at the first paragraph of Hobbes's famous book <i>Leviathan.</i> He says that just as we consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body to be like a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, like a clock where you have sinews and muscles to move <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> about, a pulse beat like a pendulum, and a heart that pumps <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in, similar to the way a weight supplies <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to a clock's pendulum, then we can consider the state to be <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to the body, since the state has a prince at its head, people who form its individual portions, legislative bodies that form its organs, etc. In that case, Hobbes asked, couldn't we consider the state itself to have an <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>?</p>
<p>To my <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that was the first use of the phrase <i><a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a></i> in the form that we use it today. If we have a physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that's evolving in a physical way, according to a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules, couldn't we consider it to be artificial and yet living? Hobbes wasn't talking about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing explicitly, but the examples he used were, in fact, examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing. He used the example of the clock as something that is designed to process <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, as something that gives you <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Most pieces of the clock that he described are <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s not only for transforming <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, but actually for providing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. For example, the pendulum gives you regular, temporal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. When he next discusses the state and imagines it having an <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, he first talks about the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the seat of the state's <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> processes, and that <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, in my mind, accomplishes two things.</p>
<p>First, Hobbes is implicitly interested in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Second, he is constructing the fundamental metaphor of scientific and technological inquiry. When we think of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> as possessing a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in and of itself, and when we think of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s as doing the same kinds of things that we ourselves do, we are also <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> the corollary, that is, we are doing the same kinds of things that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s do. This metaphor, one of the most powerful of <a class="thought" href="entries/enlightenment_entry.html">the Enlightenment</a>, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> pervaded the popular culture of that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Eventually, one could argue, that metaphor gave rise to Newton's notions of creating a dynamical picture of the world. The metaphor also gave rise to the great inquiries into thermodynamics and heat, which came 150 years later, and, in some ways, became the central mechanical metaphor that has informed all of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> up to the 20th century.</p>
<p>The real question is, when did people first start talking about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in such terms that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing rather than clockwork became the central metaphor for our times? Because until the 20th century, this Enlightenment mode of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> of physical things such as mechanical objects with their own dynamics as being similar to the body or the state was really the central metaphor that informed much scientific and technological inquiry. People didn't start <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about this mechanical metaphor until they began building <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, until they had some very good examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, like clocks for instance. The 17th century was a fantastic century for clockmaking, and in fact, the 17th and 18th centuries were fantastic centuries for building <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, period.</p>
<p>Just as people began conceiving of the world using mechanical metaphors only when they had themselves built <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, people began to conceive of the world in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing, only when they began dealing with <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing. All the mathematical and theoretical materials for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> of the world in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, including all the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> formulas, were available at the end of the 19th century, because all these <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> formulas had been created by Maxwell, Boltzmann and Gibbs for statistical mechanics. The formula for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> was known back in the 1880s, but people didn't know that it dealt with <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Instead, because they were familiar with things like heat and mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that processed heat, they called <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in its mechanical or thermodynamic manifestation, <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. It wasn't until the 1930s, when people like Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener, and before them Harry Nyquist, started to think about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing for the primary purpose of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, or for the purposes of controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s so that the role of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and feedback could be controlled. Then came the notion of constructing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that actually processed <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Babbage tried to construct one back in the early 19th century, which was a spectacular and expensive failure, and one which did not enter into the popular mainstream.</p>
<p>Another failure concerns the outgrowth of the wonderful work regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> in other fields such as control theory, back in the late 1950s, early 1960s, when there was this notion that <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">cybernetics</a> was going to solve all our problems and allow us to figure out how social <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s work, etc. That was a colossal failure -- not because that idea was necessarily wrong, but because the techniques for doing so didn't exist at that point -- and, if we're realistic, may in fact never exist. The applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> that were spectacularly successful are not even called <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> because they're so ingrained in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, in fields like control theory, and in the aerospace techniques that were used to put men on the moon. Those were the great successes of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>, remarkable successes, but in a more narrow technological field.</p>
<p>This brings us to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, which in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> is almost like Anti <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>, the evil twin of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>. The word <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> comes from the Greek word <i>kybernotos</i> which means a governor -- helmsman, actually, the <i>kybernotos</i> was the pilot of a ship. <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>, as initially conceived, was about governing, or controlling, or guiding. The great thing about the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, as far as I'm concerned, is that it's completely out of control. In some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> the fact of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> goes way beyond and completely contradicts the Cybernetic ideal. But, in another <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> -- the way in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">cybernetics</a> are related, <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> was fundamentally on the right track. As far as I'm concerned what's really going on in the world is that there's a physical world where things happen. I'm a physicist by training and I was taught to think of the world in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, momentum, pressure, <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. You've got all this <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, things are happening, things are pushing on other things, things are bouncing around.</p>
<p>But that's only half the story. The other half of the story, its <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> half, is the story about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. In one way you can think about what's going on in the world as <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, stuff moving around, bouncing off each other -- that's the way people have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about the world for over 400 years, since Galileo and Newton. But what was missing from that picture was what that stuff was doing: how, why, what? These are questions about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. What is going on? It's a question about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> being processed. <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a> about the world in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about it in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>.</p>
<p>To my mind, that is where the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> is, not just <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the world as <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on its own, or as <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> on its own, but looking at the confluence of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and how they play off against each other. That's exactly what <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> was about. Wiener, who is the real father of the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>, conceived of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, things like feedback control. How much <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, for example, do you need to make something happen?</p>
<p>The first physicists studying these problems were scientists who happened to be physicists, and the first person who was clearly aware of the connection between <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, and physical mechanics and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> like quanta was Maxwell. Maxwell, in the 1850s and 60s, was the first person to write down formulas that related what we would now call <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> -- ideas of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> -- to things like <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. He was also the first person to make such an explicit connection.</p>
<p>He also had this wonderfully evocative far-out, <a class="thought" href="entries/gibson_entry.html">William Gibson</a>-esque notion of a demon. "Maxwell's Demon" is this hypothetical being that was able to look very closely at the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s of gas whipping around in a room, and then rearrange them. Maxwell even came up with a model in which the demon was sitting at a partition, a tiny door, between two rooms and he could open and shut this door very rapidly. If he saw fast <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s coming from the right and slow <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s coming from the left, then he'd open the door and let the fast <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s go in the lefthand side, and let the slow <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s go into the righthand side.</p>
<p>And since Maxwell already knew about this connection between the average speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, and he also knew that <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> had something to do with the total number of <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s, the total number of states a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can have, he pointed out, that if the demon continues to do this, the stuff on the lefthand side will get hot, and the stuff on the righthand side will get cold, because the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s over on the left are fast, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s on the right are slow.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Seems a good place to repeat the reply I got for my request for a knowledgable person to proofread ES's maths in '
<br>
<br>
'hey Ex- still trying to wade through the trolls at MindX? I see that extrasense is still there [makes sense considering he has been banned from every other forum on the internet]
<br>
<br>
LOL- him and his silly rants against nanotech and quantum computers- I see he is using his made-up 'math' to show how impossible everything is-
<br>
<br>
first he is still clueless as to the nature of the uncertainty principle- which tells us what kind of information we can get about a particle when it is measured- however any high school chemistry student knows that the bonds and interactions between atoms and molecules are based on the very certain shapes and properties of the electron clouds that those uncertain electrons form- all forms of computing including chemical and quantum computing rely on very predictable rules of chemical and force interactions that have nothing to do with measurements of classical particles-
<br>
<br>
also it's ironic that he posts these numbers about heat- when there is already an excellent article by MIT's Seth Lloyd right there at KurzweilAI.net that gives detailed hard science answers to what computational power the laws of physics allows for the "ultimate laptop" and what is practical with the manufacturing techniques we know we already have: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011121356/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame...s/art0238.html" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame...s/art0238.h  tml</a>
<br>
<br>
it should be noted that extresense's warnings about heat are quite curious- as there are a many different forms of material substrates which can be harnessed for both classical and quantum computation that can provide efficient and reliable input/output to temperatures far beyond the core of a star- very hot/very brief physical states have been produced and harnessed by human engineers for many applications for over half a century now- does he really think that molecular computing/ bio/dna computing/ quantum computing elements have the same material limits as IC technology? even so- just considering silicon semiconductors there are already many methods being devised to deal with heat [for example <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011121356/http://www.vxm.com/21R.30.html" target="_blank">http://www.vxm.com/21R.30.html</a> ] his arguments are similar to those used to argue against human flight or the sound barrier-'.
<br>
<br>
If Extrasense wants to know why I trust this person's word over his own, it is because this person (Set/ai) used to post on MindX a lot and has demonstrated high knowledge in the relevant areas. He knows his stuff. And he is not a conspiracy theory nut like certain people I could mention:)</p></td>

"The elementary particles that register and process information in the ultimate laptop are jiggling around at a temperature of a billion degrees.  The ultimate laptop looks like a small piece of the Big Bang.  (Packaging technology will have to make considerable progress before anyone will want to put the ultimate laptop on his lap).  Thus the number of ops per second that our small but powerful computer can perform is a huge number, a million billion billion billion billion billion (10/51) ops per second.
