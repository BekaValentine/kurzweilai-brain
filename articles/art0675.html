<p><i>Originally published in </i><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">Perception</a>s: A Review 
              of Ultraprecision <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering and Nanotechnology, Volume 2, No. 
              2<i>, May 8, 2006. Reprinted May 24, 2006 by KurzweilAI.net.</i></p>
<p>The development of molecular nanotechnology (MNT) promises to lead 
              rapidly to cheap superior replacements for a large majority of durable 
              goods, a substantial fraction of all non-durable goods, <i>all</i> 
              existing utilities, and some services. For this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> and due to 
              the relatively low expected cost of developing nanofactories,<sup>1</sup> 
              MNT represents the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> opportunity of all <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Unfortunately, 
              the very size of the opportunity &#8212;combined with its extreme 
              suddenness, <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> significance, potential for disruption of existing 
              institutions, and ease of duplication&#8212;creates certain severe 
              complications that lead to difficulties in capturing the value created.</p>
<p>MNT also has the potential to impact the timeframes and severities 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of major global risks such as those of <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a>, emergent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>, omnicidal war, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> due 
              to competition by either intelligent or unintelligent robotic competitors, 
              for which reason there are <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant non-commercial motivations 
              for preventing its unrestricted utilization. As a result of these 
              difficulties and of the intrinsic uncertainty associated with any 
              particular attempt to develop MNT, commercial development of MNT 
              is likely to be much less rapid than would be predicted from a simple 
              consideration of the value to be created, relevant time horizon, 
              and risk adjusted discount rate.</p>
<p>Despite this, it remains highly probable that MNT will first be 
              realized by a commercial project for the simple reason that probabilistic 
              priors so strongly favor commercial development of new technologies. 
              A slew of militarily relevant technologies were developed by the 
              US, German, and Russian <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s during the Second World War 
              and in its aftermath, but that was at a time when the commercial 
              and public sectors were far more fully integrated than they are 
              today and when the external pressures forcing governmental efficacy 
              were greater. By contrast, over the last few decades, virtually 
              every significant technological development has been commercial 
              in origin (or even recreational, e.g. the <a class="thought" href="entries/open_source_entry.html">Open Source</a> movement and 
              SpaceShip One) rather than public. Governmental R&amp;D initiatives, 
              such as those aimed at curing <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and AIDS and at developing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> travel and fusion power have tended to fail totally or almost 
              totally during the past 30+ years.</p>
<p>Given that an important subset of possible scenarios are driven 
              by commercial development, it seems prudent to examine in some detail 
              the major features of most commercial scenarios and to identify 
              the ways in which developers may <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> unique difficulties 
              distinct from those associated with the development of other products 
              and the ways in which they may manage those difficulties. This paper 
              will attempt to do that, examining the probable implications of 
              both relatively open and relatively secretive development <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> of successful development of MNT. It will be assumed 
              that the developers are highly rational and informed, and that they 
              are attempting to maximize profit in the relatively short term while 
              avoiding the most serious risks of MNT. Development will be assumed 
              to occur within the next 20 years, over the backdrop of a world 
              politically and technologically fairly similar to our own, and with 
              a historically typical gap of a few years between the initial development 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and its successful imitation or <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation 
              by competing projects. It also will be assumed that the more powerful 
              MNT applications, such as those in <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> amplification, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuroscience_entry.html">neuroscience</a>, 
              extremely powerful distributed robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> 
              (AI) will take some time to emerge even given nanofactories and 
              massive funding.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Competitive Strategy</h2>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The simplest and most traditional of the problems facing MNT developers 
              is competitive pricing. Setting the prices of MNT goods close to 
              the cost of production provides little profit with which to expand 
              or compensate for risk undertaken, while setting prices too high 
              threatens both to unnecessarily reduce consumption below the optimal 
              level and to draw both legal and illegal competitors into the field. 
              In addition, given the number of industries in which MNT products 
              are likely to compete and the political clout of many of those industries, 
              either high or low prices could motivate <a class="thought" href="entries/antitrust_entry.html">antitrust</a> concerns. Theoretically, 
              a higher price is indicative of a monopoly while a lower price indicates 
              competition, but a lower price will also lead to more successful 
              and rapid competition with existing companies and to greater market 
              share, and this could be seen as evidence of monopoly status or 
              of anticompetitive tactics.</p>
<p>Motivating competitors to develop MNT is probably the most serious 
              risk associated with high pricing. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to minimize this risk 
              it will be necessary for prices to be relatively low, and also for 
              expenses to appear as great as possible. It will be particularly 
              desirable (from the commercial developer's point of view) that the 
              <i>apparent</i> cost of developing MNT be as great as possible, 
              as this is the expense that can most easily be inflated. One way 
              in which this can be done is to publicly spend as much money as 
              possible on <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> ostensibly aimed at developing nanofactories 
              over a fairly long period of time <i>after</i> nanofactories actually 
              have been developed. Money can soundly be borrowed in order to fund 
              this research, even at high interest rates, due to the certainty 
              of eventual success. Meanwhile, profits can be generated via the 
              sale of supposedly incremental results of the nanofactory research 
              such as gem quality or better diamonds, doped <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              modestly more powerful than those otherwise available at a given 
              price, and inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>.</p>
<p>Once the nanofactories are publicly acknowledged to exist, the 
              apparent low hanging fruit associated with the supposed development 
              trajectory will be depleted, and a substantial fraction of the global 
              pool of technical experts plausibly capable of relevant work will 
              have already been recruited, discouraging imitation. In addition, 
              the creditors will constitute a class of stakeholders in the new 
              technology who are nonetheless integrated into the existing economic 
              system. Loan repayment will contribute to the justification of profit 
              to the public and to the government. In general, the public appears 
              to accept the legitimacy of high profit margins most readily when 
              the product in question is an extremely expensive luxury, an extremely 
              inexpensive everyday item, or a new product with an explicit need 
              to amortize development costs. It is important to point out that 
              it is excessive profit <i>margins</i>, not excessive profits that 
              usually are considered <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ionable. For this reason, actual profits 
              will be greater if expenses can be increased, because the dollar 
              value of a 200% markup is larger on a product costing $100 to produce 
              than on one costing $10. Wasteful expenditures on supposed inputs 
              also can create stakeholders.</p>
<p>Like <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, restricted versions of MNT products can easily be 
              designed and can be sold for lower prices than unrestricted versions. 
              For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, less expensive copies of a given product can be sold 
              to less <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y countries, or even less wealthy regions within a 
              country. This might be accomplished without competing with the products 
              sold to wealthier regions by installing <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> or inertial locators 
              to monitor product location and disable them from functioning outside 
              of their licensed area. In this manner, profitability can be maximized 
              by selling to all potential customers for prices that constitute 
              a reasonable fraction of their willingness to pay. With built-in 
              biometric sensors, some MNT <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s could even be assigned prices 
              based on the personal characteristics of their purchaser. In addition 
              to maximizing profit, this sort of strategy should greatly reduce 
              any humanitarian concerns regarding the distribution of MNT products. 
              The public generally accepts the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of restricted software 
              without resentment. Nanostructured physical objects can be made 
              more difficult to hack than either software or contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, 
              so the restrictions on use built into MNT products can be more robust 
              than those built into today's <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>s or software.<br>
</p>
<h3>IP Protection</h3>
<p>The most likely outcome of <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>ing nanofactories in any given 
              country would be widespread patent violation both by other countries 
              and by many criminal organizations. This would probably be followed 
              by the slew of problems<sup>2</sup> that long have been predicted 
              to accompany uncontrolled MNT development, such as unstable arms 
              races, malicious <a class="thought" href="entries/grey_goo_entry.html">grey goo</a>, and massively oppressive MNT empowered 
              governments. In addition, pirate nanofactories would be used to 
              build nanofactories of unpatented design, which then would be patented.</p>
<p>All this does not mean that IP law cannot contribute some value 
              to an MNT "first mover." A large number of patents of variable scope 
              can be produced to restrict the products that a competing MNT developer 
              can produce legally. Patents on key <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s can obstruct possible 
              commercial efforts to develop competing nanofactories without revealing 
              too much about the workings of existing nanofactories. In a field 
              as large and as unexplored as nanotechnology, there surely will 
              be room for a number of extremely broad patents that can be used 
              to slow down competitors. In such a fast moving field, even a patent 
              that delays competition by a few months before being overturned 
              could be extremely valuable. Potential patents might include mechanochemistry, 
              carbon mechanochemistry, self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, self-replicating 
              programmable productive systems, diamondoid nanoscale machines, 
              and more, but should be chosen to avoid revealing too much about 
              how a nanofactory can be built.</p>
<p>Governments may attempt to force developers to share MNT production 
              capabilities or may simply steal such capabilities. When high-level 
              officials finally begin to distinguish between <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              fantasy and to recognize the technology's potential, they rightly 
              will see MNT as a national security issue. However, preventing simple 
              theft is relatively easy. Nanofactories can be made large enough 
              that they can't be stolen covertly and/or lost. They can also be 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>ly or otherwise equipped for easy <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>y. It 
              would add little <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> to equip all nanofactories with oxidative 
              self-destruction systems. The best way to resist forceful interrogation 
              is probably to not have any <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s within the company who know 
              everything or almost everything that is needed in order to build 
              a new nanofactory, and to hold out the threat of not doing business 
              with countries that violate the company's rights. Directly threatening 
              a country like the United States in this manner would be unwise. 
              Rather than doing that, an indirect threat could be delivered by 
              setting up production facilities in some high political risk countries 
              with little respect for private property. If this is done, it is 
              likely that one of these countries will attempt to steal MNT production 
              capabilities prior to any developed country doing so. If the company 
              responds by destroying all stolen assets, not sharing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, 
              and refusing to trade with that country, this will deter other nations 
              from repeating their mistake, at least in the short term. The desire 
              not to imitate the behavior of disreputable states will be another 
              incentive for developed countries to respect the rights of the developing 
              company.</p>
<p>Throughout the early commercialization of MNT, the continual borrowing 
              of as much money as possible will be a major imperative. This is 
              true for several reasons. The first of these is that it is important 
              to retain control of the company and associated technology in order 
              to implement a relatively long-term plan rather than one that might 
              maximize shareholder profits in the very short term, for which reason 
              stock should not be sold to raise capital. The second is that over 
              the first decade or so, the scale of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> associated with the 
              developing company will be continually increasing at such a rate 
              as to make even ludicrous debts from a few years back trivial. The 
              third reason is to acquire the previously mentioned sets of justificatory 
              expenses and of influential stake-holding creditors. A fourth reason 
              will become relevant later in development, once the potential of 
              MNT is well established and the broader public and public intellectuals 
              become hostile. Hostility is a nearly certain early result of any 
              massive technological disruption regardless of the quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 
              improvements it makes available (aging reversal technologies may 
              turn out to be an exception to this generalization, since their 
              psychological impact will be unprecedented in scope and is not easily 
              predicted, but thus far even aging reversal seems to fit this generalization). 
              As hostility develops in response to massive technological impact, 
              it may be both possible and desirable to slow governmental activity 
              by reducing governmental <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to funds. This might be accomplished 
              by competing with the government to drive up the price of debt and 
              by releasing products which make an attractive lifestyle achievable 
              on the interest payments from a moderate amount of high yield debt, 
              reducing the size of the work-force and thus increasing the cost 
              of running a large bureaucracy. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s should be undertaken 
              gradually so that they are not interpreted as an attack on borrowers 
              and bureaucracies, as that would lead to escalation. By raising 
              both the interest rate and the wages of skilled labor, potential 
              competitors can be further prevented from developing MNT independently.<br>
</p>
<h3>Dealing with Opposition</h3>
<p>Due to the potential for economic and social disruption, some countries 
              may refuse to allow the import of MNT-derived products. This is 
              not a serious problem for an MNT producer. A general boycott by 
              all major nations is extremely unlikely, especially considering 
              the magnitude of the benefits that MNT will make available. Tariffs 
              would take some time to put into effect and whatever nation stood 
              to improve its trade balance via MNT <a class="thought" href="entries/export_entry.html">export</a>s would petition the 
              WTO for tariff elimination. In addition, MNT can be used to produce 
              traditional capital for the production of non-MNT products.4</p>
<p>One of the earliest products released by an MNT developer is likely 
              to be inexpensive hydrocarbons for fuel and other applications. 
              These can be made by harvesting solar <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> over the oceans, using 
              it to hydrolyze water, and using the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> to reduce atmospheric 
              or other (limestone?) CO2. The machinery for all of this can be 
              produced quickly in any quantity with MNT. Floating solar <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>s 
              can be made with either hydrocarbon production or MNT manufacturing 
              capabilities. The manufacturing centers should be designed to utilize 
              the hydrocarbons as feedstock and solar energy as a power source 
              in order to rapidly produce more platforms of both types. Design 
              and control for such platforms should be non-problematic, and their 
              products could be sold on the global petrochemicals and natural 
              gas market. In this case, there would be no practical difference 
              between a country that chooses to purchase oil from traditional 
              sources and one that purchases MNT-derived oil, as both would apply 
              demand to the same pool of global production and impacting the same 
              global price, making boycotts ineffective unless they were extremely 
              broad. Hydrocarbon storage facilities probably will have to conform 
              to all normal laws regarding the storage and transport of hydrocarbons, 
              complicating implementation somewhat. However, simply violating 
              regulations and hiring legal teams to delay the imposition of fines 
              until they are no longer relevant may be an acceptable strategy 
              for faster implementation if the regulatory framework would otherwise 
              slow development overly much.</p>
<p>While MNT will accelerate the development of new products, it will 
              reduce the time required to build new capital even more. As a result, 
              production capabilities sufficient to satisfy global petrochemical 
              demand should take much less time to develop than designs capable 
              of competing in a wide variety of industries. The revenue generated 
              via the initial products will be an important part of what enables 
              the rapid development of newer products.</p>
<p>The revenue from this early activity will be more than sufficient 
              to hire as many researchers and administrators as can be productively 
              utilized to develop new MNT designs. Integrating so many new employees 
              without critical security risks will be a difficult problem, but 
              it should be a manageable one as there are already many companies 
              that face similar difficulties. At this point, the MNT developers 
              also should have enough money to purchase both public opinion and 
              political influence in so far as these goods can be rapidly purchased.</p>
<p>In order to minimize opposition it will be critically important 
              for the developers not to be seen as a non-competitive monolith. 
              This will be particularly difficult if MNT development is overt 
              as opposed to remaining a secret, but it is probably possible under 
              either secret or public development. The company may be best able 
              to avoid conveying the impression of monopoly if it carefully and 
              legally shares its technology with a few select partners who thoroughly 
              appreciate the dangers associated with MNT (especially the critical 
              dangers of uncontrolled AI and unstable arms races), the need to 
              avoid them, and the consequent need to avoid further disseminating 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> technology. If these partners compete in the production 
              and sale of relatively safe MNT products, it is possible that the 
              market generally will be seen as saturated and further entrants 
              will be discouraged. This decision would constitute a non-secretive 
              alternative to the earlier prospect of inflating the apparent cost 
              and difficulty of MNT development, although both strategies could 
              be pursued sequentially. In the case of such a strategy, as in contemporary 
              oligopoly arrangements, branding will become an extremely important 
              part of profit maximization. A more trusted brand probably would 
              be able to charge a substantial premium, especially for nanomedical 
              products and services once those are developed.<br>
              d) First Mover Advantages</p>
<p>A large fraction of the profitability associated with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>, 
              and to a lesser degree that associated with any new MNT product, 
              is likely to occur during the period of initial release. This is 
              true because MNT products often will solve problems cleanly and 
              completely, leaving no significant vestigial market. For instance, 
              one of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> nanomedical devices produced using MNT is 
              likely to be a powder of biocompatible glucose <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> fuel cells 
              with internal temperature sensors to avoid excess waste heat and 
              a binding site for later removal from the bloodstream. The purpose 
              of this device would be simply to burn fuel, producing waste heat. 
              From the public's perspective it will be a rapid weight loss infusion 
              capable of safely producing one to two pounds of weight loss per 
              day (or several times that in extremely cold weather or while the 
              body is immersed in cool water). Once this system is safely developed 
              and successfully marketed, the market effectively will be gone. 
              People may continue to become overweight, but the world's accumulated 
              pool of overweight people willing to use nanomedicine will be expended. 
              Those overweight people who are reluctant to use new medical technologies 
              will surely still prefer, when they eventually decide to use one, 
              to use the established brand even if it costs somewhat more than 
              its competition, as its safety will have been more thoroughly established. 
              Furthermore, later nanomedical devices will incorporate the weight 
              loss function as a mere side effect of their other capabilities, 
              making this design obsolete. In other fields, the advantages from 
              safety, branding, superior R&amp;D, and expansion into a technological 
              frontier will not favor the first mover as completely, but it is 
              a basic economic result that, all else being equal, oligopoly quantity 
              competition leaves first movers with dominant market share even 
              in the long run.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Given the above result, are competing MNT producers likely to engage 
              in the alternation of <i>de facto</i> collusion and quantity or 
              monopolistic competition typical of contemporary oligopolies? The 
              simple answer is yes, at least in the short term, as this behavior 
              maximizes short run profits for all competitors under the <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              imposed by antitrust law and <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Prisoner\'s Dilemma')">prisoner's dilemma</a>s. However, MNT will 
              be associated with novel productive powers that may call the default 
              assumption into doubt. For instance, the traditional MNT vision 
              of home manufacturing, the software metaphor of unlimited manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> matching production precisely to demand, and even the growing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of online <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a>-based purchasing all suggest price competition 
              as a plausible alternative. Still, there seem to be few large examples 
              of actual price competition in the world of retail, even where they 
              would be most expected, such as in the sale of bottled water, public 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> IP, <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">internet</a> retailing, and the like. Even freelance service 
              work such as housekeeping, therapy, tutoring, and most other examples 
              of work by the self employed are far from perfectly competitive, 
              with agencies matching consumers to producers and keeping large 
              commissions and with many producers spending more time <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/client_entry.html">client</a>s than working, and demanding far more for an hour of 
              work than the value of an hour of their time.</p>
<p>By reducing the scale of manufacture, in addition to improving 
              the ability to match supply to demand, MNT and nanoblock<sup>4</sup> 
              assembly seem likely to produce a world where retail is relatively 
              more important and wholesale less. Wal-Mart or its successor still 
              may sell MNT-built products, but if they do, they probably will 
              sell them primarily through large factory/grocery stores rather 
              than from giant wholesale stores, as the combination of a nanofactory 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments for trying out products will greatly 
              reduce the necessary floor space and inventory space. It is also 
              reasonable to suggest that members of a much wealthier <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> will 
              be less inclined to travel substantial distances in order to shop, 
              and less likely to accept uninteresting work for under ten dollars 
              an hour. Smaller stores that offer a better atmosphere and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able 
              service thus will have both more customers and less difficulty finding 
              employees. As a result, brands will be easily differentiated and 
              price competition will be even less prevalent than it is today.</p>
<p>The sale of energy will provide the first MNT mover with yet another 
              advantage over later competitors. If claims can be established to 
              solar energy streams sufficient to satisfy global energy demand, 
              and environmental laws can be passed to restrict the utilization 
              of solar energy streams other than those initially tapped, competitors 
              may have to pay a larger amount for solar energy inputs than first 
              movers.</p>
<p>At this point, it is still far from clear whether the developers 
              of MNT will or should choose to publicize their achievement. Their 
              decision probably will be driven in part by the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the company 
              that makes the final enabling innovations, and in part by the intensity 
              of the technological competition. If MNT is developed in a world 
              where it is still widely considered a retro-<a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> fantasy, competition 
              will be much less intense than in one where it is developed as the 
              result of intense international competition. I personally expect 
              a scenario reminiscent of that accompanying the birth pangs of the 
              airplane, i.e. many competitors all over the world but no very large 
              and competent concerted efforts aiming at a technology that was 
              still taken by consensus to be impossible despite a technological 
              infrastructure that was making its achievement noticeably less difficult 
              every year. In such a scenario, a private company that wishes to 
              utilize MNT productive capabilities will be able to do so rather 
              overtly without creating widespread awareness of what is happening. 
              Inexpensive solar panels are surely within the range of what they 
              can publicly produce, but rapidly deployed macroscale floating solar 
              oil factories are not. In a world where MNT is seen as completely 
              discredited, or in one where ubiquitous but mundane "nanotechnology" 
              had made Drexlerian predictions seem as quaint as those once made 
              about nuclear energy or space travel, even the solar oil factories 
              might not lead to widespread correct conclusions without an accurate 
              explanation; conversely, if MNT was the 21<sup>st</sup> century's 
              space race, there would be little point in secrecy and every reason 
              to develop and market all important applications possible applications 
              as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is hard to imagine a world where the replacement 
              of traditional industry by molecular manufacturing is taken for 
              granted by everyone even moderately <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>-oriented in the same 
              way that today all such people see as inevitable the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> replacement 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ue film-making, Chinese dominance of durable goods manufacture, 
              or the transition to HDTV. The economic and political havoc that 
              would be expected to result from a widespread belief in truly radically 
              near future change is difficult to calculate, and might even be 
              sufficient to make such a prophesy self-preventing. For this reason 
              among others, it is fair to say that even weeks after the development 
              of MNT is announced, the majority of investors still will not know 
              about it. Even those who do will probably understand it less well 
              than today's typical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> author, and will thus not base 
              any informed investment decisions on their knowledge of MNT. It 
              is also easy to imagine a near-future world filled with constant 
              inaccurate claims of MNT breakthroughs, such that accurate information 
              would not trigger immediate market adjustments upon its release.</p>
<h2>Part 2: MNT Risk Management</h2>
<h3>Economic Disruption</h3>
<p>Much has been made of the large number of jobs that might be eliminated 
              with the advent of molecular manufacturing. If all or nearly all 
              jobs were to rapidly become unnecessary, the resulting economic 
              disruption would not necessarily cause major hardship, as some have 
              feared. However, most work is not associated with the production 
              of products that can easily be replaced by MNT. Instead, early MNT 
              products will almost eliminate certain sectors, such as manufacturing; 
              will greatly reduce the need for workers in some others, such as 
              mining, utilities, construction, and <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>/warehousing 
              of goods; will have little direct impact on the demand for work 
              in some fields, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al services, management, and food 
              services; and will greatly increase the demand for a few professions, 
              especially <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> and possibly scientific and technical 
              services. Theoretically, capital can be substituted for most varieties 
              of labor, and MNT also will greatly expand the ease of creation 
              of capital while devaluing existing capital, but it will take time 
              for new capital to replace most workers. For instance, in the short 
              term, trash-collecting robots are unlikely, but in the long term, 
              home recycling and incineration units are likely.</p>
<p>I estimate that MNT will make 10% - 20% of all current US jobs 
              obsolete within a year of development, 20% - 40% within two years, 
              and in the absence of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> will make 60% - 80% of current work 
              unnecessary within a decade of development, as more powerful tools 
              multiply the capabilities of service workers in fields like waste 
              management and accommodations/food services. Many workers probably 
              will be retained by their employers for months or years after their 
              services are no longer necessary due either to contractual stipulations 
              or simply to slow managerial reaction times. In addition, laws may 
              be passed further restricting the elimination of jobs, but ultimately 
              obsolete industries will disappear even with government life support 
              and will eliminate jobs by closing if they can't do so with layoffs.</p>
<p>At the same time that many jobs disappear, so will many workers. 
              Great uncertainty, high discount rates, high interest rates, and 
              novel low cost lifestyle options will provide many workers with 
              strong incentives to leave their jobs and either retire or try to 
              found businesses more suited to the new economy. This will drive 
              the expenses faced by many employers upwards, as noted earlier, 
              but will do little to mitigate the problem of unemployment, as the 
              workers who have the capital to invest and retire are by definition 
              not those most threatened by the loss of their jobs and typically 
              cannot be easily replaced by even larger numbers of inappropriately 
              trained workers.</p>
<p>Most of the neediest workers will be covered by state unemployment 
              insurance, which will have the added benefit of increasing non-discretionary 
              governmental spending. Increases in the duration of unemployment 
              payouts should be lobbied for, but even if these are successful, 
              more will be needed. Further subsidies for the unemployed may be 
              possible through investments in companies (such as MyRichUncle.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>) 
              that give loans in exchange to a fraction of the borrower's future 
              earnings. However, several million people still will be in need 
              of both money to live on and meaningful work that they are not able 
              to find for themselves. Dealing with those people is not a core 
              business function, but providing low cost goods to any agencies 
              that show competence in doing so (groups such as Habitat for Humanity, 
              etc.) probably will be a very sound investment in good will.</p>
<p>By contrast, although it would be possible to support all of the 
              displaced people or hire them for make-work, spending money directly 
              to do so generally would be expected to aggravate the resentment 
              that was supposed to be mitigated. One of the most important things 
              to do when mitigating resentment is to work hard to fight the impression 
              that people with MNT can do anything and that all remaining problems 
              are therefore their fault. For PR purposes, it is probably best 
              to downplay what the technology is capable of. This also will tend 
              to reduce governmental fear, public paranoia, and pressure to share 
              dangerous technologies with militaries that cannot be trusted with 
              them.<br>
</p>
<h3>Abuse of Novel Capabilities</h3>
<p>The second major class of risk that must be avoided is that associated 
              with intentional abuse. This includes everything from the production 
              of self-replicating robots to rapid military build-ups to universal 
              intrusive surveillance (even, possibly, surveillance of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> activity, 
              hence of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s). The extreme number of potentially disastrous 
              abuses that MNT lends itself to is a very strong argument for making 
              every possible effort to either maintain secrecy regarding MNT techniques, 
              or at least to limiting access to extremely trustworthy parties. 
              Many other essays in this collection will discuss the consequences 
              of failing to maintain secrecy, but for the purposes of this paper, 
              it should suffice to assert that so long as MNT remains tightly 
              controlled these risks should be manageable.<br>
</p>
<h3>Dangerous Consequences of Excessive Computing Power</h3>
<p>The final and most critical danger associated with MNT is that 
              it will lead to the release of massive computing power and the acquisition 
              of neurological knowledge that will make it easier to develop AI 
              (artificial intelligence) than to control it, leading to a total 
              loss of control and human extinction. It is obviously best to respond 
              to this by being extremely judicious with respect to the distribution 
              of devices for studying the brain and by limiting the available 
              computing power available for a dollar to a level significantly 
              greater than that being produced by competing companies but far 
              less than what could be made available. It is best if the gap between 
              available MNT computers and traditional</p>
<p>9 computers is great enough to dominate the market and end incremental 
              development of computing power, but small enough not to contribute 
              substantially to reducing the cost of parallel projects aimed at 
              developing MNT or AI. Despite such precautions, MNT development 
              will accelerate AI development in many ways. The most significant 
              of these may be the increased ability to spend time on long-term 
              personal projects resulting from increased personal <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>.</p>
<p>The largest risks are likely to be of an internal origin, as some 
              of the thousands of researchers in the company may attempt to evolve 
              an AI on internal nanocomputers. An obvious way to ameliorate this 
              problem is to limit design and production to low power computers, 
              or to dedicated computers for running molecular simulations and 
              designing products, or for other very specific purposes. In the 
              long run though, this is a stopgap measure. Some strategy must be 
              developed for ensuring that mankind is not accidentally wiped out 
              by an AI. The scope of this problem goes beyond that of this paper, 
              but it is probably a good starting place to assert the desirability 
              of doing whatever is possible to direct global R&amp;D towards the 
              development of technology for making people more intelligent and 
              away from technology for making machines more intelligent.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it does appear that AI can be developed safely and 
              that preventing unsafe AI permanently should be possible, but it 
              also appears that the level of intelligence required to safely develop 
              AI is approximately independent of the available level of computing 
              power, while that required to unsafely develop AI decreases with 
              computing power. For this reason, increasing intelligence and reducing 
              available computing power both contribute to risk <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>. Anti-aging 
              technology also may contribute, because it provides a <i>de facto</i> 
              increase in the amount of thought that a person can ultimately apply 
              to any given problem, although the development of anti-aging technology 
              will be strongly commercially and PR driven in any event, and thus 
              requires no further justification. </p>

<p>3. In price competition, producers compete to sell for the lowest 
              possible price. They choose what price they will sell at and then 
              sell as many as the public demands at that price. In practice, this 
              requires that the company be able to match supply precisely to demand. 
              Economically this is equivalent to perfect competition and eliminates 
              all profit. In quantity competition, producers sell undifferentiated 
              products to wholesalers, setting the quantity sold to maximize profits. 
              As the number of competitors increases this becomes more like perfect 
              competition because each producer has increasingly little incentive 
              to restrict quantity in order to maintain demand. By committing 
              to a particular level of production in advance, earlier entrants 
              can establish equilibria where they sell larger volumes than later 
              entrants. With a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> demand curve, each entrant will sell half 
              the volume of its predecessor. In monopolistic competition, companies 
              sell similar but branded goods and use marketing and reputation 
              to maintain a willingness to pay a premium over the market price 
              for branded products. Branded goods are imperfect substitutes with 
              high cross elasticities of demand, so as the price of one brand 
              increases, consumers gradually <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> over to its competition.</p>
