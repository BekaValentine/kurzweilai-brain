<br><p>Originally published 1998 in the book <i><a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">Cyborg</a> Babies: From Techno-<a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">Sex</a> to Techno-Tots</i>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 23, 2001.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a> (1960) showed us the degree to which it is the business of childhood to take the objects in the world and use how they "work" to construct theories--of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, number, causality, <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, and mind. Fifty years ago, when Piaget was formulating his theories, a child's world was full of things that could be understood in simple, mechanical ways. A bicycle could be understood in terms of its pedals and gears, a wind-up car in terms of its clockwork springs. Children were able to take <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> radios and (with some difficulty) bring them into this "mechanical"<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>of understanding. Since the end of the 1970s, however, with the introduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> toys and games, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of objects and how children understand them have changed. When children today remove the back of their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> toys to "see" how they work, they find a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, a battery, and some wires. Sensing that trying to understand these objects "physically" will lead to a dead end, children try to use a "psychological" kind of understanding (Turkle 1984:29-63). Children ask themselves if the games are conscious, if the games know, if they have feelings, and even if they "cheat." Earlier objects encouraged children to think in terms of a distinction between the world of <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> and the world of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> does not. Its "opacity" encourages children to see <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects as psychological <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>Over the last twenty years I have observed and interviewed hundreds of children as they have interacted with a wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects, from <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s on the screen to robots off the screen (Turkle 1984, 1995). My methods are ethnographic and clinical. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, I began by observing children playing with the first generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> toys and games. In the 1990s, I have worked with children using a new generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> games and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and experimenting with on-line <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Among the first generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects was Merlin, which challenged children to games of tic-tac-toe. For children who had only played games with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> opponents, reaction to this object was intense. For example, while Merlin followed an optimal strategy for winning tic-tac-toe most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it was <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to make a slip every once in a while. So when children discovered a strategy that would sometimes allow them to win, and then tried it again, it usually didn't work. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> gave the impression of not being "dumb enough" to let down its defenses twice. Robert, seven, playing with his friends on the beach, watched his friend Craig perform the "winning trick," but when he tried it, Merlin did not make its slip and the game ended in a draw. Robert, confused and frustrated, accused Merlin of being a cheating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>." Children were used to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s being predictable. But this <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> surprised.</p>
<p>Robert threw Merlin into the sand in anger and frustration. "Cheater. I hope your brains break." He was overheard by Craig and Greg, aged six and eight, who salvaged the by-now-very-sandy toy and took it upon themselves to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> Robert straight. Craig offered the opinion that "Merlin doesn't know if it cheats. It won't know if it breaks. It doesn't know if you break it, Robert. It's not alive." Greg adds: "It's smart enough to make the right kinds of noises. But it doesn't really know if it loses. That's how you can cheat it. It doesn't know you are cheating. And when it cheats, it doesn't even know it's cheating." Jenny, six, interrupted with disdain: "Greg, to cheat you have to know you are cheating. Knowing is part of cheating.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, such scenes were not unusual. Confronted with objects that spoke, strategized, and "won," children were led to argue the moral and metaphysical status of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s on the basis of their psychologies: Did the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s know what they were doing? Did they have intentions, <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, and feelings? These first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that entered children's lives were evocative objects: they became the occasion for new formulations about the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and the mechanical. For despite Jenny's objections that "knowing is part of cheating," children did come to see <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects as exhibiting a kind of knowing. She was part of a first generation of children who were willing to invest <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with qualities of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as they rethought the question of what is alive in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of "<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that think."</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, the objects of children's lives have come to include <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of even greater <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, toys and games and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that make these first cybertoys seem primitive in their ambitions. The answers to the classical Piagetian question of how children think about <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> are being renegotiated as they are posed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects that explicitly present themselves as exemplars of "<a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>."</p><h1>1. FROM <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">PHYSICS</a> TO <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">PSYCHOLOGY</a></h1><p>Piaget, studying children in the world of "traditional"--that is, non-<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al--objects, found that as children matured, they homed in on a definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> which centered around "moving of one's own accord." First, everything that moved was taken to be alive, then only things that moved without an outside push or pull. Gradually, children refined the notion of "moving of one's own accord" to mean the "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> motions" of breathing and metabolism. This meant that only those things that breathed and grew were taken to be alive. But from the first generation of children who met <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> toys and games (the children of the late 1970s and early 1980s), there was a disruption in this classical story. Whether or not children <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were alive, they were sure that how the toys moved was not at the heart of the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. Children's discussions about the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s aliveness came to center on what the children perceived as the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s psychological rather than physical properties. To put it too simply, motion gave way to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> gave way to <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> as criteria for aliveness.</p>
<p>Today, only a decade later, children have learned to say that their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are "just <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s," but they continue to <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> psychological properties to them. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects are said to have qualities (such as having intentions and ideas) that were previously reserved for people. Thus today's children seem comfortable with a reconstruction of the notion of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>" which includes having a <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>. And children often use the phrase "sort of alive" to describe the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>An eleven-year-old named Holly watches a group of robots navigate a maze. The robots use different strategies to reach their goal, and Holly is moved to comment on their "personalities" and their "cuteness." She finally comes to speculate on the robots' "aliveness" and blurts out an unexpected formulation: "It's like Pinocchio."</p>
<blockquote>First Pinocchio was just a puppet. He was not alive at all. Then he was an alive puppet. Then he was an alive boy. A real boy. But he was alive even before he was a real boy. So I think the robots are like that. They are alive like Pinocchio [the puppet], but not "real boys."</blockquote>
<p>She sums up her <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>: "They [the robots] are sort of alive."</p>
<p>In September 1987, more than one hundred scientists and technical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers gathered together in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to found a discipline devoted to working on <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that might cross the boundary between "sort of" to "really" alive. They called their new enterprise "<a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>."</p>
<p>From the outset, many of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>'s pioneers developed their ideas by writing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s on their <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s. These <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, easily shipped off on <a class="thought" href="entries/floppy_disk_entry.html">floppy disk</a>s or shared via the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, have revolutionized the social diffusion of ideas. Christopher Langton (1989:13), one of the founders of the discipline of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, argued that <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> relies on unanticipated bottom-up effects: simple rules interacting to give rise to complex behavior. He further argued that <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> would only be successful if it shared this aesthetic of "emergent effects" with <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>The cornerstone idea of decentralized, bottom-up emergence is well illustrated by a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> written in the mid-1980s known as "boids." Its author, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> animator Craig Reynolds, wanted to explore whether flocking behavior, whether in fish, birds, or <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, might happen without a flock leader or the intention to flock. Reynolds wrote a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that caused virtual birds to flock, in which each "bird" acted "solely on the basis of its local perception of the world" (1987:27). Reynolds called the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> birds "boids," an extension of high-tech jargon that refers to generalized objects by adding the suffix "oid." A boid could be any flocking creature. Each "boid" was given three simple rules: (1) if you are too close to a neighboring boid, move away from it; (2) if not as fast as your neighboring boid, speed up; if not as slow as your neighboring boid, slow down; (3) if you are moving toward the greater density of boids, maintain direction; if not, do so. The rules working together created flocks of boids that could fly around obstacles and change direction. The boids <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> posed the evocative question: How could it be established that the behavior produced by the boids (behavior to which it was easy to <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> intentionality and leadership) was different from behavior in the natural world? Were <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s following simple rules that led to their complex "lifelike" behavior. Were people following simple rules that led to their complex "lifelike" behavior?</p>
<p>In writing about the dissemination of ideas about microbes and the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>] theory of disease in late-nineteenth-century France, the sociologist of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> Bruno Latour (1988) argued that the message of Louis Pasteur's writings was less significant than the social deployment of an army of "hygienists," state employees who visited every French farm to spread the word. The hygienists were the "foot soldiers" of Pasteur's revolution. In the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> the foot soldiers are "shippable" products in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> games, and small robots, some of which are sold as toys. I do not argue that these products are <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, but that they are significant actors for provoking a new discourse about aliveness. <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> toys and games introduced <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> into children's categories for talking about the "quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>"; a new generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects is introducing ideas about decentralization and emergence.</p><h1>2. "ALIVE" ON THE SCREEN</h1><p>In the mid-1980s, the biologist Thomas Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> world in which self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> creatures could evolve by themselves. Ray imagined that the motor for the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the artificial organisms would be their competition for <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">central processing unit</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The less <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> organism needed to replicate, the more "fit" it would be in its "natural" <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> environment. Ray called hissystemTierra, the Spanish word for "<a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>."</p>
<p>In January 1990, Ray wrote the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>program for his first <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> creature. It consisted of eighty instructions. It evolved progeny which could replicate with even fewer instructions. This meant that these progeny were "fitter" than their ancestor because they could compete better in an environment where <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> was scarce. Further <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> produced ever smaller self-replicating creatures, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>  "parasites" that passed on their genetic material by latching onto larger <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> organisms. When some host organisms developed immunity to the first generation of parasites, new kinds of parasites were born. For Ray, asystemthat self-replicates and is capable of open-ended <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is alive. From this point of view, Rav believed that Tierra, running on his Toshiba laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, was indeed alive.</p>
<p>Ray made Tierra available on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, ready for "<a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing" via modem. And it was <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed all over the world, often to school <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> clubs and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> classes. A fifteen-year-old high school student said that working with Tierra made him feel as though he were "looking at cells through an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> microscope. I know that it is all happening in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but I have to keep reminding myself." Tierra was an object-to-think-with for considering <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> as essential to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. "You <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> it up and you let it go. And a whole world starts," said the student. "I have to keep reminding myself that it isn't going to jump out of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. . . . I dreamt that I would find little <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s in there. Two times I ran it at night, but it's not such a great idea because I couldn't really sleep."</p>
<p>Ray could not predict the developments that would take place in his <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">SYSTEM</a>. He too stayed up all night, watching new processes evolve. The lifelike behavior of his <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> Tierrans emerged from the "bottom up." At MIT's <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Laboratory, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er Mitchel Resnick worked to bring the <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> aesthetic into the world of children. He began by giving them a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> construction kit that included sensors and motors as well as standard Lego blocks. Children quickly <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>d lifelike properties to their creations. Children experienced one little <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> as "confused" because it moved back and forth between two points (because of rules that both told it to seek out objects and to move away quickly if it sensed an object). Children classified other robots as nervous, frightened, and sad. The first Lego-Logo robots were tethered by cables to a "mother" <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but eventually <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers were able to give the robots an "onboard" <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. The resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> made the Lego-Logo creations seem far less like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and far more like creatures. For the children who worked with them, this <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> further suggested that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s might be creatures and creatures might be <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p>Resnick also developed <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s, among these a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> he called StarLogo that would enable children to control the parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s of many hundreds of "creatures" on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen. Traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s follow one instruction at a time; with Resnick's StarLogo <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, multiple instructions were followed at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, simulating the way things occur in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. And as in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, simple rules led to complex behaviors. For example, a population of screen "termites" in an environment of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> "wood chips" were given a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of two rules: if you're not carrying anything and you bump into a wood <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, pick it up; if you're carrying a wood <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> and you bump into another wood <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, put down the <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> you're carrying. Imposing these two rules at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> will cause the screen termites to make wood <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> piles (Resnick 1992:76). So children were able to get the termites to stockpile woodchips without ever giving the termites a command to do so. Similarly, children could use StarLogo to model birds in a flock, ants in a colony, cars in a traffic jam--all situations in which complex behavior emerges from the interaction of simple rules. Children who worked with these materials struggled to describe the quality of emergence that their objects carried. "In this version of Logo," said one, "you can get more [out of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>] than what you tell it to do" (Resnick 1992:131-132).</p>
<p>An object such as StarLogo opens up more than new technical possibilities: it gives children concrete material for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in what Resnick has termed a "decentralized mindset." The key principle here is <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a>--<a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> results although there is no top-down intervention or control. In a centralized model of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> designs the process, sets it in motion, and keeps close tabs to make sure it conforms to design. In a decentralized model, <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> can be there, but in the details: simple rules whose interactions result in the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>StarLogo teaches how decentralized rules can be the foundation for behavior that may appear to be "intentional" or a result of "following the leader." It also provides a window onto resistance to decentralized <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. When confronted with the wood <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> piles, Resnick reports that most adults prefer to assume that a leader stepped in to direct the process or that there was an asymmetry in the world that gave rise to a pattern, for example, a food source near the final location of a stockpile (Resnick, Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams: 137ff). In reflecting on this resistance to ideas about decentralization, Resnick (1992:122) cites the historian of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> Evelyn Fox Keller who, in reviewing the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of resistance to decentralized ideas in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, was led to comment: "We risk imposing on <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> the very stories we like to hear."</p>
<p>Why do we like to hear centralized stories? There is our Western monotheistic tradition; there is our experience over millennia of large-scale societies governed by centralized authority and controlled through centralized bureaucracy; there is our experience of ourselves as unitary and intentional actors (the ego as "I"); and there is also the fact that we have traditionally lacked concrete objects in the world with which to think about decentralization. Objects such as StarLogo present themselves as objects to think with for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about emergent phenomena and decentralized control. As a wider range of such objects enter our culture, the balance between our tendency to assume decentralized emergence or centralized command may change. The children who tinkered with parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> became comfortable with the idea of multiple processes and decentralized methods. Indeed, they came to enjoy this "quality of emergence" and began to associate it with the quality of aliveness.</p>
<p>The idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts has always been resonant with religious and <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>ual meaning. Decentered, emergent phenomena combine a feeling that one knows the rules with the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that one cannot predict the outcome. To children, emergent phenomena seem almost magical because one can know what every individual object will do but still have no idea of what thesystemas a whole will look like. This is the feeling that the children were expressing when they described getting "more out" of the StarLogo <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> than they told it to do. The children know that there are rules behind the magic and that there is magic in the rules. In a <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, objects are re-enchanted.</p>
<p>When children <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming in StarLogo got a group of objects on the screen to clump together in predictable groups by commanding them to do so, they did not consider this "interesting" in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that it did not seem "lifelike." But if they gave the objects simple rules that had no obvious relation to clumping behavior but clumping "happened" all the same, that behavior did seem lifelike. So, for children working in the StarLogo <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> culture, "teaching" <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> birds to flock by explicitly telling them where to go in every circumstance seemed to be a kind of "cheating." They were developing an "ethic of simulation" in which decentralization and emergence became requirements for things to seem "alive enough" to be interesting.</p>
<p>In this example, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> show their potential to generate new ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. Just as children exposed to <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> toys and games begin to think differently about the definition of aliveness (<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> rather than physical motion), so children exposed to <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a> begin to think about <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in terms of emergent phenomena.</p><h1>3. THE "SIMS"</h1><p>The authors of the "Sim" series of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> games (among these SimAnt, SimCity, Sim-Health, SimLife) write explicitly of their effort to use the games to communicate ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> (Bremer 1991:163). For example, in the most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> game of SimAnt (played on one "patch" of a simulated backyard), a player learns about local bottom-up determination of behavior: each ant's behavior is determined by its own state, its assay of its direct neighbors, and a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules. Like Reynolds's "boids" and the objects in StarLogo, the ants change their state in reference to who they are and with whom they are in contact. SimAnt players learn about pheromones, the virtual tracer chemicals by which ants, as well as Resnick's StarLogo objects, "communicate" with one another. Beyond this, SimAnt players learn how in certain circumstances, local <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s that seem benign (mating a few ants) can lead to disastrous global results (population overcrowding and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>). Children playing Sim games make a connection between the individual games and some larger <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of ideas. Tim, a thirteen-year-old player, says of SimLife: "You get to mutate plants and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s into different <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> . . . . You are part of something important. You are part of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>." As for the Sim creatures themselves, Tim thinks that the "<a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s that grow in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could be alive," although he adds, "This is kind of spooky."</p>
<p>Laurence, a more blas&#233; fifteen-year-old, doesn't think the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on the screen is spooky at all. "The whole point of this game," he tells me,</p>
<blockquote>is to show that you could get things that are alive in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. We get <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> from the sun. The organisms in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> get <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> from the plug in the wall. I know that more people will agree with me when they make a SimLife where the creatures are smart enough to communicate. You are not going to feel comfortable if a creature that can talk to you goes extinct.</blockquote>
<p>Robbie, a ten-year-old who has been given a modem for her birthday, uses her experience of the game to develop some insight into those <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> processes that led adults to use the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>" for <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that "traveled." She puts the emphasis on mobility instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> when she considers whether the creatures she has evolved on SimLife are alive.</p>
<blockquote>I think they are a little alive in the game, but you can turn it off and you cannot "save" your game, so that all the creatures you have evolved go away. But if they could figure out how to get rid of that part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> so that you would have to save the game and if your modem were on, then they could get out of your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and go to America Online.</blockquote>
<p>Sean, thirteen, who has never used a modem, comes tip with a variant on Robbie's ideas about SimLife creatures and their <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> travel: "The [Sim] creatures could be more alive if they could get into DOS."</p>
<p>In Piaget's classical studies of the 1920s on how children <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about what was alive, the central variable was motion. Simply put, children took up the question of an object's "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> status" by asking themselves if the object could move of its own accord. When in the late 1970s and early 1980s I studied children's reactions to a first generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> objects which were physically "stationary" but which nonetheless accomplished impressive feats of cognition (talking, spelling, doing math, and playing tic-tac-toe), I found that the focus had shifted to an object's psychological properties when children considered the question of its "aliveness." Now, in children's comments about the creatures that exist on simulation games, the emphasis is on <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. But this emphasis also includes a recapitulation of criteria that draw from <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>. Children talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> "travel" via circulating disks or over modems. They talk of viruses and <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and motion are resurfacing in a new guise, now bound up in the ideas of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Significantly, the resurfacing of motion (Piaget's classical criterion) is bound up with notions of presumed <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>: children were most likely to assume that the creatures on Sim games have a desire to "get out" of thesystemand evolve in a wider <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al world.</p><h1>4. "CYCLING THROUGH"</h1><p>Although the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects disrupted the classical Piagetian story for talking about aliveness, the story children were telling about <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects in the early 1980s had its own coherency. Faced with intelligent toys, children took a new world of objects and imposed a new world <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, based not on <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> but on <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>. In the 1990s, that <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> has been strained to the breaking point. Children will now talk about <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as "just <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s" but describe them as <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> and intentional. Faced with ever-more-complex <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects, children are now in the position of theoretical bricoleurs, or tinkerers, "making do" with whatever materials are at hand, "making do" with whatever theory can fit a prevailing circumstance. They cycle through <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> and resurface ideas about motion in terms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> of bits.</p>
<p>My current collection of comments about <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> by children who have played with small mobile robots, the games of the "Sim" series, and Tierra includes the following notions: the robots are in control but not alive, would be alive if they had bodies, are alive because they have bodies, would be alive if they had feelings, are alive the way <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s are alive but not the way people are alive; the Tierrans are not alive because they are just in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, could be alive if they got out of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, are alive until you turn off the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and then they're dead, are not alive because nothing in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is real; the Sim creatures are not alive but almost-alive, they would be alive if they spoke, they would be alive if they traveled, they're alive but not real," they're not alive because they don't have bodies, they are alive because they can have babies, and, finally, for an eleven-year-old who is relatively new to SimLife, they're not alive because these babies don't have parents. She says: "They show the creatures and the game tells you that they have mothers and fathers but I don't believe it. It's just numbers, it's not really a mother and a father." There is a striking heterogeneity of theory here. Different children hold different theories, and individual children are able to hold different theories at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>The heterogeneity of children's views is apparent when they talk about something as "big" as the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al creature and about something as "small" as why a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med with "emergent" methods might move in a certain way. One fifth-grader named Sara jumped back and forth from a psychological to a mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> when she talked about the Lego-Logo creature she had built. When Sara considered whether her <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> would sound a signal when its "touch sensor" was pushed, she said: "It depends on whether the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> wants to tell . . . if we want the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to tell us . . . if we tell the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to tell us" (Resnick 1989:402). In other words, within a few seconds, Sara "cycled through" three perspectives on her creature (as psychological being, as intentional self, as <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> of its <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer's intentions). The speed of her alternations suggests that these perspectives are equally present for her at all times. For some purposes, she finds one or another of them more useful.</p>
<p>In the short <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has changed the way we think, it has often been children who have led the way. For example, in the early 1980s, children--prompted by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> toys that spoke, did math, and played tic-tac-toe--disassociated ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> from ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, something that historically had not been the case. These children were able to contemplate <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that were not alive, a position that grownups are only now beginning to find comfortable. Today's <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> children are taking things even further; they are pointing the way toward a radical heterogeneity of theory in the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s that evoke "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>." In his <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a>, Steven Levy (1992:6-7) suggested that one way to look at where <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> can "fit in" to our way of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is to envisage a continuum in which Tierra, for example, would be more alive than a car but less alive than a bacterium. My observations suggest that children are not constructing hierarchies but are heading toward parallel, alternating definitions.</p>
<p>The development of heterogeneity in children's theories is of course taking place in a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. We are all living in the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al objects that carry emergent, decentralized theories and encourage a view of the self as fluid and multiple. Writers from many different disciplinary perspectives are arguing for a multiple and fluid notion of the self. Daniel <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Dennett (1991) argues for a "multiple drafts" theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. The presence of the drafts encourages a respect for the many different versions, and it imposes a certain distance from being identified with any one of them. No one aspect of self can be claimed as the absolute, true self. Robert Jay Lifton (1993) views the contemporary self as "protean," multiple yet integrated, allowing for a "<a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of self" without being one self. Donna Haraway equates a "split and contradictory self" with a "knowing self": "The knowing self is partial in all its guises, never finished, whole, simply there and original; it is always constructed and stitched together imperfectly; and therefore able to join with another, to see together without claiming to be another" (1991a:22). In <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al environments, such ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> and multiplicity are "brought down to <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>" and enter children's lives from their earliest days. Even the <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s they use to play games, to draw, and to write carries the message. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s "<a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>" have become a potent metaphor for <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about the self as a multiple and distributedsystem(Turkle 1995). <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> links have become a metaphor for a multiplicity of perspectives. On the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, people who participate in virtual communities may be "logged on" to several of them (open as several open-screen <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>) as they pursue other activities. In this way, they may come to experience their lives as a "cycling through" screen worlds in which they may be expressing different aspects of self. But such <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>-borne messages about multiple selves and theories are controversial.</p>
<p>Today's adults grew up in a psychological culture that equated the idea of a unitary self with psychological health and in a scientific culture that taught that when a discipline achieves maturity, it has a unifying theory. When adults find themselves cycling through varying perspectives on themselves ("I am my chemicals" to "I am my <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>" to "I am my genes"), they usually become uncomfortable (Kramer 1993: xii-xiii). But such alternations may strike the generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> children who are growing up today as "just the way things are."</p>
<p>Children speak easily about factors which encourage them to see the stuff" of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as the same "stuff" of which <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is made. Among these are the ideas of "shape shifting" and "morphing." Shape shifting is tile technique used by the evil <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/terminator_entry.html">Terminator</a> II to turn into the form of anything he touched--including people. A nine-year-old showed an alchemist's sensibility when lie explained how this occurs: "It is very simple. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, anything can turn to anything else when you have the right formula. So you can be a person one minute and a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> the next minute." Morphing is a general term that covers form changes which may include changes across the animate/inanimate barrier. A ten-year-old boy had a lot to say about morphing, all of it associated with the lifestyle of "The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers," a group of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> heroes who turn from teenagers to <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a>al/--mechanical "dinozords" and "megazords" and back. "Well," he patiently explains, "the dinozords are alive; the Power Rangers are alive, but not all the parts of the dinozords are alive, but all the parts of the Power Rangers are alive. The Power Rangers become the dinozords." Then, of course, there are seemingly omnipresent "transformer toys" which shift from being <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to being robots to being <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s (and sometimes people). Children play with these plastic and metal objects, and in the process they learn about the fluid boundaries between mechanism and flesh.</p>
<p>I observe a group of seven-year-olds playing with a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of plastic transformer toys that can take the shape of armored tanks, robots, or people. The transformers can also be put into intermediate states so that a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> arm can protrude from a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> form or a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> leg from a mechanical tank. Two of the children are playing with the toys in these intermediate states (that is, in their intermediate states somewhere between being people, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, and robots). A third child insists that this is not right. The toys, he says, should not be placed in hybrid states. "You should play them as all tank or all people." He is getting upset because the other two children are making a point of ignoring him. An eight-year-old girl comforts the upset child. "It's okay to play them when they are in between. It's all the same stuff," she says, "just yucky <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> cy-dough-plasm." This comment is the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> that characterizes today's children: a tendency to see <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s as "sort of" alive, to fluidly "cycle through" various explanatory concepts, and to willingly transgress boundaries.</p>
<p>Walt Whitman wrote: "A child went forth every day. And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became." When Piaget elaborated how the objects in children's lives constructed their psyches, he imagined a timeless, universal process. With the radical change in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of objects, the internalized lessons of the object world have changed. When today's adults "cycle through" different theories, they are uncomfortable. Such movement does not correspond to the unitary visions they were brought up to expect. But children have learned a different lesson from their <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> objects. Donna Haraway characterizes irony as being "about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes . . . about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true" (1991b:148). In this <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, today's <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a> children, growing up into irony, are becoming adept at holding incompatible things together. They are cycling through the cy-dough-plasm into fluid and emergent conceptions of self and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p><h1>References</h1><a name="r1"></a>
