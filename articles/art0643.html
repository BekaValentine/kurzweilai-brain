<div class="TeaserText">Nonbiological intelligence is multiplying by over 1,000 per decade. Once we can achieve the software of intelligence, which we will achieve through reverse-engineering the human brain, non-biological intelligence will soar past biological intelligence.  By the 2040s, nonbiological intelligence will be a billion times more powerful than the 10^26 computations per second that all biological humanity represents.</div>

              February 9, 2006. Reprinted on KurzweilAI.net February 10, 2006.</i><br>
</p>
<p> <i><b>Question 1:&#160; Tell us about your background. When did 
              you first work with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>?&#160; When did you first begin studying 
              computer/technological trends?</b></i> </p>
<p>I had the idea that I wanted to be an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> since I was five. 
              I first got involved with computers when I was twelve, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              some early computers, such as the 1401 and the 1620. I also built 
              computers out of telephone relays.</p>
<p>I began seriously modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> trends around 1980. I quickly 
              realized that timing is the critical factor in the success of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s. 
              Most technology projects fail not because the technology doesn&#8217;t 
              work, but because the timing is wrong&#8212;not all of the enabling 
              factors are at play where they are needed. So I began to study these 
              trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to anticipate what the world would be like in 3&#8211;5 
              or 10 years and make realistic assessments. That continued to be 
              the primary application of this study. I used these <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies 
              to guide the development plans of my projects, in particular when 
              to launch a particular project, so that the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> would be ready 
              when the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> was needed, the needs of the market, 
              and so on.</p>
<p>These methodologies had the side benefit of allowing us to project 
              development 20 or 30 years in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. There is a strong common 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> that you can&#8217;t predict the future, but that wisdom is incorrect. 
              Some key measures of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>&#8212;price-performance, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>&#8212;follow very smooth <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s. 
              I have been making predictions going back into the 1980s, when I 
              wrote <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a></i>. That book had hundreds 
              of predictions about the 1990s and 21<sup>st</sup> century based 
              on these models, which have turned out to be quite accurate. If 
              we know how much it will cost per million-instruction-per-second 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPs</a>) of computing in future points in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, or how much it will 
              cost to sequence a base-pair of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> or to model a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, or any 
              other measure of information technology at different points in time, 
              we can build scenarios of what will be feasible. The capability 
              of these technologies grows exponentially, essentially doubling 
              every year (depending on what you measure). There is even a slow 
              second level of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>.</p>
<p>We will increase the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of computing, which is already 
              formidable and deeply influential, by a factor of a billion in 25 
              years, and we will also shrink the technology at a predictable pace 
              of over one hundred in 3D volume per decade. So these technologies 
              will be very small and widely distributed, inexpensive, and extremely 
              powerful. Look at what we can do already, and multiply that by a 
              billion.</p>
<p><b><i>Question 2: When did you first become aware of the term &#8220;singularity?&#8221;&#160;Did 
              you use that term in your first book, </i>The Age of Intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s<i>?</i></b></p>
<p>No. I first became familiar with it probably around the late 1990s. 
              In my latest book, <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> is Near</i>, I have really 
              focused on the point in time where these technologies become quite 
              explosive and profoundly transformative. In my earlier book, <i>The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i>, I touched on that, and wrote about 
              computers achieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and what that would 
              mean. My main focus in this new book is on the merger of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              humanity with the technology that we are creating. Once <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> 
              intelligence gets a foothold in our bodies and brains, which we 
              have arguable already done in some people, but will do significantly 
              in the 2020s, it will grow exponentially. We have about 10<sup>26</sup> 
              calculations per second (cps) (at most 10<sup>29</sup>) in biological 
              humanity, and that figure won&#8217;t change much in the next fifty years. 
              Our brains use a form of electro-chemical signaling that travels 
              a few hundred feet per second, which is a million times slower than 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. The inter-<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al connections in our brains compute 
              at about 200 calculations per second, which is also about a million 
              times slower than electronics. We communicate our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and 
              skills using <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, which is similarly a million times slower 
              than computers can transmit <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. </p>
<p>So biological intelligence, while it could be better educated and 
              better organized, is not going to significantly change. Nonbiological 
              intelligence, however, is multiplying by over 1,000 per decade in 
              less than a decade. So once we can achieve the software of intelligence, 
              which we will achieve through reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, 
              non-biological intelligence will soar past biological intelligence. 
              But this isn&#8217;t an alien invasion, it is something that will literally 
              be deeply integrated in our bodies and brains. By the 2040s, the 
              nonbiological intelligence that we create that year will be a billion 
              times more powerful than the 10<sup>26 </sup>CPS that all biological 
              humanity represents. The word &#8220;singularity&#8221; is a metaphor, and the 
              metaphor that we are using isn&#8217;t really <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>, because these 
              exponentials are finite. The real meaning of &#8220;singularity&#8221; is similar 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the &#8220;event horizon&#8221; in <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>.&#160; A black 
              hole as physicists envision it has an <a class="thought" href="entries/event_horizon_entry.html">event horizon</a> around it, and 
              you can&#8217;t easily see past it. Similarly, it is difficult to see 
              beyond this technological event horizon, because it is so profoundly 
              transformative. </p>
<p><b><i>Question 3:&#160; Has there been one writer or <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er, 
              such as <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a>, who has had a predominant 
              influence on your <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>?</i></b> </p>
<p>Both those <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s have been influential. Vernor Vinge has 
              had some really key insights into the singularity very early on, 
              There were others, such as John Von Neuman, who talked about a singular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> occurring, because he had the idea of technological acceleration 
              and singularity half a century ago. But it was simply a casual comment, 
              and Vinge worked out some of the key ideas. </p>
<p>Marvin Minsky was actually my mentor, and I corresponded with him 
              and visited with him when I was in high school. We remain close 
              friends and colleagues, and many of his writings on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, 
              such as <i><a class="thought" href="entries/society_of_mind_entry.html">Society of Mind</a></i> and some of his more technical work, 
              have deeply influenced me.</p>
<p><b><i>Question 4:&#160; Many <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> analysts are predicting 
              that the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> will become the next major <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> industry. 
              When do you predict that the robotics industry will become a major, 
              thriving industry?</i></b> </p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> revolutions I write about, R nominally stands for robotics, 
              but the real reference is to <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>. By strong AI,&#160; I mean 
              artificial Intelligence at human levels, some of which will be manifested 
              in robots, and some of which will be manifested in virtual bodies 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. We will go into virtual reality environments, 
              and have <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in our brain that will shut down the signals coming 
              from our nerves and <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organs, and replace them with the signals 
              that we would be receiving if we were in the virtual environment. 
              We can be actors in this virtual environment, and have a virtual 
              body. But this <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_body_entry.html">virtual body</a> doesn&#8217;t need to be the same as our real 
              body. We will encounter other people in similar situations in this 
              VR. There will also be forms of AI which perform specific tasks, 
              like narrow AI programs do today in our economic infrastructure. 
              Our economic infrastructure would collapse if all these current 
              narrow AI programs stopped functioning, but this wasn&#8217;t true 25 
              years ago. So these task specific AI programs will become very intelligent 
              in the coming decades. </p>
<p>So strong AI won&#8217;t just be robots; that is only one manifestation. 
              The R revolution really is the strong AI revolution. Billions of 
              dollars of financial transactions are done every day, in the form 
              of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, automatic detection of credit card fraud, 
              and so forth. Every time you send an <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a> or make a telephone call, 
              intelligent algorithms route the information. Algorithms automatically 
              diagnose electrocardiograms and blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> images, fly airplanes, 
              guide &#8220;smart&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, and so forth. I give dozens of examples in 
              the book. These applications will become increasingly intelligent 
              in the decades ahead. Machines are already performing tasks that 
              previously could only be done by humans, and the tasks that this 
              covers will increase in the coming years. </p>
<p>In order to achieve strong AI, we need to understand how the human 
              brain works, and there are two fundamental requirements. One is 
              the hardware requirement, which you mentioned. It is relatively 
              uncontroversial today that we will achieve computer hardware equivalent 
              to the human brain&#8217;s computing capacity&#8212;just look at the semiconductor 
              industry&#8217;s own roadmap. This is a roadmap into which the semiconductor 
              industry has put enormous effort. By 2020, a single <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> will provide 
              10<sup>16</sup> instructions per second, sufficient to emulate a 
              single human brain.&#160;We will go to the third dimension, effectively 
              superseding the limits of Moore&#8217;s law, which deals only in 2-d integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s. These ideas were controversial notions when my last book 
              (<i>The Age of Spiritual Machines</i>) was published in 1999, but 
              is relatively uncontroversial today. </p>
<p>The more controversial issue is whether we will have the software, 
              because it is not sufficient to simply have powerful computers, 
              we need to actually understand how human intelligence works. That 
              doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean copying every single <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of every dendrite 
              and ion channel. It really means understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> principles 
              of how the human brain performs certain tasks, such as remembering, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing, recognizing patterns and so on. That is a grand project, 
              which I refer to as reverse-engineering the human brain, which is 
              far further along than many people realize. We see exponential growth 
              in every aspect of it. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the spatial resolution of brain 
              scanning is doubling every year in 3D volume. For the first time 
              we can actually see individual interneuronal connections in living 
              brains, and see them signaling in real time. This capability was 
              not feasible a few years ago. The amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that we are obtaining 
              on the brain is doubling every year, and we are showing that we 
              can turn this data into working models, and in the book I highlight 
              a couple of dozen simulations of different regions of the brain. 
              For example, there is now a simulation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cerebellum_entry.html">cerebellum</a>, which 
              is an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant region of the brain devoted to skill formation. 
              This region comprises over half of the neurons of the brain.</p>
<p>I make the case that we will have the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> understood 
              well within twenty years. At the end of the 2020s, we will have 
              both the hardware and software to create human levels of intelligence. 
              This includes <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al intelligence, which is really the cutting 
              edge of intelligence, in a machine. Given that machines are already 
              superior to humans in certain aspects, the human-intelligent computer 
              combination will be quite formidable, and this combination will 
              continue to grow exponentially. Nonbiological intelligence will

              design cycle.&#160; We are doing something like that now with <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, 
              by reading our genes. So in the GNR revolutions I write about, R 
              really stands for intelligence, which is the most powerful force 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. It is therefore the most influential of the revolutions.</p>
<p><b><i>Question 5: <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> plays a key role in your forecasts. 
              What advice would you give to someone wanting to invest today in 
              nanotechnology corporations?</i></b></p>
<p>Nanotechnology developments are currently in their formative stages. 
              There are early applications of nanotechnology, but these do not 
              represent the full vision of nanotechnology, the vision that Eric 
              Drexler articulated in 1986. No one was willing to supervise this 
              radical and interdisciplinary thesis except for my mentor Marvin 
              Minsky. We have shown the feasibility of manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> at 
              the molecular level, which is what <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> does. One of the ways 
              to create nanotechnology is to start with biological mechanisms 
              and modify them to extend the biological <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>&#8212;to go beyond 
              proteins. That vision of molecular nanotechnology assembly&#8212;of 
              using massively parallel, fully programmable processes to grow <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              with remarkable properties&#8212;is about twenty years away. There 
              will be a smooth <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion, and early adaptor applications, many 
              of which I discuss in the book. </p>
<p>There are early applications in terms of nanoparticles. These nanoparticles 
              have unique features due to nanosize <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, but this is a slightly 
              different concept. We are using the special properties of nanoscale 
              objects, but we are not actually building objects <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> by molecule. 
              So the real revolutionary aspect of nanotechnology is a couple of 
              decades away, and it is too early to say which companies will be 
              the leaders of that. Intel sees that the future of electronics is 
              nanotechnology, and by some definitions today&#8217;s electronics are 
              already nanotechnology. Undoubtedly, there will be small corporations 
              that will dominate. When <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s were formative, it would 
              have been difficult to foresee that two Stanford undergrads would 
              dominate that field. Nanotechnology is already a multi-billion dollar 
              industry which will continue growing as we get closer to molecular 
              manufacturing. When we actually have molecular manufacturing, it 
              will be transforming&#8212;we will be able to inexpensively manufacture 
              almost anything we need from feedstock materials and these information 
              processes. </p>
<p><b><i>Question 6:&#160; You write in </i>The Singularity is Near<i> 
              of feeling somewhat alone in your beliefs. How has the mainstream 
              scientific community responded to your prognostications?</i></b></p>
<p>Actually quite well. The book has been very well received; it has 
              gotten very positive reviews in mainstream publications such as 
              the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.&#160;It 
              has done very well, it has been #1 on the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> list at Amazon, 
              and ended up the fourth best selling science book of 2005 despite 
              coming out at the end of the year. The New York Times cited it as 
              the 13<sup>th</sup> most blogged about book of 2005.&#160;In terms 
              of group intellectual debate, I believe that it has gotten a lot 
              of respect, and has been well received. There are individuals who 
              don&#8217;t read the arguments and just read the conclusions. For some 
              of these individuals, the conclusions are so distant from the conventional 
              wisdom on these topics that they reject it out of hand. But for 
              those who carefully read the arguments, the response is generally 
              positive. This is not to say that everyone agrees with everything, 
              but it has gotten a lot of serious response and respect. I do believe 
              that these ideas are getting more widely distributed and accepted, 
              I am obviously not the only person articulating these concepts. 
              Nevertheless, the common wisdom is quite strong&#8212;even among 
              friends and associates, the common wisdom regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle and 
              the concept that life won&#8217;t be much different in the future than 
              it is today&#8212;still permeates people&#8217;s thinking. <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a>s and 
              statements regarding life&#8217;s brevity and senescence are still quite 
              influential.&#160;The deathist <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> (that <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> gives meaning to 
              life) is alive and well.&#160; </p>
<p>The biggest issue, which I put out in the beginning of <i>Singularity</i>, 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> vs. exponential thinking. It is remarkable how thoughtful 
              people, including leading scientists, think linearly. This is just 
              wrong, and I make this case, showing dozens of examples. But even 
              though someone may be an expert regarding one aspect of technology 
              or science, doesn&#8217;t mean that they have studied technology forecasting. 
              Relatively few <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s/prognosticators really have well-grounded 
              methodologies.&#160;The common wisdom is to think linearly, to assume 
              that the current pace of change will continue indefinitely. But 
              this attitude is gradually changing, as more and more people understand 
              the exponential perspective and how explosive an exponential can 
              be. That is the true <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of these technology trends. </p>
<p><b><i>Question 7:&#160; What about other technologies and industries, 
              such as the textile, aerospace, or automotive industries?&#160; 
              Are all technology fields experiencing exponential growth?</i></b></p>
<p>The key issue is that information technology and information processes 
              progress at an exponential pace. Biological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> itself was 
              an information process&#8212;the backbone is the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>, which 
              is a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> code. I show in my book how that has accelerated very 
              smoothly, in terms of the growth of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. The same thing is 
              true of technological evolution, when it has to do with information. 
              If we can measure the information <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, which we can readily 
              do with things like <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, then we can discern 
              that it progresses in this exponential fashion and subject to the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>. </p>
<p>The information technology needs to get to a point where it is 
              capable of transforming an industry, and biology is a good example. 
              Biology was not an information technology until recently&#8212;it 
              was basically hit or miss. Drug development was called drug discovery, 
              which meant that we didn&#8217;t know why a drug worked and we had no 
              theory of its operation. These drugs and tools were relatively crude 
              and had many negative side effects. 99.9% of the drugs on the market 
              were designed in this haphazard pre-information era fashion. </p>
<p>The new paradigm in biology is to understand these processes as 
              information processes, and to develop the tools to reprogram these 
              processes and actually change our genes. We still have these genetic 
              programs that are obsolete. The fat insulin receptor gene tells 
              the body to hold on to every <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a>, since it is programmed to 
              anticipate that the next hunting season may be a failure. That was 
              a good program 10,000 years ago, but is not a good program today. 
              We have shown in <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al studies with mice that we can change 
              those programs. There are many genes that we would like to turn 
              off, and there is also new genetic information that we would like 
              to insert.&#160;New gene therapy techniques are now beginning to 
              work. We can turn enzymes on and off, which are the workhorses of 
              biology, and there are many examples of that. Most current drug 
              development is through this rational drug design. So biology is 
              becoming an information technology, and we can see the clear exponential 
              growth. The amount of genetic data we sequence is doubling every 
              year, the speed with which we can sequence DNA is doubling every 
              year, and the cost has come down by half every year. It took 15 
              years to sequence the HIV <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, but we sequenced the SARS virus 
              in 31 days.&#160;AIDs drugs cost $30,000 per patient per year fifteen 
              years ago, but didn&#8217;t work very well. Now they&#8217;re down to $100 per 
              patient per year in poor countries and work much better. </p>
<p>Fields such as <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> are still not information technologies, but 
              that is going to change as well. For instance, in <i>Singularity</i> 
              I describe how we could meet 100% of our energy needs through renewable 
              energy with nanoengineered solar panels and fuel cells within twenty 
              years, by capturing only 3% of 1% of the sunlight that hits the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. That will happen within twenty years, and it will be related 
              to information technology, since it will be able to meet our energy 
              needs in a highly distributed, renewable, clean fashion with nanoengineered 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.&#160; We will ultimately transform <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a> in a 
              similar way, with nanoengineered devices that can provide personal 
              flying vehicles at very low cost.&#160;The transportation and energy 
              industries are currently pre-information fields. Ultimately, however, 
              information technologies will comprise almost everything of value, 
              because we will be able to build anything at extremely low cost 
              using nanoengineered materials and processes. We will have new methods 
              of doing things like flying and creating energy. </p>
<p><b><i>Question 8: You have emphasized the superior mechanical and

              first computers with nanotube components? </i></b></p>
<p>There is actually a nanotube-based <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> that may hit the market 
              next year.&#160;This is a dense, two-dimensional device that has 
              attractive properties. But three-dimensional devices are still about 
              one and a half decades away. There are alternatives to nanotubes, 
              such as DNA itself. DNA has potential uses outside of biology, because 
              of its affinity for linking to itself.&#160; DNA could also be used 
              structurally.&#160;But the full potential of three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s

<p><b><i>Question 9:&#160; Most predictions of future technological 
              developments have been inaccurate. What techniques do you use to

<p>I have a team of people that gathers data on many different industries 
              and phenomena, and we build mathematical models.&#160;More and more 
              areas of science and technology are now measurable in information 
              terms. I use a data-driven approach, and I endeavor to build theoretical 
              models of why these technologies progress. I have this theory of 
              the law of accelerating returns, which is a theory of evolution. 
              I then try to build mathematical models of how that applies to different 
              phenomena and industries. Most futurists don&#8217;t use this type of 
              methodology, and some just make guesses. Many futurists are simply 
              unaware of these trends&#8212;they make linear models. It is often 
              said that we overestimate what can be done in the short term, because 
              developing technologies turns out to be more difficult than we expect, 
              but dramatically underestimate what can be achieved in the long 
              term, because people think linearly. </p>
<p><b><i>Question 10:&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a> has traditionally played 
              a pivotal role in developing new technologies. Is the U.S. Government 
              doing enough to support the nascent nanotechnology or the AI industries? 
              Do these industries require Government support at this point?</i></b></p>
<p>These industries will both be propelled forward by the enormous 
              economic incentive. Nanotechnology will be able to create almost 
              any physical product we need at very low cost. These devices will 
              be quite powerful because they will have electronics and communications 
              embedded throughout the device. So there is tremendous economic 
              incentive to develop nanotechnology, and the same is true of artificial 
              intelligence. Basic research has an important role to play&#8212;the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, for instance, came out of the Arpanet. The new world wide 
              mesh concept&#8212;of having every device not simply connected to 
              the net but actually become a <a class="thought" href="entries/node_entry.html">node</a> on the net, sending and receiving 
              both its own and other people&#8217;s messages&#8212;this arose out of 
              a department of defense concept. It is now being adopted by civilian, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> corporations. <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> is actually playing a forward-looking 
              role in such technologies as speech recognition and other AI fields. 
            </p>
<p>In terms of national competitiveness, the key issue is that we 
              are not graduating enough scientists and engineers. The figures 
              regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of individuals receiving advanced technical degrees 
              are dramatically growing in China, Japan, Korea, and India. These 
              figures actually resemble exponential curves. China in particular 
              is greatly outpacing the U.S., producing scientists and engineers, 
              both at the undergraduate and doctoral level, in every scientific 
              field.&#160; Although this is a real concern, there is now one integrated 
              world economy, so we shouldn&#8217;t see this problem as simply the U.S. 
              vs. China. I am glad to see China and India economically engaged, 
              and this isn&#8217;t a zero-sum game&#8212;Chinese engineers are creating 
              value. But to the extent that we care about issues such as national 
              competitiveness, this is a concern. In the end, however, this is 
              about what fields teenagers choose to enter. </p>
<p>The U.S. does lead in the application of these technologies.&#160;I 
              speak at many conferences each year, including <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> conferences, 
              graphic arts conferences, library conferences, and so on. Yet, every 
              conference I attend reads like a computer conference, because they 
              are so heavily engaged in computer technology. The level of computer 
              technology used in any of a great <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of fields is quite impressive. 
            </p>
<p><b><i>Question 11:&#160; How do you envision the world in 2015?&#160; 
              What economic and technological predictions would you make for that 
              year?</i></b></p>
<p>By 2015, computers will be largely invisible, and will be very 
              small. We will be dealing with a mesh of computing and communications 
              that will be embedded in the environment and in our clothing. People 
              in 2005 face a dilemma because, on the one hand, they want large, 
              high-resolution displays. They can obtain these displays by buying 
              expensive 72&#8221; flat-panel plasma monitors. But they also want portable 
              devices, which have limited display capabilities.&#160; By 2015, 
              we will have images input directly onto our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s. This allows 
              for a very high-resolution display that encompasses the entire visual 
              field of view yet is physically tiny. These devices exist in 2005, 
              and are used in high-performance applications, such as putting a 
              soldier or a surgeon into a virtual reality environment. So in 2015, 
              if we want a large, high-resolution computer image, it will just 
              appear virtually in the air. We will have augmented <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, including 
              pop-up displays explaining what is happening in the real world. 
              We will be able to go into full-immersion, visual auditory virtual 
              reality environments.</p>
<p>We will have useable language technologies. These are beginning 
              to emerge, and by 2015 they will be quite effective. In this visual 
              field of view, we will have virtual personalities with which you 
              can interact. Computers will have virtual assistants with sufficient 
              command of speech recognition that you can discuss subjects with 
              them. Search engines won&#8217;t wait to be asked&#8212;they will track 
              your <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> and attempt to anticipate your needs and help 
              you with routine transactions. These virtual assistants won&#8217;t be 
              at the human level, that won&#8217;t happen until we have strong AI.&#160;But 
              they will be useful, and many transactions will be mediated by these 
              assistants. Computing will be very powerful, and it will be a mesh 
              of computing. Individuals who need the power of a million computers 
              for 25 milliseconds will be able to obtain that as needed.</p>
<p>By 2015, we will have real traction with nanotechnology. I believe 
              that we will be well on the way to overcoming major <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s, such 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, heart disease, and diabetes through the biotechnology 
              revolution that we talked above. We will also make progress in <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              how to stop and even reverse the  aging process.</p>

<br>
<br>
Ray Kurzweil does a great job of _describing_ the future, while some of us true-blue wackos are out here trying to make it happen:
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614001526/http://visitware.com/AI4U/PODsales.html#oct2005" target="_blank">http://visitware.com/AI4U/PODsales.html#oct2005</a> -- my print-on-demand AI4U book sells far fewer copies than any single book by Ray Kurzweil; way to go, Ray.

All around the world, Netizens search for "AI algorithms" and arrive at my "AI Steps" webpage, so now I am beefing it up, big time. The most recent innovation is to focus on Evo Recap -- the recapitulation of the evolution of mind. As a consequence, websurfers are lingering for up to an hour and looking at thirty-plus subordinate pages. And so, wake up, high-tech America -- if you snub your nose at Mentifex AI, there are lots of hungrier-than-thou but just as smart-as-thou would-be AI coders and Singularity entrepreneurs in India, in China, in Singapore, in Japan, in 
<br>
South America -- and many of them are aware of the Mentifex offerings in open-source AI. In South America, beaucoup websites carry Spanish-language translations of the Mentifex AI theory documents. They don't know that Mentifex is just another crank.
<br>

It is not easy to understand, so I have proceeded from the most general overview down into the various branches of deeply detailed implementation. Now, all you lazy Americans -- don't bother trying to grok this stuff and risking a headache. Let some funny-clothed foreigner, whom you have not yet killed to steal his oil, spring an AI surprise on you by Christmas 2006.

I'd like to know if this also means that "ordinary" poverty the one that makes people work at least 40 hours per week for a low salary and in conditions you can't choose will also be erradicate.

In other words if technology will make us somehow financially free so we don't have to put up with bosses and workmates any more.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>In response to the person who asked whether common man will be financially independent, the answer is absolutely not.  People like me derive pleasure from exploiting our less financially educated peers.  People like me not only control the money, they control that which gives money its value: labor.  
<br>
<br>
Although quality of life will improve for everybody as technology improves (a rising tide lifts all ships) people will still have to work menial jobs in the services industry.  Do you think people will start changing their own oil, cooking their own meals, and driving to china to get clothes, shoes, and other textiles all of a sudden?  Maybe we'll all build our own houses too so nobody has to work 40 hours a week.
<br>
<br>
An interesting example is the automated checkout lanes at Walmart.  That has been a merchant's dream since trade began.  So now instead of paying four people to have four checkout lanes, they pay one who supervises four lanes.  The other three are dismissed to go compete for fewer and fewer menial jobs in the services and infrastructure industries.  Most of the reward for this and every other technological innovation goes to the owners!  Any guesses about what the owners do with the spoils?  They use it to make people do what can't yet be done with machines.  When you read that the average american family is deeply in debt, now you know what that debt means: an obligation to do for the owners what can't be done with machines.  
<br>
<br>
The most beautiful part is that average people fall further and further into debt (at technology's accelerating rate) simply because there is less that they can do to work it off, and compound interest works both ways.  There are ways to erase debt, but don't count on a country-wide common man bankruptcy any time soon because there will always be something that having a peon around for is a good idea.
<br>
<br>
This is no "apocalyptic future" horror story, it has been happening since man first evolved.  All I'm saying is that it will keep happening and there's nothing wrong with that.  If you want out of the 40 hour a week grind, then do what everybody else did who got out: exploit the system.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I applaud your view of the way real life works. I too have turned away from the idea that the technological singularity will equal a new utopia, where everyone is happy. In actual fact, change is coming and for some it will prove beneficial, for others it will prove disasterous.
<br>
<br>
As for your comment on WalMart and its automated checkout lines depleting the number of payed empolyees, I wonder how long it will be before the person paid to supervise them is out of a job? This is Hans Moravec's vision of the future, in which he imagines the job market to be like a landscape, with valleys representing the jobs in which machines could perform better than people right from the off, to mountain peaks representing jobs that people are much better suited than machines.
<br>
<br>
In his vision, the landscape is being flooded, the water being a metaphore for machine intelligence, inexorably filling the landscape of the job's market, and forcing the human populace to scramble for higher ground..IF they have the wherewithall to reach the peaks and enjoy a respite before the flood claims even the mountain tops.
<br>
<br>
It doesn't necessarily have to be new orders of intelligence that forces a scramble for new jobs. For instance, I understand that Sony are soon to bring out the Reader, which you can think of as being to books what Ipod is to music. Once I have this device, I will not need to buy books from my local store, I can download what I want from the Internet. I can do that with Amazon right now but I wouldn't be surprised if humans are in the loop in this case, unless automation has reached a stage where it can control every single step in the process of taking my money and delivering my book. I imagine downloading a book straight from my computer is easier to automate than the old method...
<br>
<br>
What's next for the chop in the media industry? Well, since I can remember kids have supplimented their pocket money with a paper-round. But once Sony's electronic books become equipped with wireless technology, once wireless Internet is pervasive enough...your morning paper will update itself and you will have no need to buy a new issue each morning, discarding the old. Less rubbish for our landfills, which is good. No more paper rounds which is....? And once we manage to make ALL physical objects downloadable thanks to desktop molecular manufacturing, well, I think the world of work will change forever.
<br>
<br>
At this point I would recommend Damien Broderick's book 'The Spike', which has a chapter dealing with the way our working lives may be affected if the technological wave continues to gather strength. Here is a quote from that very book, which I'm sure jontait would agree with:
<br>
<br>
'It's a truism that consumer capitalism has to run hard and fast to sustain adequate demand for the relentless cascade of goods pouring from our factories. The pressure of this glut calls forth the huge, sophisticated machinery of the advertising industry, millions spent to persuade us to consume with lusty and extravagant zeal, and to go into debt in doing so'.</p></td>

This increase in the availability did not happen in a flash, but it did happen very quickly nonetheless. It's almost cliche to comment that the Internet exploded into everyday life seemingly overnight..

<br>
Once MM finally hits its stride, I would definitely expect people to obtain clothes, textiles, food, etc etc in a way that drastically reduces the reason to drive a car to some WalMart.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The revelation/prediction that we shall become more than what we may presume, at this time, is almost refreshing to consider. It is a tantalizing temptation, to argue the points that Ray Kurzweil makes in this interview. This becomes more difficult, however, as I find myself in agreement with many of his suppositions. Difficult, too, is the task of envisioning/imagining/describing what the end result of all this Singularity/nanotechnology stuff will look like. The exponential nature of the human development that Mr. Kurzweil envisions hints at incredible, individual enpowerment. What appears truly of concern is what possible effects may occur to the human psyche. Alvin Toffler, opined about the effect of rapid societal alterations on the the mental health of the people. Will we see even more boggling of brains as the Singularity approaches?
<br>
     If there were any area which I could find to counterpoint you, Ray Kurzweil, I would have to wonder about the feasibility question. Does increased, even exhorbitantly increased, computing capacity necessarily tanslate to actual/practical intelligence. Can autonomously actuating  devices actually be developed? Shall we see endless rows of ramchips and microprocessors spontaneously become galaxy spanning, Matrioshka Minds. Or aren't we better served in closely monitoring the social pathology of the big-brains who are stringing these complex systems together. Science for it's own sake is a wonderful pursuit. Does it pay to sacrifice the well-being of general society at the other end of the spectrum?
<br>
     In closing I pose a question to other Mind-X posters: What elements/systems of present day science/technology/social structure, support/indicate the possibility/inevatibility of future Singularity scenarios? The reason why I ask is; I am wondering what the best precautions/preparations would be for the implimentation of ones own, Singularity operation. Also, it would be nice to prepare the frail human body for the onslaught of superintelligent/stong progeny to come.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is not entirely accurate to portray Ray Kurzweil as the guy who thinks 'increased computation translates to actual/practical intelligence'. He has repeatedly stated that 'increases in hardware performance is a necessary but INSUFFICIENT step toward true artificial intelligence'. Moreover, his law of accelerating returns shows that evolution results in BETTER answers, not necessarily more complicated ones. It is quite possible for a superior solution to be a simpler one.
<br>
<br>
As to the question posed to Mind-Xers, well Kurzweil's version of the Singularity is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that if something is working in natural systems, it can be reverse engineered by technology. Thus, because natural systems already use molecular manufacturing and have built human-level intelligence, both these goals must be obtainable through technology.
<br>
<br>
The second assumption is that nature is inherently sub-optimal, 'creating' 'tools' that are just good enough to help natural systems get by. On the other hand, technology only ceases to improve itself once it rams up against the physical limits of set by the laws governing the Universe. Thus, once technology has evolved the ability to use molecular manufacturing and human-levels of intelligence, it will soar past the capabilities of sub-optimal nature.
<br>
<br>
It is important to understand that we are advancing toward this future as a result of thousands of tiny steps, each one of which is quite conservative and is merely the next generation of products already available. Moreover, we are approaching these goals from such a variety of positions that even if one appraoch should fail to yield fruit, there are many more approaches still chipping away at the problem.
<br>
<br>
I have written about this more extensivley in the Mind X thread called 'cummulative and convergent knowledge'.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I appreciate your reply, Extropia and must agree with you. It is indeed quite elegent and compelling to see a simple solution that uniquely solves a given equation. Right off hand, I would likely present the creation of the graphical user interface to computers as an example of such. It made possible for millions of individuals to avail themselves of the power of computers. Mr.Kurzweils inventions, particularly the Reader for the blind are also good examples.
<br>
     I agree, as well, that it is, likely possible to model occurence and presupposition, such that we can see realized this wondrous, Singularity. If we can presume that our methods include structured, directed attrition, the small victories method, then we can, certainly anticipate, eventually, a complete project. I can't help but wonder what this completed puzzle will look like.
<br>
     Therefore, I would like to propose one other question to Mind-Xers. What will the Completed Structure of Singularity appear as? Are we to far back of the Event that we cannot imagine the landscape that shall, surely, be presented to our eyes and those of our children. Provided that we still have necessity for those organs, or any others? What will we become? What shall we eventually see?
<br>
     Finally, can we see some hints, some clues along the way? Can we experience some examples of what exists that may preclude these developements? I know that the US Army is working with creating personal armor, from smart-nanotechy type materials. Also, the computer industry  is reaching deep, into the submicron, nanolevel for it's increased facility. I hope that all intentions are good:) I haven't even been following the progress that NASA Ames has been making. I'm sure there work in preflight preparation of the individual is garnering some startling results. Not to mention the medical/biotechnological areas. The list goes on and on. These are exciting times.</p></td>
