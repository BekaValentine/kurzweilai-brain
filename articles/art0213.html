<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and intranets to evolve into a highly productive environment for <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and business, we must develop a new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of technologies. In the first <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a>, the primary problem has been connectivity and <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">Hardware</a>, such as fibers and <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, such as protocols and caching, comprise the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>'s core technologies today.</p>
<p>These technologies provide as many bits as possible, as fast as possible. Even as we solve connectivity problems, however, a new challenge already faces <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> users: How do you find and manage the vast amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on local file <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s or the Web? The second <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> will include technologies for <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing, indexing, and organizing huge amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to support decision making, <a class="thought" href="entries/ecommerce_entry.html">e-commerce</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. These technologies must "understand" documents, images, and movies, as well as more structured objects such as spreadsheets, parts catalogs, GIS layers, libraries of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, genetic sequences, and so on.</p>
<p>The understanding doesn't need to be complete, just sufficient to do the job. However, the understanding must be able to adapt to the Web's rapidly changing structure and the user's evolving needs. I believe a rapidly evolving new <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of techniques, based on a new area of applied <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> called statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, will be a key <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of this second <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a>. You can apply these methods to develop classifiers that extract <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> items, such as paragraphs in documents or desired parts of images and videos, by assigning them to meaningful classes. You can also use these methods to extract <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>--including relationships between <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> items.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, you might be able to use these technologies to automate document catalogs maintenance, such as those currently developed manually by Yahoo! and other Web <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s. You could also apply them to sort e-mail into relevant categories, identify junk mail, and route documents automatically to the appropriate people--even provide automatic answers. Unlike existing text-based <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-retrieval methods, you can apply these methods equally well to text, images, and visual and audio recordings, as well as to numerical and scientific-<a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> objects such as genetic sequence <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, galactic spectra, and so on. Finally, you can customize these <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> methods by fast training and execute them continually in the rapidly changing Web.</p>
<p>A few <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists from the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> community are beginning to develop techniques to manage, organize, and <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for multimedia <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> by harnessing the new statistical <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> theories and <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s. For instance, a small consortium of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers at MIT and in Oregon and Illinois expect to develop prototype <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to classify and route e-mail messages and to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>, categorize, and extract <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on the Web.</p>
<p>Consider a typical, small-scale problem this <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> project will tackle. The MIT Admissions Office typically receives 500 e-mail messages per day that are answered by two full-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> employees. Imagine a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that could automatically classify e-mail messages according to an evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of categories. Many of these messages contain standard questions: The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could automatically answer those messages with canned text, and route others to specific people automatically. As admissions policies, personnel, and course requirements change, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> would adapt its classifications with a modest amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> interaction.</p>
<p>Commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s with primitive capabilities of this type are becoming available, but we need to develop technologies to improve their limited performance. Consider a second, rather obvious example. Commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s for the Web continue to improve, but they can't answer many types of complex, multimedia queries. A skilled <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> can answer many types of queries existing <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s can't. For example, consider these requests: (a) show pictures of students currently supervised by Professor Tom Dietterich; (b) retrieve images of portable telephones manufactured by Motorola in 1998. You can answer the first <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a> by finding Dietterich's home page, tracing links from that page to the home pages of his students, and analyzing images on those pages to determine whether they're images of the student, as opposed to images of his or her spouse and children. You could answer the second <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing Web pages or catalogs at Motorola, or online magazine articles for old product reviews.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these kinds of queries are becoming more common, and we need to create automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to answer them. It's clear that developing smarter classification <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for multimedia <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> will play a key role in enabling a second, more intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> technologies. We need automatic techniques to route, organize, and <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to help individuals and organizations exploit the ocean of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s are creating--instead of drowning in it.</p>
