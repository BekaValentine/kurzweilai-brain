<p>Inheritable characteristics are passed from one generation to the next through <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> that is present in all of our cells. Scientists think of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> as being divided into genes, or units of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. In the past three decades, scientists have learned how to mix and match characteristics among unrelated creatures by moving genes from one creature to another. This is called "genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering."</p>
<p>As we saw in our series on genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of food crops, genetic "<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers" are now moving genes around among plants, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> on a regular basis, but with very little understanding of the possible consequences, and almost no safety testing. Now genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers are starting to modify the genes of humans, using three approaches: 1) cloning, 2) <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a>, and 3) <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="#">germline manipulation</a>.</p>
<p>Cloning: Cloning uses the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> of an existing individual to create a new individual. The best-known example is Dolly, a sheep that was cloned using <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from a sheep that had been dead for six years. A <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> has not yet been cloned, but a team of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers including an American and an Italian recently announced they are going to attempt it.[1]</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">Somatic cell manipulation</a>: <a class="thought" href="#">Somatic cell</a>s are all the cells of the body that do not pass <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> on to the next generation. <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">Somatic cell manipulation</a> is currently practiced in some medical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> centers under the name "gene therapy." For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers are experimenting with ways to introduce genes into the blood cells of patients with hemophilia (a blood disorder), and into cells of the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> in patients with Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID), a rare inherited disorder of the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>. The idea is to "correct" the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of the disease instead of, or in addition to, treating the disease with drugs. Hundreds of trials have been carried out, but in most cases the patients have not been cured.[2]</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="#">Germline manipulation</a>: Germ cells (sperm and eggs) do pass <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> from one generation to the next. <a class="thought" href="#">Germline manipulation</a> refers to changes in the germ cells changes which will be inherited by successive generations. Designing <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations through <a class="thought" href="#">germline manipulation</a> is still in the realm of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, but just barely: some influential scientists are arguing that it should be attempted.</p>
<p>Why are scientists pursuing these techniques? Some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers see <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a> as a promising way to treat serious diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. Other genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers may have less idealistic motives. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells is technically appealing, and the mere fact that we possess this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is, for some people, sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to use it. Some technological optimists are fascinated by the idea of germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering as a way to "take <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> into our own hands" by redesigning the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in our children's cells.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells could also be a big money-maker. For example, one company hopes to create a market in "organ repair" generating cloned cells and tissues to insert into existing people's organs.[3, pg. 18] Other companies and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers simply want to keep open the option to <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells because it could be profitable in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, even if they have not made investments in doing it right now.[3]</p><h1>Cloning</h1><p>There are two main applications of cloning. One is "<a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> cloning," which could be used to create new <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> parts. For example, some scientists are working on methods to produce a new <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> from an existing person's cells and then use the cells from that <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> to produce replacements for failing body parts in the original person.[4] An <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> develops about a week after conception, and in its early stages consists of a few identical cells.</p>
<p>"Reproductive cloning" would produce complete cloned individuals, like Dolly the sheep. Genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers are now able to <a class="thought" href="entries/clone_entry.html">clone</a> mice and cattle as well as sheep.[5, pg. 45] <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> cloning would produce a new person who is a near genetic copy of another person. He or she would, however, be different from the original person because he or she would develop in a different environment and have different experiences.</p>
<p>Many people think both "reproductive cloning" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> cloning" are repugnant and unethical. Other people think <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> cloning could be acceptable in some cases to treat disease but think reproductive cloning is wholly unnecessary and never justifiable.</p>
<p>In the U.S., federal funds cannot be used for reproductive cloning experiments and some states have outlawed it, but there is no federal law against it.[5, pg. 4] A team of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers recently announced they are going to attempt <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cloning in an "unidentified Mediterranean country."[1] These <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have been widely condemned, but some of their colleagues are primarily concerned that this early attempt at cloning could give the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> a bad name and reduce the public's willingness to allow further cloning <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">Somatic cell manipulation</a></h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">Somatic cell manipulation</a> adds genes to existing cells in some part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, such as the lungs or the blood. <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">Somatic cell manipulation</a> is only supposed to affect the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> of the person undergoing the treatment. In theory, it does not produce changes that could be passed on to that person's children and grandchildren.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">Somatic cell manipulation</a> was first attempted on humans in 1990.[6, pg. 110] The mechanisms of <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a> are poorly understood, and the effects can be lethal. In one case, a teenager died after <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers at the University of Pennsylvania tried to introduce genes into his liver cells, using a modified <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> to carry the genes to their destination. The idea was that the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> would "infect" the target cells and insert the desired genes, without being dangerous itself. The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers are still not certain how they killed their patient, but evidence suggests the <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> invaded many organs besides the liver and triggered a severe immune reaction.[7]</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a> also poses the threat of insertional mutagenesis, in which inserting new <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> changes or disrupts the functioning of existing <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. (See REHN #716.) FDA also says <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers attempting to alter <a class="thought" href="#">somatic cell</a>s could inadvertently introduce foreign genes into the patient's sperm or egg cells.[8, pg. 4689] If this happened, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers could accidentally change the genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> passed from parent to child.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers are required to submit <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to FDA and the National Institutes of Health (<a class="thought" href="entries/nih_entry.html">NIH</a>) on any adverse effects that occur during <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a> trials. After the teenager's <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, an investigation revealed that many <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers were not reporting adverse effects to <a class="thought" href="entries/nih_entry.html">NIH</a>, which can make the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> public. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers say it would "confuse people" to report every <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> that occurs during these trials because many participants are seriously ill and could die for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s unrelated to the treatment.[9]</p>
<p>Right now, most <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers submit to FDA on <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a> experiments is kept secret.[8, pg. 4688] The agency has issued proposed regulations under which <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/scm_entry.html">somatic cell manipulation</a> trials will be made available to the public, and is accepting comments on the proposed regulations until April 18, 2001.[10]</p><h1><a class="thought" href="#">Germline manipulation</a></h1><p><a class="thought" href="#">Germline manipulation</a> permanently changes the inheritable characteristics passed from one generation to the next. This can be done by altering sperm or egg cells or by altering an <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>. If an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> survives and develops into a baby, the changes introduced by <a class="thought" href="#">germline manipulation</a> will be present in every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> of that baby. If the baby survives to adulthood and has children, the changes will be passed on to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations, through that person's sperm or egg cells.</p>
<p>Some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers try to justify <a class="thought" href="#">germline manipulation</a> by saying it could remove or replace <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> associated with an inherited disease. This is a far-fetched idea and unnecessary; even if both members of a couple have the genes for a hereditary disease, there are other ways to produce a child without the disease, including using donated sperm or eggs.</p>
<p>Other <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers say they want to use germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering to give a baby new genetic features it could not have gotten from its parents. This goal cannot be achieved through any other <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. It is also a goal that, by definition, could never be medically necessary because it would not serve to relieve sickness in an existing person. Instead, it would aim to "improve" <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings.[6, pg. 113]</p>
<p>The attempt to "improve" the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race genetically--as one might create a specialized breed of horses or dogs--is known as eugenics. In the early decades of the 20th century, eugenics projects in the U.S. led to forced sterilization of some people who were considered to have undesirable traits. This included prison inmates who were considered to be "hereditary criminals." One forced sterilization was justified by describing a man as "subnormal mentally," with "every appearance and indication of immorality."[6, pgs. 20-21] In Nazi Germany, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic extermination of Jews and other people was one part of a eugenic project to breed a "superior race."[6, pg. 17]</p>
<p>Some prominent scientists hope to achieve eugenic goals through genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering instead of through breeding. Molecular biologist Daniel Koshland, formerly the editor of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">SCIENCE</a> magazine, argues that "if a child destined to have a permanently low <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> could be cured by replacing a gene, would anyone really argue against that?" He continues, "It is a short step from that decision to improving a normal <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a>. Is there an argument against making superior individuals?... As society gets more complex, perhaps it must select for individuals more capable of coping with its complex problems."[4, pgs. 115-116]</p><h1>To be continued...</h1><a name="r1"></a>

What happens to people who can't afford it? Are they just left behind as "inferior races"? Billions of people in world's most populous countries like China and India can't even afford to eat two meals per day. When the world is going to be dominated by the "superior race" created by germline manipulation it would force these poor people to extinction, i.e. lot of people will die as they wouldn't be able to compete for basic human needs. Is that something we really want? </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I understand that human engineering can bring many wonderful benefits to medical science; curing diseases, recovering organs - those are truly noble goals, thanks to which our lives may be improved and prolonged. But I am rather concerned regarding the artificial alteration of human intelligence. Aren't we crossing the line there?
<br>
<br>
Daniel Koshland poses the question: "Is there an argument against making superior individuals?" I am afraid there is. 
<br>
<br>
First of all, what is meant by the term 'superior individuals'? From a scientific point of view it means people with increased IQ, i.e. people who can learn and think faster, have better memory and are able to complete more complex tasks. But has someone considered the difference between 'intelligence' and 'wisdom'? Is our society wise enough to handle increased intelligence? What if these 'superior' individuals shall take advantage of their high intelligence and use it against humanity? Who would be able to stop them? 
<br>
<br>
Second of all, let us consider the research that would have to be conducted in order to properly test all the consequences of human engineering. Who can ever determine how long of a research is necessary to make sure there will be no negative side effects? What if by altering human intelligence we also modify other parts of human behavior, for example emotions? What if the 'superior' individuals will develop aggressive deviances that would endanger other people? What if the extent to which they will be able to feel and express love and compassion should be limited?  
<br>
It is important to realize that every human is original; the DNA differs from person to person. Therefore I am afraid that it is impossible to ever be hundred percent sure of the possible consequences. It is the future of humankind that is at stake; should we take such risks?
<br>
<br>
Next, there is the issue of inequality, as already noted in the previous reply by luvpreet. We have to take into account that the creation of 'superior' race would also introduce possibly a wide gap between naturally born and artificially 'improved' individuals. Who would prosper in such a world? For those familiar with Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest it is not hard to take an educated guess. People who would not be able to level with the new, more intelligent race, would have a lesser chance to get a good employment, thus to survive in our money-driven society. 
<br>
Parents would never want their children to be disadvantaged and that would lead to a wide spread of "improved" people. But what if someone will ask for more? Since it is possible to make someone "smart", what should prevent us to make him/her even "smarter"? There is a danger that a mad competition would follow which might then get out of control.  
<br>
<br>
Daniel Koshland argues that: "As society gets more complex, perhaps it must select for individuals more capable of coping with its complex problems." But this is happening naturally. It is true that society is constantly developing, but so is the intelligence of people. We are already handling much more complex tasks then people used to in the past. And maybe our speed and memory is limited, but thanks to computer science we have a vast amount of tools to assist us in that. 
<br>
<br>
Besides, I believe that if we want to achieve higher intelligence, we should first try to do so naturally, i.e. through education. I am quite certain that there is plenty room for improvement, shouldn't we first invest there? Right now, there are many intelligent people out there, who, due to lack of education or as a result of bad education, do not stand a chance in today's society. 
<br>
<br>
I understand that the challenge of "improving" human intelligence might be very tempting to scientists, and it is fascinating to hypothesize upon the idea, but I think that to actually carry it out represents too much of a danger to society.

<br>
<br>
All very excellent questions.  I have long had the same concerns.
<br>
<br>
Surely, it is one thing for an "adult" to voluntarily augment (or tinker) with their abilities.  But the moral issues with creating "altered children" are almost unfathomable.
<br>
<br>
Of course, as you mention, we do this "naturally" today.  We educate, we "innoculate", and (some believe) that a fetus exposed to classical music in the womb during development is born with enhanced intelligence, perhaps by the varied stimulation of neural development.
<br>
<br>
The problem (as I see it) is the lack of a clear "line" to be crossed.
<br>
<br>
Somewhere, a genetic therapy will be demonstrated to reduce the risk of heart disease, or some more terrible disorder, and it will "just happen" to coincide with enhanced intelligence.  Parents will demand to have the therapy applied for the (stated) former reason, while actually hoping for the latter.
<br>
<br>
The boundary is not distinct.  Trouble ahead.
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hana,
<br>
<br>
I totally agree with you.  It is very easy to see the picture in our current society, and using that as a basis the future of genetic engineering is just a magnified version of our current society.  IQ is a very good example to use, though the situation does not apply only to IQ measures.  Since the discussion has been on IQ, I will stick to that.
<br>
I have seen 'bright' students getting hired before they graduate from university and their starting salary has 6 digits.  This is analogous to high IQ (I used analogous because it might not be the case).  I have seen students that cannot even graduate, not because of their laziness, but due to working extremely hard but still cannot get a passing grade.  This is analogous to low IQ.  From education to society, where will these two extremes end up?  The 'high IQ' will have a better chance of selecting a job and living a life that he wants.  The 'low IQ' will have less choice in selecting jobs.  And I am talking about people in one country for now.  This gap is already a big one within one country.  Let us leave out the fact that the top 'high IQ' in developed countries and the 'low IQ' in third world countries and be quite a wide gap.
<br>
This gap is growing even without genetic engineering, but at an acceptable (or not) rate.  Now let us introduce genetic engineering.  The whole situation now has nothing to do with whether you are fortunate (to have higher IQ) or not, but whether you can afford it or not.  Taking the previous scenario for example.  This 'high IQ' person has some spare cash and can say, 'oh I'm smart, but I want my kids to be smarter.'  The scary part is they can actually do that.  Of course the 'low IQ' individual will want their kids to be smarter as well, but he might not be able to afford it.  See the rate of gap widening changing here?  
<br>
How does the widening of this gap affect our society?  Different classes of human will appear, lower classes will be dominated by high classes because they have to survive but they don't have the ability to, so they have to reply on people that have the ability (sounds like the Middle Ages?), and possibly extinction of the lower classes.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>With regards to the points made by Hana, I agree that to allow the creation of 'superior' individuals we would not only bring about a great gap in IQ inequality, but also a fierce competition of IQ level down each generation.  By genetically enhancing IQ's of particular individuals we widen the gap that already exists between the bourgeois and the proletarians.  The bourgeois having the benefit of more monetary funds will be able to 'upgrade' their children's IQ whilst the proletarians whom cannot afford such endeavors will not be able to, thus creating an imbalance on the class scale.  Children of the bourgeois would then always be a level above the proletarians causing a freeze in the social class status where the smart and wealthy will always remain as such whilst the poor and normal proletarians would remain in at 
<br>
their current status forever.  
<br>
<br>
Continuing upon the point just mentioned we could look at this through a socialists point a view and ask who is to say who should maintain the status quo?  According to Koshland, society should appoint superior individuals who are more intelligent to handle the ever increasing complexity of societal advancement in technology.  Yet there is very much a flaw in the matter since the question comes to who are the individuals who select the people to handle the complex problems of society?  The same argument can be applied to gene manipulation.  Who is to choose what is considered as good genes?  Who is to define what intelligence is?  With the manipulation of genes, the probability of losing the diversity of people is high since with selection comes biases.  Take for example the case of a class of computer science students.  All the students in the class are struggling to pass the course, some doing better than others, some barely surviving.  Should the professor begin to select whom he/she wishes to pass without an objective method, i.e. according to personality, great minds could be lost.
<br>
<br>
Diversity of people, however, may not be only thing at risk.  Since we are biased in our selection we don't really know if the genes that we dub as 'good' will remain good in the long run if we continue to reinforce that 'good' gene.  The abilities and intelligence of people are made up of a combination of genes as a whole.  When we tinker with what we think is considered good and remove what we think is bad, we come to the possibility of actually causing devolution.  
<br>
<br>
Bias and selection also causes the problem of loss of other gene traits when undergoing gene manipulation.  It is through natural selection and evolution that humans have become what we are today.  If manipulation were done by a select biased individuals who believe they know what the 'best' genes are, in the long run, dire consequences may arise.  People are ever changing organisms and trends and demands are occurring each and every day as technology advances.  Should a day arise where there is a high demand for people who are very good with algorithms, a gene manipulation for that particular trait may be enhanced.  At one point however, there may be a turn about and demands for that particular trait is dropped and in the case for all the people who have that particular trait as their only strong point, they would not be able to survive in society.    
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, we can see that playing god with human genes is a serious issue.  It is my belief that we are not ready to deal with this just yet.  Human engineering should not take place especially when we do not know the big picture of the human genome nor the consequences for any modifications on it in the long run.  I think of it as trying to modify a program code when you don't really know how everything interacts.  So when you finish adding modified code to it, it may run for a while, but in the end, it may cause a system crash.    </p></td>

It is easy to say now that we should hold off with any experimentation in this area, but, once the choice is available, it will become irresistable to many.

It is also likely that the cost of the genetic manipulation will come down rapidly as our understanding progresses.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Genetic engineering is definitely a very unpredictable field of study and the consequences of some of the research taking place today can be very difficult to digest.  However, what people fear most is taking responsibility for their own evolution.  And rightly so because the potential power that this technology proposes to offer us is unimaginable.  Just as unimaginable and scary as it would have been for people who had lived during the early years of the industrial revolution and the technological revolution.  
<br>
This fear that we have for the unknown has been with us for a very long time.  For a while, we were able to keep this fear at bay by using God as an explanation for things that we did not understand.  Now that we have the potential to play God, we are faced with the situation of having to redefine our notion of God.  This was traumatic for people who had to contend with the realization that the Earth was not the center of the Earth and it poses to be equally traumatic for us.  
<br>
<br>
There is no guarantee that we will survive this trial of fire and even if do, we cannot be sure that we will like the results.  However, we really don't have a choice in the matter.  Countries may publicly prohibit research in this field of study but most certainly will pursue it secrecy.  Those countries who fail to invest in genetic engineering are making themselves vulnerable to those that have genetic engineering technology.  
<br>
<br>
Trying to control this field of study through the use of laws is utterly foolish because discoveries in this area are being made everyday while laws take months if not years to be put in place.  Also, we live in an international world but we try to use national policies to control the research.  People who find that they cannot pursue a line of research in one part the world, can easily find places where their work will be supported.  
<br>
<br>
So instead of forbidding this type of research from taking place, we should encourage more discussion so that everyone can be aware of exactly what is going on.  We should also provide a monitored environment where this research can take place so that we decrease the chances of being caught unawares by the perils of this technology.  To do this, we will need an international organization that can monitor all research taking place and has the power and authority to punish people who use this technology irresponsibly. 
<br>
<br>
Other than that, all we can do is have faith in our own ability to survive.  Who knows, the results may prove to be worth the danger.</p></td>
