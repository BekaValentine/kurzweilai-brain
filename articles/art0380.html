Published on KurzweilAI.net January 21, 2002. Read Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s Edge question <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011223449/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0376.html%20" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<p>Physicists, including several in this group, are fond of asking, "What if the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> had been different?" Are the fundamental constants just numbers we accept as given, but which could have been different? Or is there some deeper rationale, which we shall eventually discover, that renders them unfree to change? Is our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> the way universes have to be? Or is it one of a huge ensemble of universes? Given present company, I would not aspire to this question, fascinating as it is. Mine is its <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> little brother. Is the life that we observe the way life has to be? Or could we imagine other kinds of life? Long the stock in trade of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, I want to move it closer to <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>. Unfortunately the question is one for a chemist -- which I am not. My hope is that chemists will listen, and work on it.</p>
<p>&#160;<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> as we know it is far more uniform than superficially appears. The differences between an elephant and an <a class="thought" href="entries/amoeba_entry.html">amoeba</a> are superficial. Biochemically speaking, we are all playing most of the same tricks. At this level, most of the variation in life is to be found among the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>. We large animals and plants have just specialized in a few of the tricks that bacterial R &amp; D developed in the Precambrian.</p>
<p>&#160;But all living things, <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> included, practise the same fundamental tricks. Using the universal <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> code, the one-dimensional sequence of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> codons specifies the one-dimensional sequence of amino acids in proteins. This determines the proteins' three-dimensional coiling, which specifies their enzymatic activity, and this, in turn specifies almost everything else. So, I'm not talking about whether living things on other planets will look like us, or will have television aerials sticking on their heads. It is easy to predict that heavy planets with high gravitational fields will breed elephants the size of flies (or flies built like elephants); light planets will grow elephant-sized flies with spindly legs. It is easy to predict that, where there is light, there will be eyes. This is not what I am talking about. I want the answer to a more fundamental question.</p>
<p>&#160;My question, which is for chemists, is this. Can you devise a fundamentally different, alternative biochemistry? Given that, as I firmly believe, life all over the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> must have evolved by the differential survival of something corresponding to genes -- self-replicating codes whose <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> influences their own long-term survival -- do they have to be strung along polynucleotides? The genetic code itself almost certainly didn't have to be the one we actually have -- plenty of other codes would have done the job. Ours is a frozen accident which, once crystallized, could not change. But can you think of a completely different kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>, not a polynucleotide at all, perhaps not even organic, which could do the coding? Does it have to be <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> like the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> code, or could some kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> code be accurate and stable enough to mediate <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>? Does it even have to be a one-dimensional code? And is there any other class of molecules that could step into the shoes of proteins?</p>
<p>&#160;Biochemists, please stop focusing exclusively on the way life actually is. Think about how life might have been. Or how life could be on other worlds. Channel your <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> to devising a complete, alternative biochemistry, whose components are radically different from the ones we know, but are at the same time mutually compatible -- participants in a wholly consistent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> which your chemical calculations show could actually work.</p>
<p>&#160;Why should we want this? I wanted to ask the question, "Is there life on other worlds, and how similar is it to the life we know?" But there is no immediate prospect of our receiving direct answers to these questions, and I am pessimistic of our ever doing so. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> has probably arisen more than once, but on islands in space too widely scattered to make a meeting likely. Theoretical calculations may be our best hope, and are certainly our most immediate hope, of at least estimating the probabilities. There's also the point, which hardly needs making on Edge, that to seek the unfamiliar is a good way to illuminate oneself.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I've wondered for a while now why Dawkins and others don't more fully explore the concept of the meme as being a likely source of "life" (self-sustaining, self-replicating code) elsewhere in the universe.
<br>
<br>
Technological memes, or memeplexes, are perhaps only a few decades away from achieving the requirements for being "life" here on earth. 
<br>
<br>
I suspect it is very likely that this process has gone on elsewhere. If so, much of the "life" elsewhere in the universe may already be in the form of self-sustaining technology, not just the relatively crude biochemical replicators that it originaly evolved from.
<br>
<br>
If so, how will we know the difference? Is there really a difference?
