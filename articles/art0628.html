<div class="TeaserText">"If it were up to the Luddites, human life expectancy would still be 37, and
we'd still be dying from bacterial infections," says Ray Kurzweil in this
wide-ranging interview. The anti-technology movement "is fundamentally
misguided, because it fails to appreciate the profound benefits technology
has brought."</div>

              January 11, 2006. Published on KurzweilAI.net January 18, 2006.</i></p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY: </b>How is the new book doing? </p>
<p><b>KURZWEIL:</b> Very well&#8212;it's in its fourth printing, and 
              has been <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> one both in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and in <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> It's an amazing, magisterial piece of work.<br>
</p>
<p><b>KURZWEIL:</b> Thanks, I appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Why don't you talk a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> about the notion 
              of "singularity"? <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">Set</a> the premise for us.<br>
</p>
<p><b>KURZWEIL:</b> Sure. It's actually a complicated premise, but 
              there are several key ideas. First of all, there's the idea that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in general is accelerating rapidly, and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> 
              in particular is doubling its power, as measured in price performance 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, every year. We will see the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              technology multiplied by a factor of a billion in 25 years. If you 
              imagine increasing the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s for the same price, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, as well as our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, and knowledge 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> processes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, by a factor of a billion 
              in 25 years, it's quite a formidable result.</p>
<p>The second observation is that information technology is not just 
              computerized <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s like <a class="thought" href="entries/mp3_entry.html">MP3</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones, but is something 
              that is deeply influencing every aspect of our lives, including 
              our biology, our knowledge of intelligence, worldwide communications, 
              and so on. People say, well, exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ions can't go on 
              forever: like rabbits in Australia they eat up the foliage and then 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> stops. But what we see actually in these 
              information technologies is that the exponential growth associated 
              with a specific <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> (like, for example, shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s 
              on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>, which underlies <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>) may come 
              to an end, but that doesn't stop the ongoing exponential progression 
              of information technology&#8212;it just yields to another paradigm.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Example?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> A good example is the fact that the integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> was not the first, but the fifth, paradigm to bring exponential 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> to computers. They were shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s in the 1950s, 
              and that came to an end. They couldn't shrink the vacuum tube and 
              keep the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, but it just led to another paradigm which were 
              transistors. In the book I ask, what are the ultimate limits of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to support computation and communication? Yes, 
              there are limits, but they're not very limiting. One cubic inch 
              of nanotube circuitry would be 100 million times more powerful than 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> brain. So there's going to be plenty of capacity with 
              three-dimensional molecular computing to keep these trends going 
              for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> How will this all play out?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> There are two key aspects to the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>&#8212;the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> sides of emulating human intelligence. We'll 
              have sufficient hardware to recreate human intelligence pretty soon. 
              We'll have it in a <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> by 2010. A thousand dollars of 
              computation will equal the 10,000 trillion calculations per second 
              that I estimate is necessary to emulate the human brain by 2020. 
              The software side will take a little longer. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to achieve 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s of human intelligence, we need to actually reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er 
              the human brain, understand its principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>. And there 
              again, not surprisingly, we see exponential growth where we are 
              doubling the spatial resolution of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning every year, and 
              doubling the information that we're gathering about the brain every 
              year. We're showing that we can turn this <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> into working models 
              and simulations. There's also two dozen regions of the brain, that 
              we have modeled and simulated, including the <a class="thought" href="entries/cerebellum_entry.html">cerebellum</a>&#8212;which 
              is where we do our skill formation and which compromises more than 
              half the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the brain. There's an effective simulation of 
              that.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> And this leads to what?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> I make the case that this exponential progression 
              will lead us to an understanding of human intelligence. And by understanding 
              I mean we will have detailed mathematical models and computer simulations 
              of all of the regions of the brain by the mid 2020s. So by the end 
              of the 2020s we'll be able to fully recreate human intelligence. 
              You may wonder: "OK, what's the big deal with that? We already 
              have human intelligence; in fact, we've got six billion human brains 
              running around, so why do we need more?" One of the answers 
              to that question is that it will be a very powerful combination 
              to combine the subtle and supple powers of human <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> 
              with ways in which <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are already superior. Machines can think 
              more quickly than we can. They're much better at logical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              and much better at remembering things: a $1000 notebook computer 
              can remember billions of things accurately whereas we're hard-pressed 
              to remember a handful of phone numbers. And most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, machines 
              can share their knowledge, their skills, and their insights at <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> 
              speed, which is a million times faster than human <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>.</p>
<p>My second point is that <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> intelligence, once it achieves 
              human levels, will double in power every year, whereas human intelligence&#8212;biological 
              intelligence&#8212;is fixed. We have 10 to the 26th power calculations 
              per second in the human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> today, and that's not going to change, 
              but ultimately the nonbiological side of our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>'s intelligence 
              will become by the 2030s thousands of times more powerful than human 
              intelligence and by the 2040s billions of times more powerful. And 
              that will be a really profound transformation.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Why do you call this profound transformation the 
              "singularity"?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> The "singularity" is a metaphor borrowed 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, really referring to the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_horizon_entry.html">event horizon</a>. We can't easily 
              see beyond the event horizon around the <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a> in physics. And 
              here with regard to this historical singularity, we can't easily 
              see beyond that event horizon, because it's so profoundly transformative. 
              We will literally multiple the intelligence of our civilization 
              by merging with, and supplementing our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> intelligence, 
              with this profoundly more capable nonbiological intelligence by 
              a factor of billions, ultimately trillions. And that will dramatically 
              change the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of human civilization. That in a nutshell is what 
              the singularity is all about.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Somewhere in the book you remark that people have 
              a very hard time understanding exponential growth, isn't that right?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes, that's a very good point, and a very important 
              one: it really underlies the difference between the seemingly radical 
              projections I'm making and people's <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> perspectives of what 
              will happen. People intuitively think that the current pace of change 
              will continue at the current pace, and when I say "people" 
              I'm definitely including sophisticated people, scientists. I had 
              a debate recently with someone who is reverse-engineering the human 
              brain who was engaging in a linear extrapolation. He said, "Well 
              it's going to take me 18 months to finish modeling this one ion 
              channel. And there's five other ion channels, and that's five times 
              18 months. And then there's other details, and this other dendrite 
              has six more ion channels." And he's adding it all up in his 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, and saying "Well, it be 100 years before we finish this 
              project, assuming the project is going to go for the next 100 years 
              at the same pace, with the same tools, with the same supercomputers 
              to do the simulations." And I'd add: without factoring in the 
              radically changing landscape. The fact is that the pace of progress 
              is dramatically increasing.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY: </b>What could you cite as an example of this?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> It took us 15 years to sequence HIV. We sequenced 
              SARS in 31 days. So someone doing the mental <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> in 1990, 
              about how long it would take to do, for example, the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> project 
              also came up with centuries to do the project. But we doubled the 
              amount of genetic data we have been sequencing every year. And that 
              has continued. We are doubling the spatial resolution of brain scanning 
              and so on. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is exponential, not linear, and yet virtually 
              all <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> models used to track future trends are linear. They 
              actually work quite well for one year, two years, maybe three, since 
              linear projection is a very good approximation of an exponential 
              one for a short period of time&#8212;but it's a terrible one for 
              a long period of time. They radically diverge, because exponential 
              growth ultimately becomes explosive. And that is the nature of technological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>A related issue is can we really predict the future? The common 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> is that you cannot. But I maintain that you can reliably 
              predict these features of information technology. If you ask me 
              how much will a MIP of computing cost in 2010, or how much will 
              it cost to sequence a base pair of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> in 2010, or what will the 
              special resolution be of brain scanning in 2014, I can give you 
              a figure, and it's likely to be very accurate. And I say this now, 
              not just looking backwards at this data, but I've been making forward-looking 
              projections like this for 25 years that have proven to be quite 
              accurate, even though they were largely controversial when I made 
              them.</p>
<p>But someone might say: How could that be? How are we able to make 
              reliable predictions about the overall future of these technologies 
              when each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> project is very unpredictable? But we see the 
              same thing in other areas of science. Take thermodynamics. It's 
              impossible to predict the path of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> in the air, 
              because it follows a random unpredictable path, and that's true 
              of all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s. Yet, the overall properties of the gas, 
              made up of all of these unpredictable particles is very predictable 
              according to the <a class="thought" href="entries/laws_of_thermodynamics_entry.html">laws of thermodynamics</a>. And the whole process of 
              technology evolution is similarly a complex dynamic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> where 
              each individual project is unpredictable, but the overall results 
              are very predictable. And that's another observation that is contrary 
              to common belief.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> You see yourself as basically an expert in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              recognition, correct?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes, that's my field of interest. We developed 
              the first omni-font <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">optical character recognition</a> system, and the 
              first <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition 
              system. We're now working on electrocardiogram automatic diagnosis 
              to create a smart undershirt for people with heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and conditions 
              like that. So pattern recognition is my field of expertise.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> And so pattern recognition is the heart of... 
              what? Finish that sentence.</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Pattern recognition is the heart of human intelligence. 
              We're in fact not very good at logical thinking, analytical thinking. 
              Computers are already much better at that than we are&#8212;as is 
              clear if you consider a math <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> like "Mathematica" 
              that's very hard even for professionals and mathematicians to keep 
              up with. And yet people are still better than machines at recognizing 
              patterns. However, machines are getting better, and ultimately machines 
              will be better than humans in all areas of pattern recognition. 
              Of course, at that point, computers will have achieved human levels 
              of intelligence, in the late 2020s. But human pattern recognition, 
              though, is basically hardwired for certain types of patterns. For 
              example, there's actually a region of the brain that recognizes 
              faces, and we're very good at that, because we have a built-in capability. 
              We're very good at recognizing language sounds, and language skill 
              is essentially a pattern recognition capability. Computers can apply 
              pattern recognition principles to other types of patterns that humans 
              are good at, and they're also <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to do the kinds of pattern 
              recognition that humans are not good at. And ultimately, we'll be 
              able to exceed human intelligence.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Expand on the idea by using <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> as an example.</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> In chess, a computer can do the logical thinking 
              of thinking about all of the move and counter-move sequences and 
              think all of the different sequences of moves 12 moves ahead and 
              consider billions of those in a few seconds. Garry Kasparov, the 
              chess master, was asked, "How many board positions can you 
              think of in a second?" He said, "Well, less than one." 
              So how is it that he can actually compete against a machine? It's 
              because of pattern recognition. He looks at the board and just instantly 
              recognizes a pattern. He sees: "This is like the board where 
              grand master So-and-So forgot to protect his trailing pawn two years 
              ago." And he's actually studied 100,000 board positions. That 
              is how humans think, largely by recognizing patterns.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Is there some <a class="thought" href="entries/taxonomy_entry.html">taxonomy</a> of pattern recognition, 
              so that you could, for example, compare the pattern recognition 
              involved in different <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s? For example, you, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, see 
              patterns from the perspective of an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, whereas sports fans 
              will see patterns in football strategies and football games.</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes, that's a typically human observation, and 
              is how we think: we see patterns. A better coach or sports strategist 
              will be able to have greater insights into those patterns, and be 
              able to anticipate the patterns of the opposition, and then think 
              of some way of superseding that. And historians see patterns in 
              events in the world. Pattern recognition is the essence of what 
              intelligence is.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Is pattern recognition, though, a generalizable 
              talent that can be replicated and transferred? You've had an astonishing 
              record as an inventor, and you seem to have started when you were&#8212;what?&#8212;age 
              five or something?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, five was when I fashioned myself an inventor; 
              I decided I was going to be an inventor when I was five, and I never 
              really wavered from that. When other kids were wondering whether 
              they would be, firemen or teachers, I always had this conceit, "Well, 
              I know I'm going to be an inventor," and that never changed.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> I had the same conceit but I never invented anything, 
              so what I'm wondering now is what is the nature of your pattern 
              recognition talent? How do you actually go about inventing things? 
              What's the trick? Because I suspect that if you went into any environment 
              whatsoever, you would invent something for that environment. Is 
              that a fair assumption?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes, well, part of it is a belief in the power 
              of ideas, and a confidence that I can find the ideas to solve a 
              problem, and that these ideas exist. One technique is to just to 
              use one's <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. Imagine that a particular problem has been 
              solved, and imagine what the solution would have to look like. So 
              I'll fantasize that I'm giving a presentation four years from now, 
              and describing the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> to my audience, and then I'll imagine 
              what would I have to be saying, and what characteristics would the 
              invention have to have? And then I work backwards: OK, if it's a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a>, well it would have to somehow pick up the image 
              of the page&#8212;well how would it do that? And you use your imagination 
              to break it down into smaller and smaller problems.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> And this isn't a poetic conceit now? You really 
              do work that way?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes, that is how I work. And I actually have 
              a specific mental technique where I do this at night. I've been 
              doing this for several decades. When I go to sleep I assign myself 
              a problem.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> For example?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> It might be some mathematical problem or some 
              practical issue for an invention or even a business strategy question 
              or an interpersonal problem. But I'll assign myself some problem 
              where there's a solution, and I try not to solve it before I go 
              to sleep but just try to think about what do I know about this? 
              What characteristics would a solution have? And then I go to sleep. 
              Doing this primes my subconscious to think about it. Sigmund Freud 
              said accurately that when we <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, some of the censors in our brain 
              are relaxed, so that you might dream about things that are socially 
              taboo or sexually taboo, because the various censors in our brain 
              that say "You can't think that <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>!" are relaxed. 
              So we think about weird things that we wouldn't allow ourselves 
              to think about during the day.</p>
<p>There are also professional blinders that prevent people from thinking 
              creatively. Mental blocks such as "You can't solve a signal 
              processing problem that way" or "Linguistics is not supposed 
              to be done this way." Those assumptions are also relaxed in 
              your dream state, and so you'll think about new ways of solving 
              problems without being burdened by <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s like that. Another 
              thing that's not working when you're dreaming is your rational faculties 
              to evaluate whether an idea is <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able, and that's why fantastic 
              things will happen in the dream, and the most amazing thing of all 
              is that you don't think these fantastic things are amazing. So, 
              let's say, an elephant walks through the wall, you don't say, "My 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, how did an elephant walk through the wall?" You just say, 
              "OK, an elephant walked through wall, no big deal." So 
              your rational faculties are also not working.</p>
<p>The next step is in the morning, in this half-way state between 
              dreaming and being awake, what I call <a class="thought" href="entries/lucid_dreaming_entry.html">lucid dreaming</a>, I still have 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the dream thoughts. But now I'm sufficiently conscious 
              to also have my rational faculties. And I can evaluate these ideas, 
              these new creative ideas that came to me during the night, and actually 
              see which ones make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. After 15 to 20 minutes, generally, if 
              I stay in that state, I can have keen new insights into whatever 
              the problem was that I assigned myself. And I've come up with many 
              inventions this way. I've come up with solutions to problems. If 
              I have a key decision to make, I'll always go through this process. 
              And I'll then have a real confidence in the decision, as opposed 
              to just trying to guess at the answer. So this is the mental technique 
              I use to try to combine creative thinking with rational thinking.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> What implications might your technique have for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, I do think that for kids (or really for 
              people at any age) the best way to learn something is to try to 
              solve real problems that are meaningful to them. If, for example, 
              you're trying to create a reading machine, then you learn about 
              optics. And you learn about signal processing, and image enhancement 
              techniques and all of these different things that you need to know 
              in order to solve the problem. If you really have a compelling need 
              to solve these problems, you will learn about them. If you're trying 
              to create, let's say, a hip hop song, well you learn about the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> 
              of hip hop, and how it emerged from other forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>. And you 
              learn something about urban culture. So learning things in <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, 
              where you're actually trying to make a contribution yourself, is 
              a very motivating way to learn&#8212;as opposed to just trying to 
              dryly learn facts out of context and without a purpose for learning 
              them.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Since you mention music, a review of "The 
              Singularity is Near" by Kevin Shapiro in the new Commentary 
              magazine makes the observation that "computers can also compose 
              music, but, aside from computer scientists, not many humans enjoy 
              listening to it." Is that a true statement?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, yes and no. Computers, right now, are actually 
              collaborating with people, and very few musicians will create music 
              today without collaborating with machines that are doing sound enhancement, 
              sequencing, mixing intelligent signal processing and so on. But 
              that criticism is in the genre of observations made by commentators 
              who believe that since computers don't have fully human levels of 
              intelligence today, they never will. It's not my position that computers 
              are equal to humans today; the whole point of my book is that they 
              will have that ability in the future. And I make the case that by 
              2029 computers will be fully equal to humans and thereafter surpass 
              them because they'll be able to combine human levels of intelligence 
              with ways in which machines are superior. One machine will be able 
              to have the best human skills at every area, and multiple machines 
              will be able to share knowledge at electronic speeds. And the machines 
              will double their intelligence every year, which is the nature of 
              computer intelligence. I'm not saying that computers can do everything 
              humans can do today. Computers can't pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> today, 
              but I'm predicting that they'll be able to do it in 2029. [The Turing 
              test, conceived by British <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> pioneer Alan 
              Turing, suggests that if a person can not distinguish between a 
              machine and a human simply by the answers they give to the person's 
              questions, then the machine might be considered to be intelligent.&#8212;ed.] 
              So the fact that there are still some things that humans can do 
              that computers can't today is not a criticism of my case.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> One of the many interesting things in your book 
              is your collection of the most frequent criticisms that have been 
              made of your work, and your response to those critics. I'm wondering 
              if, as an exercise in pattern recognition, you can characterize 
              not so much the criticisms but the critics: do you see certain kinds 
              of people having certain kinds of responses to your work?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, that's a good question. I think one common 
              motivation of some people is a misguided but nonetheless earnest 
              attempt to defend the dignity of human intelligence: "It can't 
              be the case that computers could achieve human levels of intelligence, 
              therefore we've got to find some way in which this theory fails." 
              And so: it can't be done because of physics; or it can't be done 
              because of the way microtubules do <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>; or it can't 
              be done because G&#246;del's uncertainty theorem proves that machines 
              can't possibly do what humans can do; or it can't be done for biological 
              reasons. All this frantic <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing is done to find some reason 
              it can't possibly be the case that machines could achieve the majesty 
              of human intelligence. These criticisms are creative ideas drawn 
              from various fields of science and philosophy, but they have this 
              common motivation the ingrained belief that "it can't be so."</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> One of your critics called you a "materialist."</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes, the philosopher <a class="thought" href="entries/searle_entry.html">John Searle</a>. But I make 
              the case that Searle's view is really much more the materialist 
              view than mine. I mean he's saying&#8212;and it's surprising, actually&#8212;that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is just an ordinary biological function like lactation: 
              we don't understand what causes it yet, but we ultimately will find 
              the cause as some <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> biological function. That's actually a <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist 
              materialist perspective. But even if were to take what he's saying 
              to be the case, my answer would be that, once we discover what that 
              is, there's no reason why that can't be replicated in the machine. 
              In fact, Searle acknowledges that a neuron is just a complicated 
              machine; well, if one neuron is a machine, then a set of 100 billion 
              neurons is also a machine.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> So then you're not a materialist. I was a little 
              surprised, however, that none of your critics, suggested that you 
              are a mystic. Are you a mystic?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, it depends what you mean by mystic. I describe 
              myself as a patternist, and believe that if you put matter and energy 
              in just the right pattern you create something that transcends it. 
              Technology is a good example of that: you put together lenses and 
              mechanical parts and some computers and some software in just the 
              right combination and you create a reading machine for the blind. 
              It's something that transcends the semblance of parts you've put 
              together. That is the nature of technology, and it's the nature 
              of the human brain. Biological molecules put in a certain combination 
              create the transcending properties of human intelligence; you put 
              notes and sounds together in just the right combination, and you 
              create a Beethoven symphony or a Beatles song. So patterns have 
              a power that transcends the parts of that pattern.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Isn't <a class="thought" href="entries/transcendence_entry.html">transcendence</a> another way of saying mystical?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, it could be. It is a reasonable use of 
              the word mystical or magical, but it can have other connotations, 
              namely that these ideas are not rooted in science and that I would 
              disagree with. My views have come from a scientific analysis of 
              technology trends: I didn't start with these views and then try 
              to work backwards to justify them, I started by making a practical 
              effort to time my technology projects, because I realized that timing 
              actually is the most important issue in succeeding as an inventor, 
              and so I began to study these technology trends. When I did, I discovered 
              how predictable certain trends are, and I began making accurate 
              predictions based on my models, which can now anticipate 10 years, 
              20 years, 30 years into the future, and come up with fairly dramatic 
              scenarios of what will be feasible.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Have any of your critics caught your attention 
              to the extent that you changed the way you think about some of these 
              things?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> That's a good question. The basic theory I put 
              forth, the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>, has proven out over several 
              decades. I had hundreds of predictions about the 1990s, and the 
              early 2000s, in my first book, which I wrote in the mid 1980s, "The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a>," which were controversial at the 
              time but have proven to have been quite accurate. I've continued 
              to think about the implications of this theory and we've seen how 
              it's applicable to fields like biology, which is something that 
              really wasn't clear 10 years ago. We only had the genome just two 
              years ago. So I think the critics have actually illuminated various 
              issues that need consideration to really think through the implications 
              philosophically or in terms of different aspects of our biology. 
              And so it's caused me to think through and develop the theory in 
              to other realms. But I think my basic theory is correct, and I haven't 
              changed my dates: I've been projecting the end of the 2020s for 
              machines passing the Turing test consistently for a long time.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Someone like H.G. Wells went from science and 
              technology into world government and large social issues and such. 
              Have you attempted to follow his example?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, I am involved with one important aspect, 
              and that is to study the downside to these technologies. I'm not 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">utopian</a>, and my view is not a utopian perspective. I've been articulating

              out in 1999 and from some <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s we had in 1998. I articulated 
              the downsides in that book and in those conversations, and I articulate

              of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> [GNR stands for the <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">Genetics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a> 
              age&#8212;ed.]." It is my view that the answer to the danger 
              is not to relinquish these technologies&#8212;the position advocated 
              by Bill McKibben, a noted environmentalist who brought <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> 
              to our attention. I have a lot of respect for him, but reject his 
              view that we should basically stop technology progress, and say 
              "enough is enough." In fact, his latest book is called 
              "Enough," his position is that technology has been very 
              good and brought us a lot of good things, but that now we have enough, 
              and that continuing technological development is going to create 
              too many dangers. But I'm opposed to that perspective, for two reasons. 
              Number one is that it would deprive humanity of the benefits, which 
              we very much need: I mean we're close to overcoming <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and heart 
              disease, and stopping progress will allow the suffering in the world 
              to continue. But secondly, it wouldn't work in terms of ameliorating 
              the dangers, and would actually make them worse, because it would 
              drive these technologies underground where we would have even less 
              control over them. Responsible scientists would not have access 
              to the tools needed to defend <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> What would a good example of this be?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Software viruses. Here we have a new human-made, 
              self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a> that didn't exist 30 years ago, and the 
              viruses get more and more sophisticated. Yet they have not destroyed 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, they have not destroyed computer <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, and we 
              keep them at pretty much a nuisance level, because we have a technological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> that responds to the danger every time there's some 
              new sophisticated attack with some new <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. The defenses are created 
              and are distributed within a matter of hours. Now if we can do half 
              as well in the area of let's say biological viruses, or self-replicating 
              nanotechnology, we'll be doing well. However, we do need to invest 
              in the defensive technologies. And I've done a lot to advance that 
              idea. I gave testimony to the Congress recently proposing a $100 
              billion program to create a rapid response system for new biological 
              viruses. Some <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of that were in President Bush's $7 billion 
              program that he recently announced. It doesn't go far enough, and 
              is too small a program by order of magnitude, but we do have technologies 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> interference that can actually destroy biological viruses. 
              I proposed a program that would rapidly sequence a new virus, create 
              an RNA interference medication quickly, and gear up manufacturing. 
              Within a week or two, we could respond to any new virus like bird 
              flu, which is a natural virus, or an unnatural virus like a terrorist 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>. We don't have that system in place, but we could put it 
              in place. And I think we should do that.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> What other issues have you been involved in?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> I'm on the Army Science Advisory Group. The Army 
              is actually the institution responsible for combating <a class="thought" href="entries/bioterrorism_entry.html">bioterrorism</a>, 
              and I've been advising them on that. We need to increase our investment 
              in developing the defensive technologies, because the biggest threat 
              we have right now is the specter of a bioengineered biological virus 
              that could be very disruptive. In fact, Bill Joy and I had a joint 
              op-ed piece in the New York Times a few weeks ago, called "Recipe 
              for Destruction," where we both criticized the publication 
              on the Web of the genome of the 1918 flu virus. We pointed out that 
              it's basically a recipe for a weapon of mass destruction. People 
              would not advocate putting the precise design of an <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> bomb on 
              the Web&#8212;which is in fact, illegal&#8212;and we weren't happy 
              when A.Q. Kahn of Pakistan was disseminating just that kind of information. 
              Yet here we have the design of a biological weapon that could be 
              even worse than an atomic bomb.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> You call it a recipe. Is it a simple recipe?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes; in fact it is even easier now to create 
              the 1918 flu from the genome than it would be to create an atomic 
              bomb from its design. If I gave you the precise design for an atomic 
              bomb you still couldn't build one, and even if I gave you plutonium 
              and the precise designs you'd still have a hard time because building 
              an atomic bomb requires some pretty exotic industrial processes. 
              Yet if I gave you the genome of the 1918 flu (and in fact now you 
              have it, it's on the Web, you can <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> it), you can send in 
              a genetic sequence to a mail order house and get it built for you. 
              Now I'm not saying it's completely trivial to create the 1918 flu 
              &#8212;it has eight genes and they have to be organized in just 
              the right way; but it's actually not that hard either. So we criticized 
              the publication of that information. The genome was published to 
              provide the information to scientists who are trying to protect 
              us from bird flu, but the alternative would have been to provide 
              it just to those scientists, with some kind of security provisions, 
              and that is something we do all of the time with dangerous information. 
              So, anyway, I am involved quite heavily in these kinds of issues 
              on the safe use of these very powerful technologies.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Now is it fair to say that in spite of your concern 
              with the downside of many of these issues you remain basically an 
              optimist as far as the technological future is concerned?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Yes. Part of that is just my nature, and I think 
              you have to be an optimist to be an inventor and an <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>&#8212;because 
              if you were aware of all of the obstacles you were going to face 
              you'd probably never start any project. So being optimistic, I think, 
              is actually self-fulfilling: it's not just an idle anticipation 
              of the future. You actually change the future if you're optimistic 
              in a positive way. But also it comes from just looking at the actual 
              history of technology, which has done an astonishing amount of good. 
              Although we've had a hundred wars in the 20th century, wars that 
              killed 180 million people, you can't necessarily blame technology 
              for creating the conflicts, even if they expanded the scale of destruction; 
              nonetheless, despite that, I would say technology has done more 
              good than harm. You know, 99.9 percent of humanity lived terrible 
              lives 200 or 300 years ago, and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> was well-described by Thomas 
              Hobbes as "nasty, brutish, and short." Human life expectancy 
              was only 37 in 1800, and if someone got a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l infection 
              it would plunge that person's whole family into desperation, because 
              there were no social safety nets. Life was extremely difficult, 
              and labor-filled. For example, it took six hours to prepare the 
              evening meal. So we have liberated ourselves to a great extent from 
              these kinds of miseries. Though we still have a lot of suffering 
              in the world, only technology has the scale to solve problems like 
              environmental degradation and <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>. And the trends are very positive 
              in that. We wiped out half of poverty in Asia over the last 10 years. 
              According to the World Bank, at current rates, we'll cut poverty 
              rates by 90 percent in the next 10 years in Asia, and other areas 
              of the world have also made progress. So I am optimistic, even though 
              I am mindful of these downsides.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Do you have any thoughts about <a class="thought" href="entries/globalization_entry.html">globalization</a>, 
              and the anti-globalization resistance movement?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> Well, globalization is a reflection of the fact 
              that the Internet is a worldwide <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> and has nothing to do 
              with national boundaries. A whole economy exists in this virtual 
              world, which is becoming a larger and larger portion of the world 
              economy. The power, and bandwidth, and reach of this virtual world 
              is growing exponentially, so the idea of, let's say, stopping outsourcing 
              is like trying to sweep back the ocean. I think there is a strong 
              anti-technology movement that started with the <a class="thought" href="entries/luddites_entry.html">Luddites</a> in 1800. 
              I think that movement is fundamentally misguided, because it fails 
              to appreciate the profound benefits technology has brought. For 
              example, the anti GMO movement has forced African nations to refuse 
              food aid because the food has been genetically modified&#8212;and 
              golden rice, which can save hundreds of thousands of children from 
              going blind, has been blocked because it involves genetically modified 
              crops. I'm not saying necessarily saying that every GMO [genetically 
              modified <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>&#8212;ed.] is automatically safe, but the idea 
              that every GMO is automatically detrimental to the world is just 
              plain wrong.</p>
<p><b>UBIQUITY:</b> Do you think the new Luddites will ever come to 
              see the light?</p>
<p> <b>KURZWEIL:</b> I think they're going to continue doing what 
              they're doing: trying to stop progress and trying to keep human 
              beings the way they are. But if you ask me what is a human being, 
              I'd say that we are the species that seeks to go beyond our limitations 
              and beyond our boundaries. We didn't stay on the ground. We didn't 
              stay in the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. We didn't stay within the limits of our biology. 
              And I would point out that, if it were up to the Luddites, human 
              life expectancy would still be 37, and we'd still be dying from 
              bacterial infections.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>KURZWEIL: Sure. It's actually a complicated premise, but there are several key ideas. First of all, there's the idea that technology in general is accelerating rapidly, and information technology in particular is doubling its power,...
<br>
<br>
Rapid acceleration of technology is NOT the main point. More important is how much technology conceptually changes the life of people. That era was 80-120 years ago. There is not need to mention how much technology changed lives of people during that epoch.

Jim had great hopes for the future and living far beyond three score and ten, but he and I realized we might not make it to that point where we could cheat death out of a few more years. But having lost Jim doesn't change my mind about the singularity or diminish my will to see an end to death. How ever I do have a question.

<br>
I just finished a book Call Lucian's Place by Belle Smith which raises the question; could you download a self aware computer brain named Fanny into a blank human brain? Thus creating a human/computer.

<br>
No. You will get the "blank human brain" consciousness and mental capabilities, with the memories of "Fanny".
<br>
<br>
If someone rearranged my brain synapses to *exactly* mimic yours, will you then stop seeing the world through your eyes, and start seeing it through mine ?, or will you see the world through both your eyes and mine ?. Probably neither. It will be me, with your memories.
<br>
<br>
It's not the information that counts, it's the vehicle that holds the information that define our unique self-awareness. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>excellent interviews.
<br>
<br>
Ray is just so hard-working, the eternal optomist managing to retain the child-like enthusiasm we normally use.
<br>
<br>
I didn't realise Marvin Minsky was his mentor. Old man minsky was a god to me as i began thinking about invention (I'm really a theory of invention chap; I find actually building things a bit of a awaste of time.for me) and I rue not having been around him.
<br>
<br>
I agree with much of what RK writes and derived many similar views independantly before I'd read him.
<br>
<br>
Pattern recognition is surely a major key in huaman intelligence.
<br>
<br>
I had to accept this only this last year after a lecture in london at Imperial by Igor Aleksander, but i dont see why mechanical intelligence should  store and match equations in pictorial form.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Data can represented is strings with identifiers.
<br>
<br>
eg when you do a simultaneous equation you are solving for the two identifiers 'x' and 'y'.
<br>
<br>
In pattern recognition they are loking for markers..sufficinet points of check on moving images(. hang around the British Machine Vision Association sometimes, which draws world leaders in visual patterns:

&amp; also see Pattern Recognition Society/ies:

<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to know what a good definition of a pettern is?
<br>
<br>
I've asserted that great minds think in relativity of shape (patterns) and tried to show that Newton and Einstein worked in this way.
<br>
<br>
But that's because we are thinking with environmentally evolved and adapted human braions, based on vision.
<br>
<br>
Few think that the other senses are so profoundly important like vision in men.
<br>
<br>
But not all species have it.
<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean of course that blind moles dont have the hardware for visual cortex processing, just that it's been adapted to convert from vibration (sense of touch) to the area of the brain that specialises in vision (pattern storing and reinforment on neural networks):
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613231650/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12169112&amp;dopt=Abstrac" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=  Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12169112&amp;dopt=Abstrac</a>  t
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont think it necessary to build SAI using geometrical shapes though, because machihes are great at doing simple monotonous routines very quickley.
<br>
<br>
Humans specialise in meta systems...meta patterns and human intelligence is premised and seemingly dependant on relativity of shape.
<br>
<br>
<br>
But reducing this can mean data matching.
<br>
<br>
<br>
One way of match8ng two 345 triangles is the human brain way..that shape LOOKS the same and more opf less FITS this pattern here stored on my visual network!
<br>
<br>
Therefore it is the same archetype.
<br>
<br>
Therefore activate THIS triangle impulse.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This of course is able the basis of phobia.
<br>
<br>
eg the famous vienna case of the woman fainting unexplainedly, on analysis demonstrated she was phopbic about red beards.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
visual snesors are data observers.  The world for a platonist is made of data relations.
<br>
<br>
These relations are so vast and SO many, that vision is a shorthand at filtering.
<br>
<br>
When a human sees an object, it activates cathaxix (emotional stimulation) to varying degrees.
<br>
<br>
Our bigest constatnt sactivation gola is sexual.
<br>
<br>
For hetropsexuals when a man see a sexy woman, his brain stimulates impuses because of his goals heirarchy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Main goal..survive..main preference to activate...mating... when you SEE this pattern...activate hardwired  plus learned program and attempt to mate with her.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The same is true for food.
<br>
<br>
Also for avoidance with competitors, predators.spiders i suspect is some DNA from our history when we were very small, but there are diffrent ideas about them including learning phobias.
<br>
<br>
All these are visual/pattern recognitions from masses of mainly background data.
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is quicker to assess the environment using bvision than  other senses :  a snake uses taste, but it hasn't made the senate.
<br>
<br>
A bat radar (a form of sound I guess). A mole vibration etc
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But I conceive SAI as using data-to-goals as arithmetical computer calculations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The beauty of contempoary simple AI systems is that you can control the machine's environment at present.
<br>
<br>
<br>
few have maintained permanant sensors.
<br>
<br>
some robots do see eg MIT labs  &amp; shadow robots co uk
<br>
<br>
and have cameras, microphones, touch pads, and some have smell detections, but few have radar nor taste.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BUT ALL THESE attampts are to emulate human intelligence which is about wireghting and negotiating a human bieng in a data filled environment.
<br>
<br>
<br>
SAI doens't have to do this.
<br>
<br>
If we have a working definition of what Intelligence is...(PROBLEM SOLVING to achieve  goal/s)
<br>
<br>
in computers the it's 
<br>
<br>
I= MS/G
<br>
<br>
Intelligence  = memory storage X speed of processing/ Goals to be solved
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can work in pure data inmachines.
<br>
<br>
I was heavily influenece by Turing's &amp; later Babbage's machines (engima was  a German invention (see also Zuse)  Turing solved partly by the polish underground smuggling one to the UK in world war II...there are hundreds on line you can play with)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Codes were not broken using shapes.
<br>
<br>
they were cracked by maths.artithmetic.
<br>
<br>
The SAI I'm attempting is maths and arthmetic and ignores vision as an idiosyncratic (ie human) ontology.
<br>
<br>
Vision based intelligence is great for negotiating a moving object through a 3 D envirnoment.
<br>
<br>
But if you dont move much..like a tree..you dont need a visision intelligence system...a chemical touch system is better.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I know the great thinkers believe that emulation of the human brain is prereqisite to building SAI but I'm coming at from a diffrent angle.
<br>
<br>
I think goal satisfaction is important for SAI and the fastest way is to utilise what you have (machine speed and vast...still emmerging... memory storage...and access to memory storage)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also the safety of SAI is a real issue and having one running around the environment testing it's experiments eg by pulling human's heads off as we shamfully do with monkey's doesn't grab me as stragically neat.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm trying to figure out the over arching importance of vision in a thnking machine, because some high calibre players are stating it's imperative.
<br>
<br>
I cant see it:)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Visula data is merely one repr4swntation of data arrangement groups.
<br>
<br>
A chair is just a set of data  relationships.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I mean this literally.
<br>
<br>
Although we think of a chair visually...it is onlt data with relationships relating to other data you, the envirnoment.
<br>
<br>
the fact it seems intrinsically visual is to do with our  peculiar brains.
<br>
<br>
Of course it's one truth...visual stuff...and NOT in conflcit with other represntations of the thing itslef....but is it the best, most reduced way of data modelling?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
i doubt it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
the best way for a amchine is going to be machine like.
<br>
<br>
that is binary.
<br>
<br>
And heirarchies of binary data.
<br>
<br>
I may be wrong here.
<br>
<br>
anyhiow they are all still patterns.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THE HAMN FACE
<br>
<br>
<br>
there are 48 muscles in most faces that move.
<br>
<br>
Whne you look at some one you detect certain facial points, colours, chigh cheeks bones that gives clues to testosterone levels 9similarly length of jaw0 similarity to pattern match repreneting you/your family/
<br>
<br>
others you know.
<br>
<br>
We are most of us guilty of assuming someone reminds (recalls memory visual) us of someone else.
<br>
<br>
We are doing that by parren mnatching.
<br>
<br>
<br>
BEAUTY in definable as symetry plus a few other things representing health mainly, and if beiaty is fashion based , the prevailing fashion may indicate something that is an advantage in society.
<br>
<br>
Fat was great in famine and in regions famous for famine, is still estemed.
<br>
<br>
I dwell on patterns because I wrestle with their importance.
<br>
<br>
They are idiosyncratic ontologies.
<br>
<br>
Their use is movement in the environment where you have to detect objexcts accurately or perish.
<br>
<br>
The best pattern detectors would flourish.
<br>
<br>
<br>
the down side is lack of method in analysing/checking what you see..jumping to conclusions etc.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Charlie Chaplin sees a banana skin, steps over it and falls down a man hole.
<br>
<br>
I think jumping to patternation involves lots of this!
<br>
<br>
<br>
MACINE PATTERNS
<br>
<br>
machines are realy simple.
<br>
<br>
i hated experiomantal physics at school ,because i could figure the concepts out in 1/10 of the time it took to set up and clear away the aparatus.
<br>
<br>
I thought if the theory was accurate and complete (exhaustive) why bother doing any experiment?
<br>
<br>
I'm sure some one has an answer to this
