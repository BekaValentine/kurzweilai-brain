<div class="TeaserText">The Internet is a new metaphor for the human brain. It makes it possible for hundreds of millions of Web users to teach computers common-sense knowledge, similar to SETI@home's search for E.T., says Dr. David G. Stork, a leading AI researcher. This can even be accomplished just by playing games on the Net.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published March 7, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>The notion that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) will arise in the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> is neither particularly new nor particularly insightful (once you accept the premise that <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can appear in non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>), nevertheless it is a suggestion that deserves scrutiny so that we can judge the assumptions underlying it, its overall plausibility, be alert to indications it is or is not occurring and, for some of us, to suggest avenues to facilitate such a development.</p>
<p>First I should clarify, if only informally, what I mean by <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> in this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. I consider an artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> "intelligent" if it can recognize patterns, discern their parts and relations, learn and remember, communicate through an abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, have <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> and other "informal" <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> and make subtle inferences, plan, infer the goals and desires of others, appreciate double meanings as in irony, puns or deception, and <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> and respond to a changeable environment, all at the level of an average <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>.</p>
<p>You'll note that I don't demand such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> "be conscious" or "have a <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>" or "experience qualia" (such as the "redness" or "sweetness" of a cherry or pain upon touching fire). Philosophers have debated these latter properties for quite some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. For the purposes here, we should be satisfied with an unconscious "zombie" that behaves intelligently. Let me acknowledge immediately that building artificially intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is surely one of the hardest problems in all of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>Consider some of the models or metaphors for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of the last several hundred years. One of the earliest was due to Ren&#233; Descartes, who asked whether a complicated <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of pipes, gears, pulleys and other mechanical contraptions could in principle think. Two centuries later the metaphor to gain some currency was the telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>board; this properly acknowledged the role of the rich interconnections between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>The next dominant metaphor was the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and indeed this metaphor has been so compelling that some <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have been called "<a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s," as was so well illustrated by the <a class="thought" href="entries/hal_entry.html">HAL</a> 9000 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/kubrick_entry.html">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s <i>2001: A <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Odyssey.</i> In the midst of the ascendency of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-as-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> metaphor, there was a short, ill-fated digression in which a few scholars and an uncritical public <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/hologram_entry.html">hologram</a> was an acceptable metaphor for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.+</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>: New Metaphor for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a></h1><p>We're now entering a period of a new metaphor for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, indeed a new <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> for development of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s: the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. There are many <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> that make this metaphor compelling. The first is that the total computing power and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> potentially <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible over the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is enormous, and growing every day--by some estimates already greater than that of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>The second is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> matches that of a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> more faithfully than does that of a traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>. For instance, just as there is no "master" region of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, so too there is no centralized "master" or central processor guiding <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. Just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s making up a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are imprecise, faulty, and die, so too the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible over the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> contain imprecise or contradictory <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, have <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> faults, and are occasionally turned off or crash.</p>
<p>Just as <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are richly interconnected and communicate with a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> of neural spikes and electrical potentials, so too the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> are richly interconnected and communicate using fairly simple protocols and <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="entries/tcpip_entry.html">TCP/IP</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/html_entry.html">HTML</a>. Just as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> gets <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from sensors such as eyes and ears, so too, increasingly, is the Web becoming connected to sensors such as Webcams, Webmicrophones, telescopes, microscopes, barometers, as well as to <a class="thought" href="entries/pda_entry.html">personal digital assistant</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones and even kitchen appliances.</p>
<p>Just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> controls muscles for grasping and locomotion, so too are manipulators being connected to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> for watering gardens, opening doors, pointing telescopes, and much more. No metaphor is perfect, of course, and there are several areas where the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is unlike a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, nevertheless, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> seems to be the best current metaphor for the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, increasingly supplanting the large <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in this regard.</p>
<p>While the structural similarities between the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> may help enable the development of artificially intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s in the Web, the most important impetus underlying such a development comes from <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> and the value proposition of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> on the Web. <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a>ing, sorting, and interpreting <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on the Web is the "killer application" of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, and hundreds of millions of people want it and would be willing to pay for it. A broad range of people would like to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for images or video clips on the Web based on visual <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, to ask <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> questions and get summaries of large and diverse <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s on the Web, and so on.</p>
<p>Users also want these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to know their personal interests and preferences, the better to filter unwanted <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> such as <a class="thought" href="entries/spam_entry.html">spam</a> and to alert them to new <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> of personal interest. Likewise, as more and more commerce appears on the Web, corporations will seek intelligent bots to find the best price on goods and services, alert lawyers to key provisions in online legal documents, and much, much more. <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> is not going to build an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/hal_entry.html">HAL</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to run spaceships, but Web <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> providers, <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a> companies, Web <a class="thought" href="entries/portal_entry.html">portal</a> companies, and a broad range of corporations making transactions on the Web all strongly desire to add <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> to their <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources potentially available over the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> are immense, and ever more frequently these resources are being used for large collaborative projects. One of the earliest and most noteworthy is <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a><i>@home</i>, where (at present) three million individual <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have contributed the equivalent of 60000 years of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly filtering radio telescope signals in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> of indications of extraterrestial <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. A similar project is <i>AIDS@home</i>, which assists in the discovery of AIDS therapies.</p>
<p>Several startup companies are trying to commercialize such <a class="thought" href="entries/distributed_computing_entry.html">distributed computing</a> as well. For example, Entropia Corporation distributes large computing tasks of its (paying) client corporations to the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s of participating individuals. Such individuals are motivated to donate <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> on their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s because a portion of this collective computing resource is directed to philanthropic projects of their choice.</p>
<p>Such raw <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power is but one requirement for intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s--one that frankly I feel has been overrated. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>--that on virtually all criteria such as speed, performance, and cost, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> improves by a factor of two roughly every 18 months--is indeed the rising tide that lifts all boats in the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> age.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a>, however, obeys no such equivalent law of improvement. It is hard to argue that <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/unix_entry.html">UNIX</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> or even proprietary applications such as spreadsheets, word processing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s such as speech recognizers have improved significantly over the last two decades--surely they haven't improved nearly as much as <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Current <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s have the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power of a fly's nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, nevertheless despite the existence of reconstructions of the fly's neural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and much <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic effort, we still lack the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to duplicate a fly's ability to recognize objects, perform rapid flight control, and identify substances by smell or taste. In short, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, more than <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, is the bottleneck associated with the construction of most <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>A key ingredient needed for the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is <i><a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a></i>. Indeed, there is theoretical and experimental evidence that it is the lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that is retarding development of many <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s such as speech recognizers, handwritten character recognizers, <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ers and many others.</p>
<p>For instance, state-of-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> speech recognizers are trained with hundreds or thousands of hours of representative spoken words along with their corresponding written transcriptions. Traditionally, in a commercial setting, <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers enter such <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> by hand--the more the better--and the resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> is then a vital, guarded <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> asset.</p>
<p>In the public arena, the Defense Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects Agency has funded the work of the Linguistic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> Consortium, which has collected, transcribed and processed a wealth of linguistic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>--everything from spoken Mandarin to parts of speech in sentences from several <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is distributed widely and has become vital to the development of many artificial speech recognizers and <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and the more high-quality <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is available, the higher the performance of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>In a few domains--particularly finance, commerce and sports--some of the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> can be extracted from the Web by <a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">data mining</a>. In many other important cases, however, the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> simply doesn't exist on the Web, for instance handwritten characters with their transcriptions or <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. For instance, read the following two sentences, selected <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011222727/http://www.tnpc.com/parentalk/infancy/infant4.html" target="_new">nearly randomly</a>  from the Web:</p>
<blockquote>"Finding good places to eat with little ones can be difficult when traveling. You might even want to consider choosing a drive-in if you're traveling with a very fussy baby."</blockquote>
<p>Now consider the ambiguities in that passage:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Finding good places to eat"? I sometimes have difficulty finding good apples to eat. I don't want to eat a place; I'd rather be <i>at</i> a place and eat some <i>food</i>. How would a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> know the author means places <i>at which to eat</i>, rather than places <i>to be eaten</i>?</li>
<li> "Finding good places to eat with little ones"? I don't care if the place has "little ones" at it; in fact I prefer to go to a place that doesn't have any little ones. How would a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> know that in this sentence "with little ones" modifies "Finding" and not instead "good places"?</li>
<li>"eat with little ones"? I eat my sushi with chopsticks; I eat my sandwich with soup. How would I eat a place <i>by means of</i> "little ones" or <i>while also eating</i> "little ones"? Furthermore, how would a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> know the author meant here that "little ones" means "little people" and not little <i>places</i>?</li>
<li>"traveling"? Does this apply to traveling on a cruise ship? an airplane? a train? a submarine? or while commiting the foul in basketball of walking with the ball without dribbling it?</li>
<li>"very fussy"? Very fussy about what? food? place?</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of ambiguities pervade the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on the Web, and indeed all writing and discourse. We use tacit, <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to understand such sentences, and so must any artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The needed <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is called "tacit" or "informal" because we are rarely aware of it and we learn it indirectly through experience.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "When you're dead you stay dead," "<a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">Animal</a>s run faster forward than sideways," and "A mother is always older than her <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> son," even those these <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> facts were not explicitly taught to us in formal settings such as schools. Most importantly, up to now, such <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> has never been collected or <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible in any <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> on the Web.</p><h1>Open Mind Initiative</h1><p>Where might a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> get such "informal" <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> needed to understand those two apparently simple sentences? One company, <a class="thought" href="entries/cycorp_entry.html">Cycorp</a>, has invested nearly 350 person-years of effort over 17 years to enter such <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> by hand.</p>
<p>Another way, however, is to use the Web itself for collecting <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> contributed by non-expert Web users or "<a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s"; this is the approach of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011222727/http://www.openmind.org/" target="_new">Open Mind Initiative</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> world-wide collaborative effort to help develop intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. The Open Mind Initiative collects <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to teach <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s the myriad things which we all know and which underlie our general <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>The Initiative extends two important trends in the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>: the increasing number of collaborators per <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> project, and the decreasing average expertise of each contributor. In principle, hundreds of millions of Web users could contribute informal <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> through the Open Mind Initiative, and they need no more "expertise" than knowing how to point and click on a Web broswer.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011222727/http://www.openmind.org/commonsense" target="_new">Open Mind commonsense</a> project, for instance, <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s answer simple questions, fill in the blanks, describe the relation between two words, describe pictures, and so forth, all in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> facts. These could be used in <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> bots, <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s, smart games or other "intelligent" <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise in the Open Mind Initiative's handwriting recognition project, <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s view handwritten characters or handwritten words on a <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a> and type in a transcription. In all the Initiative's projects, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> acquisition is speeded by a technique called "interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>," where the tasks that are <i>most informative</i> to the classifier or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> are automatically presented to <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s.</p>
<p>There are other collaborative projects in which <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s freely contribute <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, but none quite like the Open Mind Initiative. For instance, <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> has begun a project in which <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s (whom they refer to as "clickworkers") classify satellite images online. However the <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> project does not exploit the power of interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and the contributed <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is not used to train intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> as in the Open Mind Initiative.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are several collaborative projects in which <a class="thought" href="entries/netizen_entry.html">netizen</a>s contribute short articles to an online encyclopedia, open to all and available for revision or amending. Here too, there is no training of classifier or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> as in the Open Mind Initiative.</p>
<p>Given the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> resources, emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> for training intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, and most importantly a strong value proposition and identified customer base, how might intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s develop on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>? A crucial step will be a growing number of frameworks for <i>sharing</i> learned informatio--not merely the raw <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> and informal <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> not currently on the Web. This may be in repositories (as might arise in the Open Mind Initiative) or <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from specializts. Bots and <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>s will dip into this growing self-monitoring <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p><h1>Fun and Games</h1><p>One development that was anticipated fully by few if any <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s or <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> writers is this: the emergence of fun and games as a driver of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Neither Jules Verne nor H. G. Wells nor <a class="thought" href="entries/clarke_entry.html">Arthur C. Clarke</a> nor <a class="thought" href="entries/dick_entry.html">Philip K. Dick</a> nor any but a handful of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> authors appreciated that fun and games act as an important impetus for improving and extending <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that the gross income of the videogame industry exceeds that of Hollywood and the feature film industry, that an astonishing proportion of young children (and many adults) own a Gameboy, that some children, barely able to speak, spend hours "feeding" and otherwise tending a 256-<a class="thought" href="entries/pixel_entry.html">pixel</a> image of a Pok&#233;mon on a tiny wristwatch-borne LCD screen, all would have surprised pre-1970 visionaries and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> writers alike. Of course, once <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> games exploded onto the scene, writers and <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s were quick to incorporate them into their visions, as for instance did Orson Scott Card in <i>Ender's Game</i> (1985).</p>
<p>We should not again underestimate the power of fun and games. Who knows what games will be played on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> on PCs and on smarter portable peripherals, <a class="thought" href="entries/pda_entry.html">personal digital assistant</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones. Just as children once played scavenger hunt or picked up a stick, tennis ball, piece of rope or tin can in the backyard to invent an informal game, perhaps someday there will be <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> tools and sophisticated trainable bots that allow players to romp in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> using resources and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that are not nominally "part of a game."</p>
<p>Imagine a chase game, with virtual opponents careening through <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s (e.g., finding the current temperature in Oslo), collecting <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from sensors (e.g., a live Webcam photo of the Eiffel Tower), controlling manipulators (e.g., a Web-connected <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> watering a garden) in games we can now only vaguely imagine. Building such a game would be a challenge since the game would compete with commercial games for players' attention. On the other hand, simple games such as Solitaire and Tetris manage to capture hundreds of trillions of <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> clicks worldwide so perhaps this challenge isn't so daunting after all. The more adaptive and intelligent such games, the more we can expect them to attract players.</p>
<p>Conversely, as described for the Open Mind Initiative, the more Web users play a game, the more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> will be learned "in the background"--<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that could be used in intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. For instance, imagine an online version of <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> in the Open Mind Initiative in which players answer questions, fill in the blanks, and so on, all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> unconsciously providing <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> and linguistic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>. A compelling game might attract players for hundreds of millions of hours in total, and given proper <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic safeguards on <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> quality, the resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> could be used to improve a range of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>What might be other indications that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is developing on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>? It is a truism that bots--<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that can move throughout the Web, read and process <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on Websites--will become increasingly powerful and intelligent. Currently bots find the best deal on an automobile or home loan or alert you to the publication of a book by a favorite author or news stories about your home town. Bots will learn more about your interests and preferences as you let them monitor your behavior online.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a> companies will improve and add more natural <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s and use far more <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>--and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>--based <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es and allow you to ask questions of <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s. An interesting development will be when a compelling game is written in which <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> can be collected, as described above.</p>
<p>How does the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> compare with other approaches? There have been interesting efforts at building <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> robots that interact with the world and people. The general <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> underlying the <a class="thought" href="entries/cog_entry.html">Cog</a> project at MIT, for instance, is that <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> arises in a collection of modules more or less specialized for different tasks--seeking novelty, seeing faces, grasping and moving, and so forth--and that a close link between perception and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> allows these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to learn from experience.</p>
<p>There are many attractive aspects of this <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, and I think this general "mixture-of-agents" <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> is promising indeed. My concern is that once something is learned by such an "embodied" <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>, it is difficult to transfer that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to other <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. For instance if based on visual and tactile feedback, a <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> learns how to reach and grasp, such specific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> would be hard to transfer to a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> having different number and types of manipulators.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is far less collaborative effort and computing power that can be brought to the project than in Web-based <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. Most importantly, the financial incentives for building such <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> robots pales in comparison to the immense incentives associated with Web-based <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>I must stress that I don't feel that large datasets alone are sufficient, nor that the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> on the Web is imminent. Our field has suffered mightily both in funding and public understanding due to overly zealous evangelists spouting hype, particularly during <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s early years.</p>
<p>We cannot allow that to happen again. Building cognitve <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is astoundingly difficult and most people--including many scientists--do not realize the magnitude of the problem. Some do not even realize the <i>existence</i> of problems such as automatic scene analysis, that is, making a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that could describe pictures such as appear in a magazine.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks deeply about this problem for an hour or so will realize this is one of the most profoundly hard problems in all of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, surely harder than putting a man on the moon or Mars. While we can all applaud the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in computing power, the problems lie more, I believe, in getting proper <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> representation and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, none of which have improved at the rate <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> has. We do have, though, a sufficiently strong value proposition and compelling "killer application," or at least "killer arena"--the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--and this gives me guarded <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, we are passing from the era where the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is supplanting the large, <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as the best metaphor and model for mind, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is becoming a <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> and commercial arena for the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. Collaborative projects--harvesting <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power and increasingly <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> power--are building blocks in the grand effort to build <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> on the Web.</p>
<p>We face the challenge of building intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s because it is useful, but also because we are curious about the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Building <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> allows us to better understand cognition in general, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cognition in particular, more deeply. It is surely one of the most worthwhile scientific endeavors of our age.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;Building cognitive system is astoundingly difficult and most people--including many scientists--do not realize the magnitude of the problem.... Anyone who thinks deeply about this problem for an hour or so will realize this is one of the most profoundly hard problems in all of science, surely harder than putting a man on the moon or Mars. 
<br>
<br>
Maybe, maybe not, depending on the approach.  Approach A might be "astoundingly difficult" whereas approach B might be a "no-brainer." 
<br>
<br>
I have thought about this, for much more than a thousand hours, and several things come to mind.  Number one, I don't think most people have properly defined what AI is.  Number two, I am skeptical as to whether humans can actually "program" AI.  The software that will BE AI, will have to write itself with the goal of solving certain problems heuristically.
<br>
<br>
I agree with James Martin in his assessment that AI (actually meaning Alien Intelligence), is "processes executed on a computer that are so complex that a human can neither follow the logic step-by-step nor come to the same result by any other means."  
<br>
<br>
Once you come to this definition, the "programming" of AI is basically the breeding of software that humans cannot write with the ability of such software to recognize patterns in data that humans could not possibly recognize.
<br>
<br>
If you interpret the task of creating AI in human man-hours, or with approach A, of course it will be "one of the most profoundly hard problems in all of science, surely harder than putting a man on the moon or Mars," as David Stork warns. 
<br>
<br>
But maybe it does not have to come to this.

AI on it's own is nothing special. Currently it is what AI researchers are researching with their limited computing resources. If you compare it to the technologies used in comercial software there is very little that isn't being used today.</p></td>

THAT would be a useful progression of A.I.
<br>
<br>
But we're talking about SAI (strong= posthuman A.I.)
<br>
<br>
This A.I. IS special.
<br>
<br>
there are 2 types of A.I.
<br>
<br>
WAI (Weak A.I. = disparate skills eg chess, search engines)
<br>
<br>
SAI (Strong A.I. = generalised problem solving  post human A.I.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
they are called weak and strong after weak and strong nuclear force, which referes tosize they opperate on.

It is same rigth as metaphor "computer". What is brain "computer" or 
<br>
"hologram" - question similar to "what is electron - wave or particle".
<br>
These metaphors describe different processes in brain.
<br>
"Computer" is acceptable for description of logical processes on 
<br>
set of symbols (little patterns as substitute for large complex patterns).
<br>
But "hologram" describe associative processes on set of patterns.
<br>
These associative processes are based on analogy between fuzzy patterns.
<br>
And metaphor "internet" is more acceptable for "society" or "community"
<br>
or "collective mind" then "brain".

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Andrey,
<br>
<br>
The wave-particle duality is a good analogy to "brain as dynamic hologram" versus "brain as symbol processor".
<br>
<br>
(I have wondered whether "conscious self-hood" obeys Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics; is "mind" like a Fermion or a Boson?)
<br>
<br>
The internet is more "collective mind" than "brain", at present.  Will it remain so?
<br>
<br>
For that matter, I wonder if our "individual" mind is better represented by a "virtual collection of personalities" or semi-independent actors, whose "negotiations" lead to a sense of single-self.  I think this bears upon the design of a good AGI.
<br>
<br>
Most visions of AI, even the very general "AGI", still seem to suggest that there will be a unique "top" to the pyramid, a "single thread of control" to which all other semi-autonomous processes are subordinate.  I wonder if the human mind really works that way, or if we simply imagine it does because we (naturally) give such weight to our "conscious" deliberate activities.
<br>

Yep, as tomas said, we dont need to design AI

<br>
It'll design itself pretty easily.

I know it can be done.

I saw the internet potential and rushed to pattent a system in 99 but where will it lead us.

how would you like to be so vulnerable to a man next door, that he could walkmon water/thru walls if he chose....would you feel safe?

He could one assumes, model the univesre and time travel backwatrds to extinguish your race and liquidise it for a laugh or goal that had mutated.

i suggest not getting stuck on the difficulties of a build.

<br>
<br>
take it from me there are at least three ways of doing it RIGHT NOW
