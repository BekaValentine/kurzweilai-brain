<br><p>Originally published April 2000 as an academic paper, Carnegie Mellon University. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001. Original article can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011042225/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/puddle.html" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s were invented recently to mechanize tedious manual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>al procedures. Such procedures were themselves invented only during the last ten millennia, as agricultural <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s outgrew village-scale social <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>s arose in our hominid ancestors during several million years of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the wild, and were themselves built on perceptual and motor mechanisms that had evolved in a vertebrate lineage spanning hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Bookkeeping and its elaborations exploit ancestral faculties for manipulating objects and following instructions. We recognize written symbols in the way our ancestors identified berries and mushrooms, operate pencils like they wielded hunting sticks, and learn to multiply and integrate by parts as they acquired village procedures for cooking and tentmaking.</p>
<p>Paperwork uses evolved skills, but in an unnaturally narrow and unforgiving way. Where our ancestors worked in complex visual, tactile and social settings, alert to subtle opportunities or threats, a clerk manipulates a handful of simple symbols on a featureless field. And while a dropped berry is of little consequence to a gatherer, a missed digit can invalidate a whole calculation. The peripheral alertness by which our ancestors survived is a distraction to a clerk. Attention to the texture of the paper, the smell of the ink, the shape of the symbols, the feel of the chair, the <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> down the hall, digestive rumblings, family worries and so on can derail a procedure. Clerking is hard work more because of the preponderance of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mentation it must suppress than the tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> it uses effectively.</p><h1>Ripples</h1><p>Like little ripples on the surface of a deep, turbulent pool, calculation and other kinds of procedural <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> are possible only when the turbulence is quelled. Humans achieve quiescence imperfectly by intense concentration. Much easier to discard the pesky abyss altogether: ripples are safer in a shallow pan. Numbers are better manipulated as <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> stones or <a class="thought" href="entries/abacus_entry.html">abacus</a> beads than in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. A few cogwheels in Pascal's seventeenth century <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> perform the entire procedure of addition better and faster than a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind. Babbage's nineteenth century <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a> would have outcalculated dozens of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and eliminated their errors. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s are effective because they encode the bits of surface <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> used in calculation, and not the millions of distracting processes churning the depths of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>The deep processes sometimes help. We guess quotient digits in long divisions with a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of proportion our ancestors perhaps used to divide food among mouths. Mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, unable to guess, plod through repeated subtractions. More momentously, geometric proofs are guided (and motivated!) by our deep ability to see points, lines, shapes and their symmetries, similarities and congruences. And true creative work is shaped more by upwellings from the deep than by overt procedure.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">Calculator</a>s gave way to Turing's universal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and grew to thousands, then millions and now approaching billions of storage locations and procedure steps per second. In doing so they transcended their paperwork origins and acquired their own murky depths. For instance, without great care, one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> process can spoil another, like a clerk derailed by stray <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s. On the plus side, superhumanly huge <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es, table lookups and the like can sometimes function like <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> deep processes. Newell, Simon and Shaw's <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> Theorist's massive <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es found proofs like a novice <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> logician. Gelernter's <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">Geometry</a> prover used large <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es and Cartesian coordinate arithmetic to equal a fair <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> geometer's visual <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">Expert system</a>s' large compilations of inference rules and combinatorial <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es match <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> experience in narrow fields. <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>'s giga-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>, opening and endgame books and carefully-tuned board evaluations defeated the top <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> player. Despite such isolated soundings, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s remain shallow bowls. No <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> even approaches the sensory and mental depths habitually manifest at the surface of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Lenat's common-<a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> encoding <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">Cyc</a>, about the most ambitious, would capture broad verbal <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> yet still lack visual, auditory, tactile or abstract understanding.</p>
<p>Many critics contrast <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s' superiority in rote work with their deficits of comprehension to conclude that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are prodigiously powerful, but universal <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> lacks some <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mental principle (of physical, situational or supernatural kind, per taste). Some <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> practitioners profess a related view: <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> is sufficient, but difficult unsolved conceptual problems keep us from <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming true <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. The latter premise can seem plausible for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing, but it is preposterous for sensing. The sounds and images processed by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ears and eyes represent megabytes per second of raw <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, itself enough to overwhelm <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s past and present. Text, speech and vision <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s derive meaning from from snippets of such <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> by weighing and reweighing thousands or millions of hypotheses in its <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. At least some of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> works similarly. Roughly ten times per second at each of the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>'s million effective pixels, dozens of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s weigh the hypothesis that a static or moving boundary is visible then and there. The visual cortex's ten billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s elaborate those results, each moment appraising possible orientations and colors at all the image locations. Efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> vision <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s require over 100 calculations each to make similar assessments. Most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> remains mysterious, but all its <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s seem to work about diligently as those in the visual <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Elsewhere I've detailed the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>l calculation to conclude that it would take on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 100 trillion calculations per second of computing-about a million present-day PCs-to match the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s functionality.</p>
<p>That number presumes an emulation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> at the scale of image edge detectors: a few hundred thousand calculations per second doing the job of a few hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al requirements would increase (maybe a lot) if we demanded emulation at a finer grain, say explicit representation of each <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>. By insisting on a fine grain we constrain the solution <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and outlaw global optimizations. On the plus side, by constraining the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> we simplify the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>! No need to find efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s for edge detection and other hundred-<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>-scale nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> functions. If we had good models for <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and a wiring diagram of a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, we could emulate it as a straightforward <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> simulation. The problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> would be reduced to merely <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ally--and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>ally--daunting work.</p>
<p>Alternatively we could try to implement the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s function at much larger than edge-detector grain. The solution <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> expands and with it the difficulty of finding globally efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, but their <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al requirements decrease. Perhaps <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s implementing humanlike <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a highly abstract way are possible on existing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, as <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> traditionalists imagine. Perhaps, as they also imagine, devising such <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s requires lifetimes of work by world-class <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a>es.</p>
<p>But it may not be so easy. The most efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s exhibiting <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> might exceed the power and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of present PCs manyfold, and devising them might be superhumanly difficult. We don't know: the pool is extremely murky below the ripples, and has not been fathomed.</p>
<p>(Very powerful optimizing <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>s could conceivably blur grain sizes by transforming <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> simulation <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s into super-efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> that preserves input-output behavior but resembles traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>s would surely need superhuman mental power (they would be singlehandedly solving the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> problem, after all), but perhaps of a relatively simple, idiot-savant, kind.)</p><h1>Puddles</h1><p>Each approach to matching <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> performance is interesting intellectually and has immediate pragmatic benefits. <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s outperform humans at important tasks, and many already earn their keep. Neural modeling is of great <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> interest, and may have medical uses. Efficient perception <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s are somewhat interesting to biologists, and useful in automating factory processes and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> entry.</p>
<p>But by which will succeed first? The answer is surely a combination of all those techniques and others, but I believe the perception route, currently an underdog, will play the largest role. <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>ing-type <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s are superb for consciously explicable tasks, but become unwieldy when applied to deeper processes. In part this is simply because the tasks deep in the subconscious murk elude observation. But also, the deeper processes are quantitatively different. A few bits of problem <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> ripple across the conscious surface, but billions of noisy neural signals seethe below. <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s will become more powerful and useful in coming decades, but I think comprehensive verbal <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, let alone sensory understanding, will continue to elude them. Entire <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, hormonal signals and interconnection plasticity included, may become simulable in coming decades, as imaging <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ation and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources rapidly improve. Such simulations will greatly accelerate neurobiological understanding, but I think not rapidly enough to win the race. Braitenberg, who analyses small nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and has designed artificial ones, notes the rule of "downhill <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> and uphill analysis"-it is usually easier to compose a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> with certain behaviors than to describe how an existing <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> manages to achieve them. Meager understanding and thus means to modify designs, the cost of simulating at a very fine grain and ethical hurdles as simulations approach <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale will slow the applications of neural simulations. But <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> Aibos should be interesting! No <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (as far as we know) ever developed from conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing down, nor from simulations of neural processes, and we really don't know how hard doing either may be. But the third approach is familiar ground.</p>
<p>Multicellular <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s with cells specialized for signaling emerged in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> explosion a half-billion years ago. In a game of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary one-upmanship (there's always room at the top!) maximum nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> masses doubled about every 15 million years, from fractional micrograms then to several kilograms now (with several abrupt retreats, often followed by accelerated redevelopment, when catastrophic events eliminated the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s). Our gadgets, too, are growing exponentially more complex, but 10 million times as fast: <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> foresight and culture enables bigger, quicker steps than blind Darwinian <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. The power of new <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s has doubled annually since the mid 1990s. The "edge operator" estimate makes today's PCs comparable only to milligram nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, as of <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s or the smallest vertebrates  (e.g. the 1 cm dwarf goby fish), but humanlike power is just thirty years away. A sufficiently vigorous development with well-chosen selection criteria should be able to incrementally mold that growing power in stages <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to those of vertebrate mental <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. I believe a certain kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> industry will do this very naturally. No great intellectual leaps should be required: when insight fails, Darwinian trial and error will suffice-each ancestor along the lineage from tiny first vertebrates to ourselves became such by being a survivor in its <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and similarly ongoing commercial viability will select intermediate <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> minds.</p>
<p>Building intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s by this route is like slowly flooding puddles to make pools. Existing <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> control and perception <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s seem muddy puddles because they compete in areas of deepest <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> expertise. <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, though equally shallow, comparatively shine by efficiently performing tasks humans do awkwardly and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s not at all. But if we keep pouring, the puddles will surely become deeper. That may not be true for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s: can pools be filled surface down?</p>
<p>Many of our sensory, spatial and intellectual abilities evolved to deal with a mobile lifestyle: an <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> on the move confronts a relentless stream of <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> opportunities and dangers. Other skills arose to meet the challenges of cooperation and competition in social groups. Elsewhere I've outlined a plan for commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> development that provides similar challenges. It will require a large, vigorous industry to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous solutions. Today the industry is tiny. Advanced robots have <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>like mentalities, besting <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> labor only rarely, in exceptionally repetitive or dangerous work. But I expect a mass market to emerge this decade. The first widely usable products will be guidance <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s for industrial transport and cleaning <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that three-dimensionally map and competently navigate unfamiliar spaces, and can be quickly taught new routes by ordinary workers. I have been developing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that do this. They need about a billion calculations per second, like the brainpower of a guppy! Industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be followed by mass-marketed utility robots for homes. The first may be a small, very autonomous <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> cleaner that maps a residence, plans its own routes and schedules, keeps itself charged and empties its dustbag when necessary into a larger container. Larger <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with manipulator arms and the ability to perform several different tasks may follow, culminating eventually in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale "universal" robots that can run application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s for most simple chores. Their 10-billion-calculation-per-second lizard-scale minds would execute application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s with reptilian inflexibility.</p>
<p>This path to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, incremental, reactive, opportunistic and market-driven, does not require a long-range map, but has one in our own <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. In the decades following the first universal robots, I expect a second generation with <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>like brainpower and cognitive ability. They will have a conditioned <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> mechanism, and steer among alternative paths in their application <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s on the basis of past experience, gradually adapting to their special circumstances. A third generation will think like small primates and maintain physical, cultural and psychological models of their world to mentally rehearse and optimize tasks before physically performing them. A fourth, humanlike, generation will abstract and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> from the world model. I expect the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be adopted from the traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> approach maligned earlier in this essay. The puddles will have reached the ripples.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a> should become the largest industry on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> early in this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, eclipsing the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> industry. The latter achieved its exalted status by automating marginal tasks we used to call paperwork. <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a> will automate everything else!</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hello Hans Moravec and other roboticists. Yes, I fully agree, we have to look to the primates to get new ideas and  new inspirations. We must take a closer look at the instincts, certainly. In my three books: A Dictionary of Human Instincts, Human Behavior: The New Synthesis, and Human Instincts Explained, you and other AI researchers will, I hope, find several useful things for your science: How intelligence and intellect have to be "more" innate than "ordinary" instincts, how the new and important Bronston heritability coefficient (for individual emmotions and intelligences) is increasing with age, etc. These books, I believe, are must reads for roboticists.

Most Sincerely, Nils K. Oeijord, Tromso, Norway </p></td>
