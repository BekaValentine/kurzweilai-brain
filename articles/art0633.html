<p>Robert A. Freitas Jr., J.D., published the first detailed technical

            <h3><b>Question 2: When and how did you first hear about molecular 
              nanotechnology? At what point did you decide to devote your career 
              to this field?</b></h3>
<p> The first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I ever <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about atomic-scale <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              was probably in 1977-78, when I was working on my first treatise-length 
              book project (<i>Xenology</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In Chapter 16 of that book, I hypothesized that &#8220;using molecular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 10 &#197; in size, 10<sup>10</sup> 
              microneurons could be packed into a space of a few microns&#8221; which 
              would be &#8220;small enough to hide inside a bacterium.&#8221;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>During my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.islandone.org/MMSG/aasm/" target="_blank">NASA work on self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s</a> in the summer of 1980, I wondered how small machine 
              replicators might be made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I 
              briefly studied the emerging micromachine <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but by the 
              time <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.foresight.org/EOC/index.html" target="_blank"><i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></i></a> 
              came out in 1986 I had temporarily left the field in pursuit of 
              more pragmatic opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In early 1994 I happened to pick up and read 
              a copy of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.foresight.org/UTF/Unbound_LBW/index.html" target="_blank"><i>Unbounding 
              the Future.</i></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This 
              was my first exposure to what has come to be known as molecular 
              nanotechnology (MNT).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I studied the detailed technical arguments presented 
              in <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.foresight.org/nano/Bookstore.html#anchor1025139" target="_blank">Nanosystems</a>,</i> 
              which confirmed what I had already suspected based on my own <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>&#8212;namely, 
              that the technical case for molecular nanotechnology was very solid. 
            <p> Having fully absorbed the MNT <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, I immediately realized 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> would be the single most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant application area 
              of this new technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In 
              particular, nanomedicine offered a chance for significant healthspan 
              (healthy lifespan) extension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It 
              also appeared that this objective could possibly be achieved within 
              the several decades of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> actuarially remaining to me and others 
              of my generation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But was anyone pushing it forward?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I contacted the <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> and learned 
              that nobody had yet written any <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic treatment of this area, 
              nor was anyone planning to do so in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>So I took up the challenge of writing <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i>, the 
              first book-length technical discussion of the potential medical 
              applications of molecular nanotechnology and medical nanorobotics. 
            <p> I&#8217;ve been writing the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> book 
              series since 1994.&#160; This technical book&#160;is my attempt 
              to&#160;rationally assess various possible nanorobotic capabilities 
              and medical systems to determine which ones might be plausible (and 
              which ones not) if we could build nanorobots at some point in the 
              future. The first volume (I) was published by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.landesbioscience.com/" target="_blank">Landes Bioscience</a> 
              in 1999 and is&#160;freely available online at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI.htm" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US">http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI.htm</span></a>.&#160; 
              The second volume (IIA) was also published by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.landesbioscience.com/" target="_blank">Landes Bioscience</a>, 
              in 2003, and is&#160;also freely available online at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size:

              I&#8217;m still writing the last 2 volumes (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIB.htm" target="_blank">IIB</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIII.htm" target="_blank">III</a>) of this 
              book series, an ongoing effort that&#160;will continue during 2005-2010. 
            <h3><b>Question 3: Recently, the Foresight community has de-emphasized 
              molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s in favor of a desktop manufacturing paradigm. 
              What brought about this shift? How will this change affect the field?</b></h3>
<p> While I&#8217;m not involved in the decisions of the Foresight Institute, 
              I believe the shift occurred primarily as an attempt to redirect 
              the often rancorous scientific debate away from the growing fears 
              of runaway motile free-range replicators, and away from the seeming 
              impossibility of building self-replicating machines (a prejudice 
              common to many ill-informed scientists), and towards a more rational 
              consideration of the underlying technologies and their benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The civility of the public discourse may improve as a result, 
              and to the extent that the mainstream scientific community begins 
              to pay attention, it is possible that the research funding situation 
              might also improve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I&#8217;m all 
              for it. 
            <p> However, the change probably won&#8217;t much affect the actual research 
              in the field, nor the achievement of useful results per dollar spent, 
              because in truth the distinction between &#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm" target="_blank">molecular 
              assemblers</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/5.9.4.htm" target="_blank">nanofactories</a>&#8221; 
              is largely cosmetic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>That 
              is, if you possess either one, you can use it either to replicate 
              itself or to build the other in very short order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Either one can be used equally well to build life-saving 
              medical nanorobots or life-denying nanoweapons, including everyone&#8217;s 
              favorite bugaboo, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.foresight.org/nano/Ecophagy.html" target="_blank">marauding ecophages</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Both assemblers and nanofactories are examples 
              of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/5.7.htm" target="_blank">molecular 
              manufacturing</a>, which depends at its core on some form of replicative 
              or massively-parallel fabrication and assembly capability in order 
              to be able to economically generate macroscale quantities of useful 
              end products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The two approaches differ mainly in their technical 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/5.7.htm#p13" target="_blank">design/performance 
              tradeoffs</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Each approach 
              has different strengths and weaknesses (as manufacturing systems) 
              that can be readily enumerated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I&#8217;ve been writing about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.13.2.htm" target="_blank">both 
              approaches</a> since the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.13.htm" target="_blank">1980 NASA 
              replicating factory study</a> &#8211; wherein I was actually the main 
              proponent for the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.13.2.2.htm" target="_blank">factory 
              approach</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The key thing is that molecular assemblers and 
              nanofactories are both molecular manufacturing systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Each requires almost exactly the same <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of 
              enabling technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Developing 
              those enabling technologies as soon as possible should be our primary 
              focus right now. 
            <h3><b>Question 4: Do you agree with those who claim that the desktop 
              manufacturing paradigm could become a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> by 2020?</b></h3>
<p> I would not be surprised if the fabrication of medical nanorobots 
              (and other useful nanorobotic systems) via molecular manufacturing 
              &#8211; whether via molecular assemblers or nanofactories &#8211; arrives during 
              the decade of the 2020s. 
            <p> As noted earlier, I undertook the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023827/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIII.htm" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> 
              book series in an attempt to establish a solid foundation for the 
              single most important future application of MNT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The book introduces a long-term vision for nanorobotic medicine 
              and articulates the technical underpinnings of that vision, so that 
              when the day arrives that we have the technology to build such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, 
              we&#8217;ll have a clearer idea what can be done with them, and how. 
            <p> More recently, to answer those who remain skeptical of the entire 
              MNT enterprise, including the possibility of medical nanorobotics, 
              I&#8217;ve turned my attention to figuring out how to build the nanorobots 
              &#8211; the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation of the long-term vision.&#160; My 
              early work on diamond mechanosynthesis is described in a lecture 
              I gave at the 2004 Foresight Conference in Washington DC, the text

            <h3><b>Question 10: The Foresight Institute is collaborating with

              to create a nanotechnology roadmap. What do you know about this 
              roadmap? Will it affect the mainstream scientific community's assessment 
              of molecular manufacturing?</b></h3>
<p> Actually, I don&#8217;t know anything about their roadmap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>They haven&#8217;t consulted me at all on this, and 
              I have no idea what they&#8217;re up to except what I &#8220;read in the newspaper&#8221;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I believe it is an attempt to involve mainstream players 
              in an assessment of possible development pathways leading toward 
              some flavor(s) of molecular manufacturing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Whether these flavor(s) will include some or 
              all of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> systems, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> systems, polymer systems, <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> 
              systems, metal systems, diamondoid systems, or something else, I 
              cannot say. 
            <p> Meanwhile, over the last two years Ralph Merkle and I have worked 
              hard to establish a small independent <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of research (both 
              theoretical and experimental) collaborators with a sharp focus on 
              the implementation of diamondoid molecular machine systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Last June we put together a simple draft implementation 
              flowchart that has about 100 boxes and lots of arrows, that starts 
              from where we are today and ends with the manufacturing of complex 
              molecular machine systems, including simple nanorobots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The plan includes specific theoretical and experimental milestones 
              in a particular sequence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>So 
              we&#8217;re in the process of simplifying (and implementing) our own &#8220;roadmap&#8221;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Perhaps this (or something like it) will eventually 
              be incorporated in the broader Foresight nanotechnology roadmap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
