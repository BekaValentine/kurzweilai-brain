              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a postbiological <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</div>

            <br>
            <p>The gambler had not expected to be here. But on reflection, he <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> he had shown some kindness in his time. And this place was even more
              beautiful and satisfying than he had imagined. Everywhere there were magnificent crystal chandeliers, the finest handmade carpets, the most sumptuous foods, and, yes, the most beautiful women, who seemed intrigued with their new heaven
              mate. He tried his hand at roulette, and amazingly his <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> came up time after time. He tried the <a class="thought" href="entries/gaming_entry.html">gaming</a>
              tables, and his luck was nothing short of remarkable: He won game after game. Indeed his winnings were causing quite a stir, attracting much excitement from the attentive staff, and from the beautiful women.</p>
            <p>This continued day after day, week after week, with the gambler winning every game, accumulating bigger and bigger earnings. Everything was going his way. He just kept on winning. And week after week, month after month, the gambler's
              streak of success remained unbreakable.</p>
            <p>After a while, this started to get tedious. The gambler was getting restless; the winning was starting to lose its meaning. Yet nothing changed. He just kept on winning every game, until one day, the now anguished gambler turned to
              the angel who seemed to be in charge and said that he couldn't take it anymore. Heaven was not for him after all. He had figured he was destined for the "other place" nonetheless, and indeed that is where he wanted to be.</p>
            <p> "But this is the other place," came the reply.</p>
            <p>That is my recollection of an episode of The Twilight Zone that I saw as a young child. I don't recall the title, but I would call it "Be Careful What You Wish For."1 As this engaging series was wont to do, it illustrated one of the
              paradoxes of human <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>: We like to solve problems, but we don't want them all solved, not too quickly, anyway. We are more attached to the problems
              than to the solutions.</p>
            <p>Take death, for example. A great deal of our effort goes into avoiding it. We make extraordinary efforts to delay it, and indeed often consider its intrusion a tragic event. Yet we would find it hard to live without it. <a class="thought"
                href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> gives meaning to our lives. It gives importance and value to time. <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> would
              become meaningless if there were too much of it. If death were indefinitely put off, the human psyche would end up, well, like the gambler in The Twilight Zone episode.</p>
            <p>We do not yet have this predicament. We have no shortage today of either death or human problems. Few observers feel that the twentieth century has left us with too much of a good thing. There is growing prosperity, fueled not
              incidentally by <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but the human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>
              is still challenged by issues and difficulties not altogether different than those with which it has struggled from the beginning of its
              recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
            <p>The twenty-first century will be different. The human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, along with the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>
              it created, will be able to solve age-old problems of need, if not desire, and will be in a position to change the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>
              in a postbiological <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Do we have the psychological capacity for all the good things that await us? Probably not. That, however, might change as
              well.</p>
            <p>Before the next century is over, human beings will no longer be the most intelligent or capable type of <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.
              Actually, let me take that back. The truth of that last statement depends on how we define human. And here we see one profound difference between these two centuries: The primary political and philosophical issue of the next century
              will be the definition of who we are.2</p>
            <p>But I am getting ahead of myself. This last century has seen enormous technological change and the social upheavals that go along with it, which few pundits circa 1899 foresaw. The pace of change is accelerating and has been since the
              inception of <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> (as I will discuss in the first chapter, this acceleration is an inherent feature of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>).
              The result will be far greater transformations in the first two decades of the twenty-first century than we saw in the entire twentieth century. However, to appreciate the inexorable logic of where the twenty-first century will bring
              us, we have to go back and start with the present.</p>
            <h1>Transition to the Twenty-First Century</h1>
            <p>Computers today exceed human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a broad variety of intelligent yet narrow domains such as playing chess, diagnosing certain
              medical conditions, buying and selling stocks, and guiding cruise missiles. Yet human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> overall remains far more supple and flexible.
              Computers are still unable to describe the objects on a crowded kitchen table, write a summary of a movie, tie a pair of shoelaces, tell the difference between a dog and a cat (although this feat, I believe, is becoming feasible today
              with contemporary neural nets--<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulations of human neurons),3 recognize humor, or perform other subtle tasks in which their human creators
              excel.</p>
            <p>One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this disparity in capabilities is that our most advanced computers are still simpler than the human brain--currently about a million
              times simpler (give or take one or two orders of magnitude depending on the assumptions used). But this disparity will not remain the case as we go through the early part of the next century. Computers doubled in speed every three
              years at the beginning of the twentieth century, every two years in the 1950s and 1960s, and are now doubling in speed every twelve months. This trend will continue, with computers achieving the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>
              capacity and computing speed of the human brain by around the year 2020.</p>
            <p>Achieving the basic <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and capacity of the human brain will not automatically result in computers matching the flexibility of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.
              The organization and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of these
              resources--the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>--is equally
              important. One approach to emulating the brain's <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> is through <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse
                engineering</a>--scanning a human brain (which will be achievable early in the next century) and essentially copying its neural circuitry in a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural
                computer</a> (a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designed to simulate a massive <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>
              of human neurons) of sufficient capacity.</p>
            <p>There is a plethora of credible scenarios for achieving human-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.
              We will be able to evolve and train a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> combining massively parallel neural nets with other paradigms to understand <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>
              and model <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, including the ability to read and understand written documents. Although the ability of today's computers to extract and learn
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from natural-<a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> documents is quite limited,
              their abilities in this <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> are improving rapidly. Computers will be able to read on their own, understanding and modeling what they have read, by
              the second decade of the twenty-first century. We can then have our computers read all of the world's literature-books, magazines, scientific journals, and other available material. Ultimately, the machines will gather <a class="thought"
                href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> on their own by venturing into the physical world, drawing from the full spectrum of media and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>
              services, and sharing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> with each other (which machines can do far more easily than their human creators).</p>
            <p>Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> achieves a human level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>,
              it will necessarily roar past it. Since their inception, computers have significantly exceeded human mental dexterity in their ability to remember and process <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.
              A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can remember billions or even trillions of facts perfectly, while we are hard pressed to remember a handful of phone numbers. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
              can quickly <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>
              with billions of records in fractions of a second. Computers can readily share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> bases. The combination of human-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>
              in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s
              inherent superiority in the speed, accuracy, and sharing ability of its <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> will be formidable.</p>
            <p>Mammalian neurons are marvelous creations, but we wouldn't build them the same way. Much of their <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is devoted to supporting their own
              life processes, not to their <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-handling abilities. Furthermore, neurons are extremely slow; <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
              circuits are at least a million times faster. Once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> achieves a human level of ability in understanding abstract concepts, recognizing
              patterns, and other attributes of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, it will be able to apply this ability to a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>
              base of all human-acquired--and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-acquired--<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
            <p>A common reaction to the proposition that computers will seriously compete with human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is to dismiss this specter based primarily
              on an examination of contemporary capability. After all, when I interact with my <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>, its <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>
              seems limited and brittle, if it appears intelligent at all. It is hard to imagine one's <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> having a sense of humor, holding
              an opinion, or displaying any of the other endearing qualities of human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>.</p>
            <p>But the state of the art in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is
              anything but static. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> capabilities are emerging today that were considered impossible one or two decades ago. Examples include the ability
              to transcribe accurately normal continuous human speech, to understand and respond intelligently to <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>, to recognize patterns
              in medical procedures such as electrocardiograms and blood tests with an accuracy rivaling that of human physicians, and, of course, to play chess at a world-championship level. In the next decade, we will see translating telephones
              that provide real-time speech translation from one human <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to another, intelligent computerized personal assistants that can converse and
              rapidly <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> and understand the world's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> bases, and
              a profusion of other machines with increasingly broad and flexible <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
            <p>In the second decade of the next century, it will become increasingly difficult to draw any clear distinction between the capabilities of human and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. The advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>
              in terms of speed, accuracy, and capacity will be clear. The advantages of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>,
              on the other hand, will become increasingly difficult to distinguish.</p>
            <p>The skills of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> are already better than many
              people realize. It is frequently my experience that when demonstrating recent advances in, say, speech or character recognition, observers are surprised at the state of the art. For example, a typical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
              user's last experience with speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> may have been a low-end freely bundled piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>
              from several years ago that recognized a limited vocabulary, required pauses between words, and did an incorrect job at that. These users are then surprised to see contemporary systems that can recognize fully continuous speech on a
              60,000-word vocabulary, with accuracy levels comparable to a human typist.</p>
            <p>Also keep in mind that the progression of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>
              will sneak up on us. As just one example, consider Gary Kasparov's confidence in 1990 that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would never come close to defeating him. After
              all, he had played the best computers, and their chess-playing ability--compared to his--was pathetic. But <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chess playing made steady <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>,
              gaining forty-five rating points each year. In 1997, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
              sailed past Kasparov, at least in chess. There has been a great deal of commentary that other human endeavors are far more difficult to emulate than chess playing. This is true. In many areas--the ability to write a book on computers,
              for example--computers are still pathetic. But as computers continue to gain in capacity at an exponential rate, we will have the same experience in these other areas that Kasparov had in chess. Over the next several decades, <a class="thought"
                href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> competence will rival--and ultimately surpass--any particular human skill one cares to cite, including our marvelous ability to place our ideas in a broad <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>
              of contexts.</p>
            <p>
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> has been seen as a billion-year drama that led inexorably to its grandest creation: human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.
              The emergence in the early twenty-first century of a new form of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>
              that can compete with, and ultimately significantly exceed, human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will be a development of greater <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>
              than any of the events that have shaped human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. It will be no less important than the creation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>
              that created it, and will have profound implications for all aspects of human endeavor, including the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of work, human <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>,
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a>, the arts, and our concept of ourselves.</p>
            <p>This specter is not yet here. But with the emergence of computers that truly rival and exceed the human brain in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> will come a
              corresponding ability of machines to understand and respond to abstractions and subtleties. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> beings appear to be complex in part because of our
              competing internal goals. Values and emotions represent goals that often conflict with each other, and are an unavoidable by-product of the levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>
              that we deal with as human beings. As computers achieve a comparable--and greater--level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, and as they are increasingly derived at
              least in part from models of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, they, too, will necessarily utilize goals with implicit values and emotions, although not
              necessarily the same values and emotions that humans exhibit.</p>
            <p>A variety of philosophical issues will emerge. Are computers <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, or are they just calculating? Conversely, are human beings <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>,
              or are they just calculating? The human brain presumably follows the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>,
              so it must be a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, albeit a very complex one. Is there an inherent difference between human <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>? To pose the question another way, once
              computers are as complex as the human brain, and can match the human brain in subtlety and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>,
              are we to consider them conscious? This is a difficult question even to pose, and some philosophers believe it is not a meaningful question; others believe it is the only meaningful question in <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>.
              This question actually goes back to <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a>'s time, but with the emergence of machines that genuinely appear to possess volition and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>,
              the issue will become increasingly compelling.</p>
            <p>For example, if a person scans his brain through a noninvasive scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the twenty-first century (such as an advanced magnetic
              resonance imaging), and downloads his mind to his <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>, is the "person" who emerges in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
              the same <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> as the person who was scanned? That "person" may convincingly implore you that "he" grew up in Brooklyn, went to college
              in Massachusetts, walked into a scanner here, and woke up in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> there. The original person who was scanned, on the other hand, will
              acknowledge that the person in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> does indeed appear to share his <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>,
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and personality, but is otherwise an
              impostor, a different person.</p>
            <p>Even if we limit our discussion to computers that are not directly derived from a particular human brain, they will increasingly appear to have their own personalities, evidencing reactions that we can only label as emotions and
              articulating their own goals and purposes. They will appear to have their own <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>. They will claim to have spiritual experiences. And
              people--those still using <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based neurons or otherwise--will believe them.</p>
            <p>One often reads predictions of the next several decades discussing a variety of demographic, economic, and political trends that largely ignore the revolutionary impact of machines with their own opinions and agendas. Yet we need to
              reflect on the implications of the gradual, yet inevitable, emergence of true competition to the full range of human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> in order to comprehend
              the world that lies ahead.</p>
