<p><i>Originally published in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813/http://www.wie.org/_flash/default.asp" target="_blank">What 
              Is Enlightenment? Magazine</a> Spring/Summer 2003. Excerpts published 
              on KurzweilAI.net October 16, 2003.</i></p>
<p><b>WIE:</b> <i>You mentioned earlier that as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings we naturally 
              seek to expand our horizons, and that in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> we will do so 
              largely through the expansion of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Do you see the 
              expansion of human intelligence as an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary end in itself? 
              </i></p>
<p><b>RK:</b> Well, it's a good question. It's like asking, "What 
              is the purpose of life?" In my <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, we will ultimately saturate 
              all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in our area of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> with our 
              intelligence, and I suppose you could say that's an end in itself. 
              All of this dumb matter and energy around us will wake up and become 
              sublimely intelligent. Then it will spread out to the whole universe 
              at the fastest speed <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can flow. And one could make an 
              argument that it's not going to take an infinitely long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> because 
              there may be other ways to get to other parts of the universe through 
              shortcuts like wormholes, which <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> has postulated. Eventually 
              the whole universe will, essentially, wake up.</p>
<p><img height="266" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/(WIE) futurespread_72dpi.jpg copy.jpg" width="400"></p>
<p>But isn't it interesting that you never see cosmologists give any 
              role to intelligence in the future destiny of the universe? Rather, 
              they talk a lot about whether or not the universe will contract 
              back to a <a class="thought" href="entries/big_crunch_entry.html">big crunch</a> or expand indefinitely, as if these sorts of 
              mindless forces of physics are just going to endlessly grind on 
              like a big dumb <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. </p>
<p>Nowhere do they consider, "Now, wait a second, intelligence could 
              spread through the universe and actually make an intelligent decision 
              about what the destiny of the universe is, and even though the gravitational 
              force and other forces might cause the universe to spin apart, the 
              intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> infusing the whole universe will decide, 
              'No, we're not going to do that. We're going to do something different.'"</p>
<p><b>WIE:</b> <i>Some scientists and cosmologists argue that the 
              universe is already intelligent. But what you're saying is that 
              we will use <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to inject our own intelligence into the nonintelligent 
              matter of the universe, that it's a purely physical accomplishment.</i></p>
<p><b>RK: </b>Exactly. And that's a form of enlightenment. Because 
              I would say that the whole universe is <i>not</i> intelligent at 
              this point. But I think it will become intelligent through the process 
              that I described. </p>
<p><b>WIE: </b><i>How do you see that happening on a practical level? 
              Can you envision it?</i></p>
<p><b>RK:</b> Well, yes. We can state the fact that levels of intelligence 
              far greater than our own are going to evolve within this century. 
              We can't entirely describe what that will be like because it will 
              be, by definition, more intelligent than we are. As we move through 
              three-dimensional molecular computing, we're ultimately going to 
              be organizing matter and energy in a very efficient way, down to 
              the atomic level. In about twelve years, we'll be able to compute 
              very efficiently with these three-dimensional molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s, 
              which actually are based on <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>, much like <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is, but organized 
              millions of times more powerfully. </p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/(WIE)%20Kurzweil_72dpi.jpg"></p>
<p>A one-inch tube of nanotube <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry built out of carbon atoms 
              would be a million times more powerful than the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Using 
              these incredibly small information-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, which have 
              the ability to reorganize matter, we'll ultimately be able to convert 
              most of the matter and energy in our area of the universe into very 
              efficiently organized processes for running intelligence. </p>
<p>And then, this intelligence will expand outward, almost like information, 
              but it will actually be able to essentially convert and absorb into 
              itself all the matter and energy that it encounters as it continues 
              to spread outward into the universe.&#160; </p>

<br>
<br>
Already this is starting to seem problematic. In a year when previously unthinkable blackouts affected well over 100 million people in North America and Europe, we are seeing plenty of evidence that the developed world's energy infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating. Just the other day the British press ran stories about how the U.K. is vulnerable to massive blackouts this winter.
<br>
<br>
There is an alternative, inductive model that predicts our future between now and the year 2030: Richard C. Duncan's "Olduvai Theory," based on an empirical measurement of the world's per capita energy consumption, which has been trending downwards since the late 1970's. And this model's predictions are fundamentally at odds with Transhumanist speculations.

Read especially the part where Duncan discusses the rash of permanent blackouts likely to start by 2012 or so.</p></td>

Many experts are predicting that world oil

production will peak and then begin to fall
<br>
rapidly within the next ten years or so, but
<br>
there is no shortage of alternate possibilites.
<br>
Just as computing moves from one paradigm to
<br>
another when the first one runs it course, so
<br>
the same will happen with energy. Few people
<br>
want to spend even one day in the cold and dark,
<br>
so that would be a great motivator for finding
<br>
other solutions (Necessity: the mother of

invention). On Long Island there is currently
<br>
a project to provide 2% or so of electricity
<br>
needs using offshore wind turbines by something
<br>
like 2007, and it could eventually be possible
<br>
to supply as much as 75% that way. My main concern is not that we won't have energy, we certainly will, but rather that (i) this could lead to shocking price increases and (ii) that we find a way to avoid coal and other less environmentally friendly solutions.</p></td>

of supplying 75% of electricity needs from wind

power is for Long Island only. For North America

as a whole, wind would, of course, be far less.
<br>
Britain is aiming to supply 15% of its need

that way.
<br>
<br>
By the way, nuclear will continue to be an
<br>
important part of the mix, but it is not
<br>
unproblematic, being somewhere in desirability between coal and "clean" energy sources. If anyone thinks that relying on a strategy
<br>
dominated by nuclear would be wise, I'd like

to know how many more nuclear plants they think

could be built after terroists blow one up. </p></td>

I've been concerned about the Hubbert peak in the past - and recognize that there is still potential that it may be happening.  But even if we're at the peak right now, it probably won't be widely recognized for several years.  
<br>
<br>
Far more influencial on oil production will be world events - e.g. if radical Islam gained effective control over ~50% of the world's oil, then used it as an economic weapon.  
<br>
<br>
However, the source for U.S. electric power is mostly coal, followed by nuclear and natural gas, then hydro, and finally oil way down around 2%-3%.  
<br>
<br>
So - we've got some infrastructure problems, and certainly oil getting more expensive would add somewhat (via transport costs) to the cost of coal and gas - but we're nowhere near running out of the latter, even if we might be close to a Hubbert peak for oil.</p></td>

North America's natural gas situation is becoming critical, despite all the sophistical arguments from free-market ideologues to the contrary. Refer to:

Demand outpaces gas production

<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> The natural gas industry faces a year of conflicting extremes in 2004.
<br>
<br>
Houston-based and multinational energy companies will pursue a number of extremely huge exploration and production projects in the Gulf of Mexico.
<br>
<br>
But the amount of natural gas they supply, although substantial, will be woefully inadequate to offset a U.S. production rate that continues to dwindle at an extremely rapid pace.
<br>
<br>
And events like the freezing cold snap that hit much of the country in December and caused gas prices to spike 50 percent only represent the tip of the iceberg.
<br>
<br>
This bleak assessment of the disparity between expanding production and shrinking supply comes from Houston energy guru Matthew Simmons.
<br>
<br>
The president of Simmons &amp; Co. International, an energy investment bank, believes the United States faces a serious natural gas crisis that could have a devastating impact on the national economy.
<br>
<br>
And Simmons is not alone.
<br>
<br>
In October, the National Petroleum Council (NPC) revised its official natural gas outlook with a 180-degree turn.
<br>
<br>
Four years ago, the council was projecting a bright future for the fuel, with ample supplies and prices averaging under $3 through 2015.
<br>
<br>
Now the NPC is saying that, "there has been a fundamental shift in natural gas supply/demand balance that has resulted in higher prices and volatility."
<br>
<br>
As a result, the NPC has lowered gas production estimates for North America by 22 percent, or 7.5 trillion cubic feet per year -- more than 16 billion cubic feet a day. </p></center>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The only long-term solution to Earth's Energy Problem in my opinion is PLASMA FUSION: the most powerful energy in the known Universe. Not coal. Not solar. Not natural gas. Not wind or hydro. And not nuclear FISSION: the SPLITTING of atoms. Nuclear fission, usually called -- nuclear energy -- has serious waste disposal problems connected with its technology. It also has other problems like having the potential to render a 100-square mile area of civilization radioactive for 25,000 years. Sure there have not been any Chernobyl's or Three Mile Islands lately, but the next one becomes more probable to the degree we set any more of this risky technology loose on the public. That said, Pebble-Bed reactors show safe promise and should possibly be investigated by the U.S. as China is now doing.(2)
<br>
<br>
Plasma FUSION: the JOINING of atoms -- is the only viable long-term answer on the horizon for heavy electrical requirements because it's robust and its only by-products are heat and water. More importantly, it's the only energy source we know of that will be able to meet goals of the ENTIRE human race, as extrapolated, since pre-industrial revolution demands. Until and unless long-term requirements are confronted, it is impossible to rationally select energy solutions. If you don't know WHAT your energy requirements will be in the next 50, 100, 200 years, how are you going to be able to select a viable DIRECTION to even START moving in? At the rate global civilization is increasing its demand, some 2.5% per year, even exploiting (destroying) the entire Alaska wilderness for oil will only yield an additional 5 years. Some studies say 1 year. So is it worth it? I say no. It's a misallocation of attention and intention. Right now the human race is WANDERING around in a fog just trying to cope. It has NO IDEA which DIRECTION it needs to go to survive and advance in the long-term. The answer to this dilemma is tied up in energy -- for WITHOUT SUFFICIENT ENERGY ALL LIFE SUPPORTING INDUSTRIES WILL EVENTUALLY CEASE TO EXIST.
<br>
<br>
The planet, meaning all countries and all of these countries' industries, will need 200 terawatts of power each and every year by the year 2100. That's less than 100 years from now. Again, your kids will probably STILL be alive. YOU may still be a live too, if therapeutic cloning becomes a widespread reality in time. (See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813/http://www.advancedcell.com/" target="_blank">http://www.advancedcell.com</a> and The Immortal Cell by Michael D. West) Plasma fusion is the only technology that will be able to give us the necessary energy in 100 years and on.
<br>
<br>
Fusion is also the only energy that will give us rocket engines powerful enough to explore the Solar System in any meaningful way, when we're ready for it. And we WILL be ready for it starting in the coming decade. Thus, unless there is a major breakthrough in some other energy source, plasma fusion is the ticket, and we should stop wasting money and resources trying to develop other alternatives that will just place us into an endless "cope" cycle. This includes even placing too much hope in nanotechnology unless it leads aggressively to solar power and/or other useful, safe technologies. As much as I am romanced by the nanotech meme, no evidence of inorganic nanotechnology has been observed in the Universe. Thus it is highly doubtful if full Drexlerian INorganic nanotechnology is in fact possible. ORGANIC nanotechnology, such as bacteria and the ribosome, may well be the only forms of nanotechnology possible. Thus for us to sit around waiting for nanotechnology to present us with a technical deus ex machina (such as even in the case with nano-assissted solar technology) may be a big waste of time and energy. Also, zero-point energy (a.k.a. vacuum energy, dark energy, cosmological constant energy) and the Patterson Cell may be possible -- but tapping these are much more pie-in-the-sky. We need to focus about 75% of our resources on plasma fusion -- now! Not 100%, but 75%.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Future Energy Demands:
<br>
<br>
Count on it, Earth will need, want and demand a cumulative 10,000 terawatt-years of power over the next century and 200 TWs per year, and up, by the year 2100. Economizing will NOT work and those that think this is the way to go are being foolhardy. Civilizations DON'T economize, unless they're radically succumbing (a possibility that some of the more irresponsible powers-that-be act as if they want). So, we must push the fusion button to its sustainable point and get the job done. We are doing this now and should have sustainable reactions soon IF there is enough private and governmental money and thought allocated in this direction. Unfortunately we may not be able to count on governments to do this because they seem to be part of the problem. The reaction we ultimately need to gain mastery over is the deuterium-helium 3 reaction (D-He3 reaction) because this reaction is much cleaner than the deuterium-deuterium reaction (a reaction which eats away the walls of the outer chamber). In fact the D-He3 reaction is so clean and powerful, it produces the highest energy-to-mass ratio of any reaction found in nature. Why do you think stars us it? The Universe isn't dumb. Are we? 
<br>
<br>
But here's the killer: there's no Helium-3 on Earth, thus we will have to eventually set up mining colonies on the Moon. The Moon is the closest place in the Solar System we can get Helium-3, so we'll we need to start mining He3 off the Moon by at least the year 2010 and be totally routine with such operations by the year 2025. Why? Because the supply of He3 will probably only give us only about 10,000 terawatt-years of energy. And MUCH of this energy may be needed for large nuclear/electric propulsion engines (and eventually fusion engines) that will be necessary to mine the Gas Giants, starting with Jupiter. Why will we have to go to the Gas Giants? For more Helium-3 obviously. The Gas Giants are the Persian Gulf of the Solar System when it comes to Helium-3. Jupiter alone has 5,600,000,000 terawatt-years of Helium-3, enough fuel to not only handle Earth's energy problems for millennia, but enough energy to explore and settle the entire Solar System. More importantly, how do you think we are ever going to get OUT of this Solar System and become a Type III, starfaring civilization? We'll need to mine the OTHER gas giants for their 8.3 billion terawatt-years of Helium-3 because we'll need a lot of this to power the super nuclear powered rocket engines that will be capable of getting us up to at least 5% of the speed of light. 
<br>
<br>
So it's obvious to me, the Universe has laid out all the resources we need to take each baby step in our civilization's evolution. All we have to do is keep the ignorant and destructive morons off our backs long enough to get things done and meet targets. And foremost on the way to meeting conditional, operating and production targets, we MUST keep the oil cartels in the world energy Establishment from totally screwing up the biosphere (environment) and suppressing entrepreneurs who will cause the world to segue into a clean energy system based on plasma fusion (and nano-asisted solar). It will be a challenge, but the entire future of Earth, as well as the Solar System and possibly even our Galaxy depends on how we handle our resources, here and now, and as the Universe presents them at each new level of our technological and biological evolution.(3)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Funding Plasma Fusion and Solar:
<br>
<br>
If ample sums were allocated each year to the development of plasma fusion (even 11% of what we spend on the annual military budget of $440 billion in the U.S.), plasma fusion could be a reality within 10 - 20 years. Steps in fusion are already being taken, but not enough. (See ITER at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813/http://www.iter.org/" target="_blank">http://www.iter.org</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061121.wnuclearfusion1121/EmailBNStory/Business" target="_blank">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM  .20061121.wnuclearfusion1121/EmailBNStory/Business</a>  /home) The projection of 50 to 100 years would be seen to be pessimistic in light of ample funding for research AND because it doesn't take into consideration the law of accelerating returns. (See Ray Kurzweil's book, The Singularity is Near available at Amazon). Plasma fusion would give Earth the needed 200 terawatts per year by 2100 and do it without further damage to the biosphere. Large plasma fusion plants could be located safely around the world and in Earth orbit to generate enormous amounts of clean electrical power, power that could be transmitted anywhere. Such plants generate sufficient electricity to crack hydrogen out of water, a virtually unlimited resource on Earth and hydrogen, by far, the most abundant element in the Universe. The hydrogen could then be used, not only to feed the fusion process, but as a "storage medium" for use in fuel cells and/or fuel for internal combustion engines that were adapted for hydrogen. Thus, the transportation industry and electricity-intensive industries could be supplied with limitless amounts of electricity originated from clean, renewable plasma fusion plants.
<br>
<br>
At the same time plasma fusion is being developed and distributed, solar technology could be developed for use in homes and small business. Since a home uses a relatively small amount of energy compared to an automobile, solar energy will soon reach a point where it will be able to supply the needed wattage to run all of the appliances and heating/cooling systems in a house or small business. This technology, with ample funding, will arrive easily by 2006, especially if the public intensifies political pressure to make it happen.(4)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary of Factors to Consider:
<br>
<br>
1. We will reach peak oil by 2020 but PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY REACHED IT. 
<br>
<br>
2. CO2 build-up and global warming are serious, but potentially reversible given that advanced nano- or bio-engineering will be available later in this century. 
<br>
<br>
3. Continued use of fossil fuels will contribute to CO2 build-up and, as a result, global warming, thus fossil fuels (i.e., oil, coal, natural gas, etc.) are no longer an option. 
<br>
<br>
4. Solar, wind and hydro cannot provide enough energy to meet needs now, let alone when we need 50 terawatts of power per year by mid-century and close to 200 terawatts per year by 2100. The new solar cells being developed in South Africa are promising for houses, as the original edition of this article predicted.(4) 
<br>
<br>
5. Nuclear FISSION is too dangerous and waste is a serious problem; plus uranium is a limited and non-renewable resource. 
<br>
<br>
6. Some falsely believe plasma fusion is between 50 and 100 years away from deployment, thus insufficient attention is paid to it. 
<br>
<br>
7. The current Energy Establishment may or may not be part of the Next Energy Establishment, but, in fact, all, or most of them, are clearly inhibiting the transition in order to amortize their $10 trillion infrastructure. This infrastructure is probably already amortized (i.e., bank loans paid off), but they would never admit this because to admit it would cause a decrease in profits, so they imagine. 
<br>
<br>
8. The amount of money allocated towards energy research from the annual national budget is pitiful and the amount allocated to plasma fusion development is bordering on criminal. The U.S. spends less than $1 billion a year on domestic alternative energy development whereas it freely spends $440 billion a year on the death and destruction through the military. Again, government may not be the solution and thus private capital will have to intervene.
<br>
<br>
Given 1 - 8 above, as well as the data in numerous books and testimony by investment bankers (such as Matt Simmons), my conclusion is this: PLASMA FUSION supplemented by SOLAR are the only viable, long-term solutions to Earth's energy problem.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion:
<br>
<br>
Homes/small business could be operated on SOLAR energy and heavy industry/transportation could be operated on PLASMA FUSION. Earth's Energy Problem would thus be completely solved for the foreseeable future and well into the next 500 years by using a coordinated combination of: 
<br>
<br>
A. CENTRALIZED FUSION POWER
<br>
B. DISTRIBUTED SOLAR POWER 
<br>
<br>
The combination of FUSION and SOLAR would give the world a virtually infinite amount of clean, inexhaustible energy -- plus the added dividend of enough power to develop high-impulse fusion rocket engines that will be necessary to open the door to the manned exploration of the Solar System and its colonization over the next 500 years. 
<br>
<br>
Given the short- and long-term benefits of a Fusion/Solar Energy Establishment, humanity should immediately begin allocating the necessary financial and intellectual resources to their focused development and deployment. 
<br>
<br>
All else is a waste of time and money. 
<br>
<br>
All fossil fuel technologies are counter-productive. 
<br>
<br>
No energy technology other than plasma fusion will be sufficient. 
<br>
<br>
Economizing is NOT an option for a growing, young planetary civilization. 
<br>
<br>
Since energy is a common need of ALL people and all industries, whether in developed or developing nations, the creation and deployment of A and B should really be a WORLD WIDE project lead by the United States. As a demonstration of good faith, the U.S. should allocate about 10% of its military budget ($50 billion per year) toward the development and deployment of plasma fusion. Other countries should contribute 2% of their annual military budgets as well and if they have no defense budget they should contribute by reducing their population by 2% per year. 
<br>
<br>
The calculus of the above would eventually lead to less ability and need to wage wars as a "solution" to problems, especially problems caused by limited energy. Once war, and those who use and profit from it, are gradually removed from power, civilization will be able to allocate increasing amounts of its energy to increasing the standard of living on Earth, thus all the "reasons" for war as a "solution" to anything will systematically become obsolete. Again, one of the primary "reasons" governments and "leaders" embroil their citizens in war is to secure energy, such as oil, by force, if necessary. Such reasons for war become untenable when energy is abundant and thus able to bolster the production of abundant, quality products. In short, wars ALWAYS do more damage than they do good. Wars always destroy more resources than they create. 
<br>
<br>
Again, if the above steps are taken, the energy dividend will pay off in all industries, making all products and services less expensive and higher in quality. If, while this productivity transformation is taking place, countries lead by the United States, could remove themselves from fiat money standards and re-adopt sound money standards, the excess productivity caused by the energy dividend would not be absorbed by government expansion, perpetual wars, empire building, socialist programs and waste. Thus, benefits would accrue to people and private industry. 
<br>
<br>
The combination of a clean and infinite new Energy Establishment and a Sound Money Establishment would usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and expansion. The human race would thus, for the first time in history, be in a position to attain full Class I status as a global civilization -- Class I meaning, having the ability to fully and economically utilize the resources of its host planet. Class I status would thus close the door on war as an option for the resolution of conflict and open the door to the remedy of the scarcity of material possessions thus leaving human beings in a position to spend considerably more time pursuing education, entertainment, new product development, spiritual enlightenment and exploration. 
<br>
<br>
All problems, no matter how simple or complex, are related. They are solvable by addressing the problems that have the most common elements first, and then moving down the list of priorities to problems that have no common elements. ENERGY is common to all products, services and human activities. MONEY is common to all products, services and most human activities. Money is a form of energy, thus money and energy are, in many ways, flip sides of the same coin and collectively the most common elements of all of humanities' secular problems. Thus these two problems should be addressed and remedied first but probably simultaneously. If this could happen, a solution to WAR, CRIME, IGNORANCE, WASTE, INEFFICIENCY, MATERIAL SCARCITY, OVER-POPULATION, DISEASE, POLLUTION, GLOBAL WARMING, TRANSPORTATION, TRUNCATED-LONGEVITY and all other problems would manifest in sequence. 
<br>
<br>
But it all starts by properly solving Earth's Energy Problem. 
<br>
<br>
Listen to the scientists, not the politicians and not the MONEY-mentality (i.e., people only motivated by money, power and prestige). The later live only for today; the former will help you and your progeny live forever.

Something like von Neumann probes, or replicating assemblers, would spread from one celestial body to the next, making copies of themselves from the raw materials present, as well as breaking down these raw materials to create the 'tubes of nano-computers' which has the potential to contain more computing power than that of our own electro-chemical brains (as Kurzweil explained).
<br>

It's about breaking down matter into nano-blocks that can be assembled intelligently to produce distributed intelligence, again, in whatever form is available at that time (3D computation -&gt; optical computing -&gt; quantum computing -&gt; nano-computers a.k.a. rod-logic computing -&gt; [enter next computing paradigm here] ).

interesting to note that this is the turning period of those simulations. It is very likely that someone with a christian vein in his research creates a simulated environment to test out a human intellegent agent and goes ahead and name the agent adam and the environment eden. it bound to happen. 
<br>
<br>
the weird part is that it can be said that it was true and our ideas of time start to really break down.
<br>
<br>
to build a simple simulation with one or two high end agents working in a small environment will be posible in 5-50 years, and I'm being generous with 50.

We will have become gods in every conceivable way with the abilities to create universes, life, manipulate time, etc.
<br>
One thought is pressing then: Could it be that this already has happened? Maybe we already are living in a universe created by a post singular being. And maybe this being was/is our own offspring melding together in one supreme being and going back in time to create the universe (should I write this with Capital letters?) Circle round....
<br>
Another thought considering the many worlds interpretation: We can think in our mind of worlds that can't exist in our reality. Fantasyworlds, alternate worlds, fayrie tale worlds, etc. A god thinking could be producing such worlds only by speaking about them....
<br>
Only speculating! ;-)

When all the intelligent questions have been answered, all life will come back to Why am I here? What is the nature of the universe?
<br>
<br>
In seeking out this answer, I believe that the highest forms of intelligence will have to consume and become the universe. Through permeation, it will have insight into itself and all that itself (the universe) contains.

What does one know better than themselves?
<br>
<br>
Whether it will be active or not will be another story, perhaps it simply will add the ability to impress it's will on all substance. Will it understand any other intelligent life anymore? Likely not, it will be too many backward steps into it's evolution.

<br>
"od is all around us, in everything we touch." we have heard from various religions for centuries. Maybe that is the answer.

If a superintelligence wants to find the origin of the universe's existence why wouldnt it be able to?

Consider the impeccable order of the star systems and the rotation of galaxies. There is not sufficient evidence to explain these phenomena (except the ever-controversial theories of dark matter and energy), so universal intelligence is not only a possibility, but also a high probability. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I happen to think that Kurzweil is way out of his
<br>
league here when he talks about intelligence
<br>
taking over all of the matter in the universe,
<br>
manipulating space and time, etc. 
<br>
<br>
It is indeed quite possible, though not yet certain, that some form(s) of nanotechnology could be based on self replicating molecules such as DNA (perhaps modified forms of DNA, or
<br>
some other molecular structure) which could
<br>
have the viability of life in expanding throughout
<br>
this and other planetary systems, causing
<br>
transformations as they go, just as life has
<br>
here. But the laws of thermodynamics, gravity,
<br>
etc., must be accomodated in the process; they
<br>
can not be changed at will. In particular, the
<br>
first and second laws of thermodynamics: the
<br>
conservation of energy, and the nondecrease of
<br>
entropy; the speed limit on direct travel through space set by special relativity (the speed of
<br>
light); the law of gravitation and general
<br>
relativity etc. etc. set important limits on how
<br>
far any intelligence or technology can go in
<br>
manipulating nature. 
<br>
<br>
Indeed, the second law of thermodynamics points to the possibility of something known as the "classical heat death" of the universe - temperatures tend to equalize when hot and cold come into contact and in a closed static universe everything must eventually come to the same temperature, at which point no further change is possible. Of course, we don't live in a closed,
<br>
static universe (or a classical one; nature is
<br>
quantum mechanical) so this scenario is more of a
<br>
thought experiment than reality. 
<br>
<br>
However, recent observations have provided strong evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating with distant regions accelerating
<br>
away from each other and losing casual (light cone) contact at an accelerating rate. This accelerating expansion makes a mockery of any claim that a single intelligent force could influence all matter in the universe, or that all matter could be connected together in a single networked intelligence. 
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, an intriguing speculation was made in an earlier post. Current inflationary
<br>
cosmological models do strongly imply that this
<br>
universe is just one of a very large (perhaps
<br>
infinite) number of universes that are constantly
<br>
being born. Perhaps in some distant future, when
<br>
much, much more is understood about quantum gravity, string theory, inflationary cosmology etc., it could be possible for our (evolutionary) descendants to create other universes, perhaps even to design them (wholly or partially)according to predetermined specifications and/or
<br>
to leave this universe and go to one that has
<br>
been created. This sort of scenario could provide a neat explanation for why we see no evidence of other intelligences in our universe - they have packed up and left for more auspicious places. However, it should be emphasized that at the present time we don't have anywhere near the
<br>
understanding needed to evaluate such scenarios,
<br>
and that there is no real evidence for it - just
<br>
speculation.
<br>
<br>
In any case, none of this has any relevance to
<br>
our near future or the next major transformation
<br>
here on Earth: the singularity which Kurzweil has
<br>
so elegantly expounded upon. We would do better
<br>
to focus on that.</p></td>

<br>
What a great way of looking at it. Lets take, for example, the doomsday scenario of using nanotechnology to produce spores that can a) reproduce and b) carry enough botulism to kill every human on earth:
<br>
<br>
&#8220;Molecular manufacturing raises the possibility of horrifically effective weapons. As an example, the smallest insect is about 200 microns; this creates a plausible size estimate for a nanotech-built antipersonnel weapon capable of seeking and injecting toxin into unprotected humans. The human lethal dose of botulism toxin is about 100 nanograms, or about 1/100 the volume of the weapon. As many as 50 billion toxin-carrying devices&#8212;theoretically enough to kill every human on earth&#8212;could be packed into a single suitcase.&#8221; (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613223813/http://crnano.org/dangers.htm)" target="_blank">http://crnano.org/dangers.htm)</a>
<br>
<br>
This is terrorism to the N&#8217;th degree, but as you stated, is a scenario which involves today&#8217;s biggest fear, especially here in America, of terrorism.
<br>
<br>
I would like to see some research to support this argument, but I believe your quote hits the mark, and I hope our civilization will be able to survive accelerating technology, especially nanotechnology which will impact every facet of our lives, good or bad. Not to mention, Molecular Nanotechnology and &#8216;nano-factories&#8217; are on our doorstep.

This might make you wonder where I stand when it comes to Biblical God, and frankly after decades of searching (and I'm not that old), and studying math to the point where it became a religion for me, I have actually come to relization that I feel better believing in Biblical God, and that this "theory" (or belief) provides better answers for really deep questions that math does...

I never made the claim that our progress is counter to God's plan (I was just answering to someone who made that claim on my behalf by, like you, misunderstanding what I said). If anything Bible says something to the contrary actually. 
<br>
My main argument was that if we somehow spawned inteligent nano-machines or whatever that afterwards keep perfecting themselves at a fast rate and start getting more and more inteligent ad infinitum, and converting all matter in the universe to be "smart", where does that leave us? Soon enough (at least for those of us who would refuse to be modified by that smart matter) we'd be the dummest matter in the universe.
<br>
<br>
Some other poster said that we'd be so smart that we would be Gods. To which I said his statement presumes that something like God (whatever that may be, yet another term we don't have a working definition for. However assuming we come from similar cultural backgrounds when we say God we probably think something like Biblical God what ever that itself may be) can exist. And if so, why isn't it more likely that Biblical (or some other God) doesn't already exist? My claim is if we assume that God can exist (like that poster presumed) then it is far more likely that Biblical God already exists than it is likely for us to become one. Please do not draw more false conclusions from this. This statement only expresses what I think about the claims in the original article.

The "plan" I saw in a vision includes and requires humanity growing up and becoming "as gods".   It requires us growing up enough to not only create the technology but so change ourselves and our institutions to be able to use the technology to produce heaven on earth instead of hell.  The technology will fully enable either one.   In the vision the technology is a great gift and a great test of the human race.  We will not pass the test if we attempt to bury this talent until God returns.  Do you think God would create conscious reasoning creatures that have a complete roof on their development?   If we are not to develop more fully then why give us the capacity to start with?

<br>
<br>
We don't yet have the theory to answer really deep questions, we can't even scratch the surface, we are so primitive in our understanding that it is painful. So intuition and feelings guided tangentally by logic applied to those problems can make us somewhat less contempt with where we are in our evolution. 
<br>
<br>
Of course feeling yor way through something mundane and simple as calculus is plain silly, but wait till you are faced with really tough questions.

Luckily most people never do think about them, happily going through life, concentrating on "making a living". They are probably happier then those of us on the quest...

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Of course current human level intellects playing only with current human notions of logic and mathematics can actually comprehend but a little.  This is no big surprise.  There is not only the limitations of tools to consider.  Human minds have tight limits of what they can process.  All of us who are bright run into those limits often and early enough.  
<br>
<br>
We will not have the theory without augmenting our minds and expanding the range and variety of our tools.  Some things may not be comprehensible even with serious augmentation without stepping outside some of our evolutionary heritage.  Even highly evolved apes bred to the savannah and small tribe are likely to miss muuch their deep programming does not see or misinterprets.   
<br>
<br>
Increasingly it is in our power to augment our mentation, to build new intelligences free of some of our programming  and eventually we will know how to get beyond some of our programming.  A lot of spiritual practice is about overcoming some of that same programming.  
<br>
<br>
Some of us decided to perhaps be less "happy" but less ignorant than others.  But then we run smack into how ignorant we really are.  Ignorant but not hopeless.  We may be just smart enough to overcome our limitations.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think a mistake Kurzweil and others are making here is to talk about this new intelligence as "ours", and to say "we" will extend our intelligence. The mind of this new intelligence will be very much outside of our own. We will not share in its experiences. The best we can hope for is to be one of the few people (if any) lucky enough to be in a privileged position that allows us to be given a few crumbs of whatever insights it may have. As someone who has not thought about this as much as Kurzweil has, I'm really curious to know if I'm wrong and he has thought this through and has a good rationale for using the words "we" and "our" when talking about this intelligence. Those words also imply some measure of control, as if we would have any control over such an intelligence, which seems to me like a pretty outrageous assumption to make.
<br>
<br>
If by "we" Kurzweil means humanity, I think this is a misleading and mistaken view. The intelligence will arise not from some unified effort of all humanity, but rather secretly inside some research lab of a large organization such as a company. IBM, Microsoft, and Google come to mind. It may be months or even years before the existence of the intelligence is revealed to the world. Also this scenario is entirely consistent with the idea that the first intelligence will emerge in the Internet, because large organizations like those can easily harness the power of the Internet, or large subsets of it, through initiatives such as grid computing (IBM), Google Compute (Google) or .NET (Microsoft). But that is not the only path to success: they could just use the Internet as a data source for learning; they should have enough money to buy plenty of units of computing power at whatever the price happens to be at the time. When intelligence is built or emerges within one of these organizations, that does not represent something "we" as humanity did, nor is it ours. It represents something that the organization that produced it did, and it is *theirs* (not ours) to do with what *they* (not we) want to. I make this point because of Kurzweil's specific and confusing use of the word "our" to describe this intelligence.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Would it not be wise to start with a definition of Universal Intelligence (with perhaps a subdef for the human variety?) And who says that all the described matter and energy is that dumb?
<br>
  I think we abound in arrogance in ascribing this intelligence as our own - did it not, after all, evolve with us? The implication, in my view, is that it existed before we did.
<br>
  The universe is calculated to be 13.7B or so years old.   Are we so vain as to believe that its been waiting all this time just for us to reach this particular stage of our development so it may hand us the reins?
<br>
  I rather like the posit that intelligence and survival are inexorably linked, but then, is death really non-survival? or does the soul simply take another step down (or up) on the stairwell of entropy?  Christianity teaches us that animals have no souls;  Just how fearfull of a being do you have to be to declare another living entity soulless?  Do they fear dogs could crowd us out of heaven if we allowed them equity?
<br>
  Arrogance and vanity are typically the characteristics of the fearfull, ignorant and insecure (my observation, that I have more than once seen in my own actions).
<br>
  All this harkens back to that wonderfull story of Crocodile Dundee's:  We are the fleas that argue about who owns that part of the dog that we inhabit, whereas we really belong to the dog . . .
<br>
  Do we create reality by imagination, or do we discover it?  And what is the true nature of language, after all?  To obfuscate, seduce, confuse, enlighten, condemn, enrapture.  Is language a friend or an enemy?  Like all tools, it is both. Bear in mind, at our root, we are toolmakers and users (as are a surprising number of our animal brethren).
<br>
  I suspect one day god will write on our species' tombstone: "They made workable tools"  I suspect (or rather hope) he makes tools as well. The idea of Black Holes as galaxial conversion tools is rather fascinating.
<br>
  Lets posit another (not so new) idea:  The aim of life is the survival of a species (be it on a Universal, Solar, planetary, microbial or sub-atomic scale)  Some species die and some survive.  All members of a species die sometime, but if too many die, the species becomes extinct.  Through evolution, the better their ability to adapt, the longer the species should survive.  Can these rules be applied to the universe?  It seems they may apply to galaxies, solar systems, right on down to the smallest lifeform imaginable. Fascinating idea that god might be fighting for his own survival, eh?
<br>
  Anyway,  in our experience as a species it has become apparent that toolmaking is a very usefull adjunct to survival.  Toolmaking seems to be enhanced by imagination and, ultimately, intelligence.  So, the age old question:  what comes first, the tool or the intelligence?  Lets define toolmaking for the moment as the ability to take something less usefull from the environment and turn it to a more usefull task.  
<br>
  Feel free to critise, I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.
<br>
  No matter what faculties employed, the aim is still to make better tools.  Is tool making possible without intelligence?  Did the development of a slime-trail for slugs happen completely by chance?  What factors pushed or favoured its occurrence?  Was local or distributed intelligence involved?  Could slugs have some infinitessimal intelligence?  Do they not also want to survive just as we do?  Its enough to say that they have survived, not so?
<br>
  Is it fair to say that one galaxy devouring another does so because it can, or that it must to survive?  Are galaxies really that dumb? and completely enslaved by their gravitional forces?
<br>
  And are they just waiting for our magical touch to blow full force intellect and self awareness into their huge but mundane existences?    </p></td>

Actually, no, it is not vain. It depends on how anthropically you interpret the evolution of the universe.
<br>
<br>
However, simply stated, the fact that the universe as we know it is not ruled by a superior alien fast-thinker implies two things 1) It just hasn't ever happened before. So, indeed, the universe is waiting. or 2) It isn't possible. In which case attempting to do so is not vain, although perhaps in vain. ;)</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Mr. Kurzweil&#8217;s insights are a welcome breath of fresh air!  He has finally managed to bring Eastern thought in complete contact with Western science.  Although others, notably Fritjof Capra, have written about parallels between quantum physics and Eastern philosophies, this is truly a significant development, in the acknowledgement in the understanding of the &#8220;organic&#8221; nature of the universe.
<br>
<br>
I have several concerns, dealing with the &#8220;Western&#8221; approach to the intelligence that Kurzweil describes.  I agree that in the not-too-distant future our intelligence will far outstrip anything that we can conceive of.  As a culture, and a planet, there appears to be very little discussion about the potentials involved.  We barely have experience with individuals having an IQ of over 200 (The poet Goethe, with a considered IQ of 210, is considered the most &#8220;intelligent&#8221; man to have lived.)  How will we deal with the &#8220;super intelligent&#8221; who will, at first, be as strangers in a strange land?  How will our own definition of intelligence and who we are change?
<br>
<br>
But more importantly, it appears, from an Eastern philosophical point of view that Kurzweil&#8217;s view is based on an &#8220;upside-down&#8221; assumption of how the universe is &#8220;constructed&#8221;.  Most Eastern philosophies hold consciousness to be the primary foundation of existence, and that our form of intelligence is a rather low-level, subsidiary phenomenon.  In light of that view, perhaps, yes, our exponential expansion of intellect may have effects that we can vaguely perceive, as has Mr. Kurzweil.  However, we may also see that our relations with higher aspects of &#8220;universal&#8221; (for lack of a better word) intelligence may have some interesting, and completely unforeseen consequences, as &#8220;out there&#8221; may not be as empty and &#8220;dumb&#8221; as the good author supposes.  The universe may have some &#8220;ideas&#8221; of its own..
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is time to explore some of those possible consequences and the range of responses that we personally, and as societies and cultures, may have to the new worlds before us.

<br>
The claim that the rovers "found a way" to increase their power is blatantly silly: The rovers did not use intelligence to discover a method to revitalize their solar cells. Rather, the (marginal) increase was due merely to the wind cleaning some of the dust off of their solar cells. And the power output of their solar cells is still lower than it had been when the probes first landed. In other words: The degradation in conversion efficiency was PARTIALLY reversed.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>i think intelligence is really poorly defined in this article.  just what exactly is supposed to be permeating all matter and energy?
<br>
<br>
i don't even usually speak in terms of matter and energy because it implies there is a difference between the two; that matter is some dumb stuff and energy is what moves that stuff around.  but reality, as it exists outside of our textbooks and conversations, is really just a patterning.  we havent found "stuff" yet.  and there is no reason, in fact, for there to be any stuff.  so just what is it we are trying to control by bringing the singularity about?
<br>
<br>
it seems obvious to me that the whole of existence and the universe itself is innately conscious and intelligent already.  surely, as a scientist this fellow realizes that we grew out of the earth along with every other form of "life" that we see on this planet. (unless you subscribe to a philosophy that advocates you were brought into existence by a god or divine force of some kind and then placed on a planet that it made for you to inhabit)  therefore, by default, we know that the universe is already intelligent.
<br>
<br>
it's similar to the lilac tree in my back yard.  it grows lilac flowers...that is simply what it does.  the flower is the most complex feature of the whole bush in terms of physical structure, function, and visual appeal, but the flowers don't have anything to them that the bush didn't make for them.  we are the most complex thing we have encountered in the universe so far but we don't have anything that the universe didn't have from the strat.  and what's more, the lilac bush (our universe) will never randomly grow oranges (accidently create intelligence).  you don't get oranges out of a lilac bush, and you don't get intelligent beings out of an unintelligent universe.
<br>
<br>
intelligence has already permeated the whole universe (and probably set it into motion).  the whole talk of ending pain and undifferentiating each one of us into a collective singularity sounds more like it would stop existence altogether.  how would you know pleasure without pain?  without the extremes of pleasure and pain you couldn't even experience the neutral state, when you are neither in pleasure nor pain but simply well and fine.  let's say we do achieve a singularity and control everything and know everything and become, for all purposes, divine existence itself.  then what?  i think it should be rather boring being a god in this sense.  where's the fun in that?  the first thing i would do to entertain myself if i achieved the singularity would probably be to split myself into an infinitude of different things like hydrogen, rocks, trees, birds, beetles, and people that have  conversations on internet forums...</p></td>

Frank Tipler and Hans Moravec have dealt with the notion of "intelligence" permeating the cosmos, using space probes at slow to relativistic speeds, and, in Tipler's case; manuvering the Univese, over eons, into an omega point.

Yes I feel it still does mean something, in the manner that many people are content with watching sports (as I do at times) rather then cogitate about a possible trans-human condition as we all like to do on Mind-X. 
<br>
<br>
Since Zizzi is a person of letters, an astrophysicist. I strongly suspect that his analysis of the cosmos is more educated and therefore, more profound then mine. For example, Zizzi has published papers in peer-reviewed science journals, and I never have. I can read what he writes, but cannot contribute to the knowledge-base itself.
<br>
<br>
Thus, I would term Zizzi or somebody like him, a thinker, rather than myself, or Joe Sixpack down the street, who can only draw inspiration from such thinkers.

Your standards must be very high indeed to qualify for outstanding thinking. So to be a "thinker" one, seemingly must change the world, result-wise? Or, can you cite an example(s) of people who would qualify for your "thinker" criteria, and those that would not? Are you just confining such results to technology and science?

But programs like SETI work on the assumption that alien comunication systems are either equal to or only slightly superior to terrestrial communication.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The notion of intelligence permeating the cosmos is not a new supposition. In fact, it is probably as old as even thought itself. The problem only arises when the thoughts that guide this thinking seek to prove the validity of themselves through science. Science is what we consider fact, but many things that cannot be proved using current methods and yet have no logical fallacies could in fact be true. Such as it may be with our understanding of intelligences and the laws that guide our universe. 
<br>
<br>
There could be an underlying law that we have not yet discovered that guides all, yet we only have begun to explain the patterns caused by this law using science and mathematics. This law could have something to do with intelligences being the guiding force of all, but until someone formulates  an equation that relates this relationship, our feeble human minds will never accept it as absolute truth and will therefore still be in the dark and powerless to change.   </p></td>
