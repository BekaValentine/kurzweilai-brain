<div class="TeaserText">For Hans Moravec, our natural senses will swiftly become obsolete, as brain to computer interfaces become more common. Our physical environment will change as well, into what he calls a "densely connected cyberspace." Do our senses serve just to exchange information? </div>

<br><p>Originally published in the in Proceedings of Der Sinn der Sinne International Congress, Kunst und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Bonn, Germany, February 2, 1997 (original article can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011141953/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1997/970128.nosense.html" target="_new">here</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2001.</p><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Senses evolved to when the world was wild, enabling our ancestors to detect subtle passing opportunities and dangers. Senses are less useful in a tamer world, where our interactions become more and more simple <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> exchanges. Senses, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>s using them, are increasingly liabilities, demanding entertainment rather than providing useful services. The anachronism will become more apparent as virtual realities, prosthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organs and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s become common. Imagine reading a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen if your eyes and visual cortex are artificial prostheses. It would be far better to bypass all the sensory processing, and insert the message from the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> directly into the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> portions of your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. In such manner all our senses will become obsolete, as our physical environment is inexorably refined from a rough physical place into a densely interconnected <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> is a transparent, paper-thin layer of <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> tissue at the back of the eyeball--on which the eye's lens projects an image of the world--connected by a million-fiber cable--the optic <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a>--to regions deep in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. It is a part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> convenient for study, even in living <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s because of its peripheral location and because its image-processing functions seem straightforward compared with the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s other mysteries. A <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> contains about 100 million <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, of five distinct kinds. <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a>-sensitive cells feed <i>horizontal</i> cells and <i>bipolar</i> cells, which connect to <i>amacrine</i> cells, whose output goes to <i>ganglion</i> cells, whose outgoing fibers bundle to form the optic <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a>. Each of the million ganglion-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> axons carries signals from a particular patch of image, representing the differences in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> intensity between adjacent regions and from one <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to the next--edge and motion detections that are useful also in <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> vision. Overall, the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> seems to resolve about one million distinct regions in the visual field and to follow change up to about ten frames per second. Fed a video image with similar resolution, it takes a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> vision <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> about 100 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> operations to produce a single edge or motion detection, thus 100 million operations to match a whole "frame" of optic <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> output, and 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>--the power of a small <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>--to equal the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>'s ten frames per second.</p>
<p>If the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> is worth 1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>, what about the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, whose larger <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are 1,000 times as numerous, but occupy 100,000 times the volume? Multiplying the <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> by a compromise <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a> ratio of 10,000 yields a rough <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> equivalent of 10 million <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>--like a million 1997 <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, or 100 of the biggest <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s. Conversely a 10 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>--like most still in use--has the mental power of a million-<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> bee. An advanced experimental <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>, with 100 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>, matches the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of a very small fish. The Figure 2 rates other entities. In fact, the narrowly competent performace of advanced industrial robots that do intricate assembly of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, and of experimental robots that drive the autobahns, has the character of a small <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>. Technological development has taken us from the equivalent of single <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s to this stage in about 70 years. It took natural <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> about 700 million years to go as far - evolving humans from there required a few hundred million more. By <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> it should take <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> a few decades to cover the remaining distance. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> supports this timescale.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s have doubled in capacity every two years since 1950, a pace that has becom an industry given. The curve steepened in the 1990s, to doubling each year, as seen in Figure 2. The universal factor in improving <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> has been <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>: smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s have less inertia and operate more quickly with less power, and more of them can exist in a given <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">Microprocessor</a>s in 1997 contain about 10 million <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, but manufacturers have exhibited <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> chips with a billion <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. As <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s shrink to atomic scales, it is possible to imagine two-dimensional chips with a trillion <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, and three-dimensional arrays with a million trillion. Such numbers take us far beyond the paltry 10 million <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> required for a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-capable <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. The--probably conservative--assumption that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power will continue to grow at its historical rate predicts that 10 million <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s will arrive by 2030. Giving the <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> industry a few years to get its <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> into shape, suggests the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like robots soon after.</p>
<p>As intelligent robots design successive generations of successors, technical <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> will go into overdrive. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> humans can either adopt the fabulous mechanisms of robots, thus becoming robots themselves, or they can retire into obscurity. A <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> will colonize <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> with intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s optimized to live there. Yet, viewed from a distance, <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> expansion into the cosmos will be a vigorous physical affair, a wavefront that converts raw inanimate <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> into mechanisms for further expansion. It will leave in its ever-growing wake a more subtle world, with less <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> and more <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>.</p>
<p>On the frontier, robots of ever increasing mental and physical ability will compete with one another in a boundless land rush. Behind the expansion wavefront, a surround of established neighbors will restrain <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, and the contest will become one of boundary pressure, infiltration and persuasion: a battle of wits. A <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with superior <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> may encroach on a neighbor's <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> through force, threat, or convincing promises about the benefits of merger. A <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> with superior models of mind might lace attractive gifts of useful <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> with subtle slants that subvert others to its purposes. Almost always, the more powerful minds will have the advantage.</p>
<p>To stay competitive, robots will have to grow in place, repeatedly restructuring the stuff of their bounded bodies into more refined and effective forms. Inert lumps of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, along with limbs and <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organs, will be converted into computing <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, whose <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s will be then miniaturized to increase their number and speed. Physical activity will gradually transform itself into a web of increasingly pure <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, where every smallest <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> is a meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. We cannot guess the mechanisms robots will use, since physical theory has not yet found even the exact rules underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Having found the rules, robots may use their prodigious minds to devise highly improbable organizations that are to familiar <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s as knitted sweaters are to tangled balls of yarn.</p>
<p>As they arrange <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> into forms best for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, robots will use mathematical insights to optimize and compress the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s themselves. Every consequent increase in their mental powers will accelerate <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> gains, and the inhabited portions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> will be rapidly transformed into a <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, where overt physical activity is imperceptible, but the world inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is astronomically rich. Beings will cease to be defined by their physical geographic boundaries, but will establish, extend and defend identities as <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>al transactions in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>. The old bodies of individual robots, refined into matrices for <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, will interconnect, and the minds of robots, as pure <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, will migrate among them at will. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> becomes more potent, its advantage over physical bodies will overwhelm even on the raw expansion frontier. The <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> wavefront of coarse physical transformation will be overtaken by a faster <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> conversion, the whole becoming finally a bubble of Mind expanding at near lightspeed.</p><h1>State of Mind</h1><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> will be inhabited by transformed robots, moving and growing with a freedom impossible for physical entities. A good, or merely convincing, idea, or an entire personality, may spread to neighbors at the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. Boundaries of personal <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> will be very fluid, and ultimately arbitrary and subjective, as strong and weak interconnections between different regions rapidly form and dissolve. Yet some boundaries will persist, due to distance, incompatible ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, and deliberate choice. The consequent competitive <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> will allow a Darwinian <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> to continue, weeding out ineffective ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, and fostering a continuing novelty.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al speedups will extend the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> available to <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> inhabitants, because they cram more events into a given physical <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but will have only a subtle effect on immediate existence, since everything, inside and outside the individual, will be equally accelerated. Distant correspondents, however, will seem even more distant, since more <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s will transpire in the unaltered transit <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for lightspeed messages. Also, as <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage is made more efficient through both denser utilization of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and more efficient encodings, there will be increasingly more cyber-stuff between any two points. The overall effect of improvements in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al efficiency is to increase the effective <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and material available, that is, to expand the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>Because it uses resources more efficiently, a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> will be effectively <i>much</i> bigger and longer lasting than the raw spacetime it displaces. Only an infinitesimal fraction of normal <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> does work of interest to <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> beings, but in a well-developed <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> every <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> will be part of a relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> or storing a significant datum. The advantage will grow as more compact and faster ways of using <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> are invented. Today we take pride in storing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> as densely as one <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> per <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, but it is possible to do much better by converting an <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>'s mass into many low-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s, each storing a separate <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/photon_entry.html">photon</a>s' energies are reduced, more of them can be created, but their wavelength, and thus the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> they occupy and the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> them rises, while the temperature they can tolerate drops. A very general quantum mechanical calculation in this <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> by Bekenstein concludes that the maximum amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> stored in (or fully describing) a sphere of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is proportional to the mass of the sphere times its radius, hugely scaled. The "Bekenstein bound" leaves room for a million bits in a <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, 10<sup>16</sup> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>, 10<sup>45</sup> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being, 10<sup>75</sup> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>, 10<sup>86</sup> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>, 10<sup>106</sup> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>, and 10<sup>122</sup> in the visible <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> comparison above suggests that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> could be encoded in less than 10<sup>15</sup> bits. If it takes a thousand times more storage to encode a body and surrounding environment, a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> with living <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> might consume 10<sup>18</sup> bits, and a large city of a million <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-scale inhabitants might be efficiently stored in 10<sup>24</sup> bits, and the entire existing world population would fit in 10<sup>28</sup>. Thus, in an ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, the 10<sup>45</sup> bits of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body could contain the efficiently-encoded biospheres of a thousand galaxies--or a quadrillion individuals each with a quadrillion times the capacity of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind.</p>
<p>Because it will be so more capacious than the conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> it displaces, the expanding bubble of <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> can easily recreate internally everything of interest it encounters, memorizing the old <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> as it consumes it. Traveling as fast as any warning message, it will absorb astronomical oddities, geologic wonders, ancient Voyager spacecraft, early robots in outbound starships and entire alien biospheres. Those entities may continue to live and grow as if nothing had happened, oblivious of their new status as simulations in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>--living memories in unimaginably powerful minds, more secure in their existence, and with more <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> than ever before, because they have become valued parts of such powerful patrons.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, at the center of the expansion, can hardly escape the transformation. The conservative, somewhat backward, robots defending <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> from unpredictable robots will be helpless against a <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> that subverts their very substance. Perhaps they will continue, as simulations defending a simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> of simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humans--in one of many, many different stories that plays itself out in the vast and fertile minds of our ethereal grandchildren.</p>
<p>The scenarios absorbed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> expansion will provide not only starting points for unimaginably many tales about possible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s, but an astronomically voluminous archeological record from which to infer the past. Minds somewhere intermediate between Sherlock Holmes and <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> will process clues in solar-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> quantities to deduce and recreate the most microscopic details of the preceding eras. Entire world histories, with all their living, feeling inhabitants, will be resurrected in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>. Geologic ages, historical periods and individual lifetimes will recur again and again as parts of larger mental efforts, in faithful renditions, in artistic variations, and in completely fictionalized forms.</p>
<p>The Minds will be so vast and enduring, that rare infinitesimal flickers of interest by them in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> past will ensure that our entire <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is replayed astronomically many times, in many places and many, many variations. Single original events will be very rare compared to the indefinitely many <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> replays. Most things that are experienced--this very moment, for instance, or your entire <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>--are far more likely to be a Mind's musings than the physical processes they seem to be. There is no way to tell for sure, and the suspicion that we are someone else's <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> does not free us from the burdens of life: to a simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>, the simulation is reality, and must be lived by its internal rules.</p><h1>Pigs in <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">Cyberspace</a>?</h1><p>Might an adventurous <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind escape from a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> role in a cyber deity's <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s, to eke out an independent <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> among the mental behemoths of a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>? We approach the question by extrapolating existing possibilities.</p>
<p>Telepresence and <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> are in the news. Today's pioneering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s give crude peeks into remote and simulated worlds, but maturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will improve the fidelity. Imagine a well-developed version of the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>: you are cocooned in a harness that, with optical, acoustical, mechanical, chemical and electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s drives all your senses, and measures all of your <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry presents pictures to your eyes, sounds to your ears, pressures and temperatures to your skin, forces to your muscles and even smells and tastes to your nose and mouth. Telepresence results when these inputs and outputs are relayed to a distant <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. Images from the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>'s two camera eyes appear on your eyeglass viewscreens, sound from its microphones is heard in your earphones, contacts on your skin allow you to feel through its <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ed surface and smell and taste through its chemical sensors. Motions of your body cause the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> to move in exact synchrony. When you reach for something in the viewscreens, the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> grasps it, and relays to your muscles and skin the resulting weight, shape, texture and temperature, creating the perfect illusion that you inhabit the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>'s body. Your <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> seems to have migrated to the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>'s location, in a true "out of body" experience.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> uses a telepresence harness, but substitutes a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation for the remote <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>. When connected to a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, where you are and what you see and touch do not exist in the usual physical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, but are a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-generated <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>. Like <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> dreams, virtual realities may contain <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s from the outside world, for instance representations of other physical people connected via their own harnesses, or even real views, perhaps through simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a>. Imagine a hybrid travel <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, where a virtual "central station" is surrounded by <a class="thought" href="entries/portal_entry.html">portal</a>s with views of various physical locations. While in the station one inhabits a simulated body, but as one steps through a <a class="thought" href="entries/portal_entry.html">portal</a>, the harness link <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es seamlessly to a physical telepresence <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> waiting at that location.</p>
<p>Linked realities are crude toys today, but driven by rapidly advancing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s technologies. In a few decades people may spend more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> linked than experiencing their dull immediate surroundings, just as today most of us spend more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in artificial indoor settings than in the uncomfortable outdoors. Linked realities will routinely transcend the physical and sensory limitations of the "home" body. As those limitations become more severe with age, we might compensate by turning up a kind of volume control, as with a hearing aid. When hearing aids at any volume are insufficient, it is now possible to install <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>s that stimulate auditory nerves directly. Similarly, on a grander scale, aging users of remote bodies may opt to bypass atrophied muscles and dimmed senses, and connect sensory and motor nerves directly to <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s. Direct neural <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s would make most of the harness <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> unnecessary, along with <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organs and muscles, and indeed the bulk of the body. The home body might be lost, but remote and virtual experiences could become more real than ever.</p>
<p>Picture a "<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> in a vat," sustained by <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-support <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, connected by wonderful <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> links to a series of artificial rent-a-bodies in remote locations, and to simulated bodies in virtual realities. Though it may be nudged far beyond its natural lifespan by an optimal physical environment, a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> built to operate for a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> lifetime is unlikely to function effectively forever. Why not use advanced neurological <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s like that which links it with the external world, to replace the gray <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> as it begins to fail? <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">Bit</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> our failing <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> may be replaced by superior <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> equivalents, leaving our personality and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s clearer than ever, though, in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, no vestige of our original body or <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> remains. The vat, like the harness before it, will have been rendered obsolete, while our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and awareness continue. Our mind will have been transplanted from our original <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> into artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. Transplantation to yet other <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> should be trivial in comparison. Like <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> that can be transferred between <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s without disrupting the processes they represent, our essences will become patterns that can migrate the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s at will. <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> will be more flexible--when our mind resides in very fast <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, one second of real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> may provide a subjective year of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, while a thousand years spent on a passive storage medium will seem like no <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at all. The very <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of our minds will follow our <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of awareness in shifting from place to place at the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. We might find ourselves distributed over many locations, one piece of our mind here, another piece there, and our <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of awareness yet elsewhere, in what can no longer be called an out-of-body experience, for lack of a body to be out of. And, yet, we will not be truly disembodied minds.</p>
<p>Humans need a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of body. After twelve hours in a sensory-deprivation tank, floating in a totally dark, quiet, contactless, odorless, tasteless, body-temperature saline solution, a person begins to hallucinate, as the mind, like a television displaying snow on an empty channel, turns up the amplification in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> of a signal, becoming ever less discriminating in the interpretations it makes of random sensory hiss. To remain sane, a transplanted mind will require a consistent sensory and motor image, derived from a body, or from a simulation. Transplanted <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> minds will often be without physical bodies, but hardly ever without the illusion of having them.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s already contain many non-<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> entities that resemble truly bodiless minds. A typical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> knows nothing about physical <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> pieces or chessboards, or about the staring eyes of its opponent or the bright lights of a tournament, nor does it work with an internal simulation of those physical <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s. It <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s, instead, with a very efficient and compact mathematical representation of <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> positions and moves. For the benefit of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> players, this internal representation may be interpreted into a graphic on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen, but such images mean nothing to the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that actually chooses the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> moves. The <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and sensations--its <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>--is pure <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, uncomplicated by physical considerations. Unlike a transplanted <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind requiring a simulated body, a <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is pure mind.</p>
<p>Minds in a mature, teeming, competitive <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a> will be optimally configured to make their living there. Only successful enterprises will be able to afford the storage and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al essentials of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Some may do the equivalent of construction, converting undeveloped parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>, or improving the performance of existing patches, thus creating new wealth. Others may devise mathematical, physical or <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering solutions that give the developers new and better ways to construct computing capacity. Some may create <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that others can incorporate into mental repertoire. There will be niches for agents, who collect commissions for locating opportunities and negotiating deals for clients, and for banks, storing and redistributing resources, buying and selling computing <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Some mental creations will be like <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, having value only because of changeable idiosyncrasies in their customers. Entities who fail to support their operating costs will eventually shrink and disappear, or merge with other ventures. Those who succeed will grow. The closest present-day parallel is the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, fragmentation and consolidation of corporations, who plan their <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, but whose options are shaped primarily by the marketplace.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> would likely fare poorly in such a <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>. Unlike the streamlined <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>s that zip about, making discoveries and deals, rapidly reconfiguring themselves to efficiently handle changing <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind would lumber about in a massively inappropriate body simulation, like a deep-sea diver plodding through a troupe of acrobatic dolphins. Every interaction with the world would first be <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ized into a recognizable quasi-physical form: other <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s might be presented as <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, plants or demons, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> items as books or treasure chests, accounting entries as coins or gold. Maintaining the fictions will increase the cost of doing business and decrease responsiveness, as will operating the mind <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry that reduces the physical simulations into mental <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind. Though a few humans may find momentary niches exploiting their baroque construction to produce <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-flavored <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, most will be compelled to streamline their <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>.</p>
<p>The streamlining could begin by merging processes that <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ize the world with those that reduce the resulting simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> impressions. The cyber world would still appear as location, color, smell, faces, and so on, but only noticed details would be represented. Since physical <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>s are probably not the best way to deal with most <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, humans would still be at a disadvantage to optimized <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>s. Viability might be further increased by replacing some innermost mental processes with <a class="thought" href="entries/cyberspace_entry.html">cyberspace</a>-appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s purchased from the AIs. By a large number of such substitutions, our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> procedures might be totally liberated from any traces of our original body. But the bodiless mind that results, wonderful though it may be in its clarity of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and breadth of understanding, would be hardly human: it will have become an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I greatly enjoyed this article, and though some points seemed somewhat fanciful I agree with the basic concepts of possible future technologies and where they will take us. Indeed, much of it seems unavoidable if given a long enough timeline, and I've noted several examples of how these kinds of technology are becoming more a part of the average persons daily life. I had a conversation with my grandmother last week (using an instant messenger) about nano tubes and smart materials. 
<br>
<br>
Why is it though, that while so many people share this vision of the future so few really seem to desire its realization? Ask anyone if they'd enjoy the ability to fly through a virtual world and they'll likely say yes, but when it comes to the actual methods it could be achieved with many of those same people take a different stance on the whole subject.
<br>
<br>
My point is that as we begin to realize the full potential of the technologies that we are trying to create, we should also be concerned with how the masses view these same possibilities. What is taken for granted as desirable or even inevitable by some could be seen as something to be avoided altogether by others. My personal belief is that most of these things will be realized someday, but their achievement could be made more difficult than necessary if we do not try to teach people that virtual reality and related future technologies will be some of the greatest tools mankind has ever had the privilege of working with.

Sure, flying through a virtual world sounds cool, but you don't need robots to do that.

That said, I absolutely love your final paragraph. Excellent points!

The purpose of flying is to make travel faster and more convenient -- otherwise we'd just take a car or train.  Having fun is a trivial pursuit.  It's enjoyable for a short period of time but not an end in itself.  You might find some people who feel that it is, just like the people who spend their time and money on porno sites.  But the majority of people can see what a dead end that is.  An endless journey to nowhere isn't much of a journey.  If all a person wants to do with his life is kill time, he can just commit suicide and kill it all at once.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
For example, (since I have just been thinking about the virtual simulation of cell growth) if you were a molecular biologist trying to understand specific processes in a cell, being able to enter into a simulation of the cell and to slow down its processes so that you could follow what was happening step by step would be a fascinating and positive experience.

<br>
While certain kinds of virtual reality may not appeal to you or I, I wouldn't be suprised if you had access to all possible virtual applications, that you wouldn't choose to experience some of them.

Grant, while you may find the pursuit of fun to be trivial, most do not. Your "serious endeavors" did not drive the advances in the internet any more than KurzweilAI did. Porn did. Entertainment in general, and sex in specific, has driven many (some say all, but I think the military should get some credit!) new technologies. There are still laws of economics - the money has to come from somewhere.
<br>
<br>
Ray wisely points out in his last book that ultimately, "virtual" worlds may offer you experiences even more vivid than are possible in the "real" world. Virtual flying and virtual sex may compare less favorably with the real thing today, but what about tomorrow?
<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the notion that entertainment is just "killing time" is silly. I imagine you do, too - unless you only believe in sex for procreation.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I guess I have about as much fun as anyone.  But I recognize that time spent doing it is a way of avoiding what I should be doing.  I am working on becoming a fiction writer.  I have four novels in the works and mountains of research I need to absorb in order to create a believable virtual world for my readers.  I also search the Internet for data on numerous subjects.  Most of that activity is work related.  What I don't want to do is become a computer couch potato.  I don't want to wind up spending most of my time in the pursuit of what's fun rather than the pursuit of what furthers my acquisition of knowledge.  
<br>
<br>
I used to watch movies and read books for the sheer pleasure of enjoying the story.  Now I analyze every story as I watch it in hopes of discovering a new technique or idea that I can use in my own work.  Even play has become work for me.  I was an avid chess player at one time, too.  Now I feel I don't have time to immerse myself in that world anymore.  
<br>
<br>
What it all boils down to, I guess, is time structure.  What you do with your time is the story of your life.  You could say it defines us.  We are what we do.  At one time I bought hundreds of computer programs and spent countless hours trying to overcome the huge learning curve to become proficient with each one.  Now I use maybe four or five of them on a daily basis.  The rest no longer have any place in my life.  
<br>
<br>
I suspect it will be the same with virtual reality.  But instead of just learning how to type arcane instructions into a keyboard, I will have to learn how to use goggles and gloves and speak the proper incantations to bring about the changes in a virtual world that I want.  All of that plus the installation and setup will constitute a huge investment of time and effort for something I only plan to play with.  I just don't think I can afford it.  Immortality is not so close that I can afford to waste that much of the few years of good health and vitality I have left.  </p></td>

Predominantly, I make 3D art and I play/write music, so i consider myself to be an graphic artist and a musician. But even though those titles do a lott to describe me to someone else, they fall short of saying who and what I really am, as a whole.
<br>
<br>
You say that you are to busy working to waste time playing, and that you're working on some  sci-fi novels. Now, while I in no way think that the genre is a waste of time, how can you say that writing fiction is not entertainment, for both you and your readers? There are many forms of entertainment, and a lot of them do involve thought and even learning. Virtual reality holds the potential to be the finest example of this in human history. 
<br>
<br>
Lastly, you commented on immortality and your desire to achieve it before it's too late. That kind of technology's development is a very large scale event, and while you may contribute to its creation in some small way, that is all any one person will likely be able to do. There's to many fields of science involved, to much capitol required and simply to much work to be done for one person to think that they can "make it happen" for themselves. I don't want to die, but I'm not under the false impression that I can do anything about it on my own. It's the interest and support of the masses that will make this happen for all of us.

What an excellent response.  What ever happened to the adage of death sitting on your shoulders? To extremes it motivates you, at the least, gives some perspective on LIFE and living.  I think mortality should give one strength, not fear and cowardice of living.  To quote a favorite musician of mine, "All I want is the chance to learn, to live, to die."  I think expectations are dangerous things when grounded in fantasy.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I smile as I read this article. I'm not surprised at Hans' ideas. I was his teacher in grade five in Montreal Canada. I remember the class being amazed when he brought in a robot he had built. While I was trying to teach him fractions, his mind was somewhere else. He was interesting then and still is. I can't separate the faculties invovled in the brain from the spiritual element. I don't mean religion but that unseen intangible part that makes me, me and Hans, Hans. Wouldn't life be bland without those individual differences that lie in a nonphysical part of a person? When somebody do we miss his/her brain? We miss the person, the love, sympathy, compassion, humor and so much else. I'm proud of my former student but this idea is much too far out, cold and uncomfortable. I would love to hear from Hans and try once again to (teach him his fractions.)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> I just read a most interesting book called "Survival of the Sickest" which may challenge such proposals. The author points out that we are in a continual symbiosis with bacteria and viruses that shape our evolution, to the degree that even our common diseases, such as diabetes, are the result of adaptive processes that occurred during extreme environmental changes in the past.
<br>
<br>
 Diabetes itself may have originated during an ice age, when people actually had to store more sugar and excrete more water from their systems to deal with freezing temperatures. Our bodies retained that as an adaptive memory, but now may respond as diabetes in a society where we continually eat too much sugar and fat. It is perhaps a "memory response" where cultures naturally ate more high carbs and fat to stay warm, but now has no functional use, and becomes a dread disease.
<br>
<br>
 OTOH, the "junk DNA" in our bodies are composed of DNA that closely resemble viruses. They seem to be DNA bits that are waiting for certain triggering processes that cause us to adapt to changes in our environment and perhaps specialize our habits in reaction to that environment.
<br>
<br>
 The viruses from the environmwent actually serve to "inform" the body, and the junk DNA goes into action providing clues for the body to produce antibodies to overcome the invasion.
<br>
<br>
 We actually maintain bits and pieces of DNA as "memory patterns" waiting for a signal that gives us new adaptive abilities.
<br>
<br>
 All of this is part of our sensory awareness and makes us truly alive. What we call consciousness may actually be the combination of all those evolutinary "memory patterns" of DNA that compose nearly half of our DNA structure.
<br>
<br>
 AI would have to develop a memory pattern equal to that before we could call it conscious or do the kind of things the article says.</p></td>
