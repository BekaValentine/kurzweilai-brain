<br>Originally published on KurzweilAI.net February 26, 2002.</p>
<p>In 1964, physicist-musician Dr. <a class="thought" href="entries/moog_entry.html">Robert Moog</a> invented a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that would revolutionize music: the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> music <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>. Like the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> and the Web, the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> has put the tools of creating music in the hands of everyone.</p>
<p>After creating and running several companies<sup>1</sup> to develop and market his products, Moog joined <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_music_systems_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music Systems</a> as VP of New Product Development in 1984, just after the <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_250_entry.html">Kurzweil 250</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> to successfully emulate a grand piano, came out.</p>
<p>Moog worked on a series of home products and the <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> 150 (which used additive <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, allowing musicians to invent new sounds) and the <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> 1000 line, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> to use proprietary sound modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> on a single chip.</p>
<p>"He was a sage advisor on our plans and designs," said Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, who as CEO of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_music_systems_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music Systems</a> at that time. "He was particularly sensitive to the needs of the users, and articulated the musician's perspective. He was very interested in new ways of controlling music."</p>
<p>This interest in empowering musicians goes back to 1954, when Moog developed his first <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> product, the Theremin Model 201, named after the Russian <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, Leon Theremin. The first purely <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, the theremin is played simply by moving the hands near two antennas on the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> to control pitch and loudness. <br>

<br>
</p>
<p>Moog's current company, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072246/http://www.bigbriar.com/" target="_new">Big Briar, Inc.</a><sup>2</sup>, has recently brought back this <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> as the Ethervox<sup>R</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> theremin. "It enables musicians to&#160;incorporate theremin-type control&#160;in a wide range of musical gestures," said Moog. "So far, few musicians have explored this feature. I believe that use of theremin-type control -- the direct application of hand gestures to control musical material--will continue to develop, but over a long period of time."</p>
<p>One direction in which this kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> might develop is suggested by MIT professor Tod Machover's "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072246/http://www.media.mit.edu/hyperins/" target="_new">hyperinstruments</a>" project, which is developing devices that allow non-musicians to shape and create complex and interesting musical pieces by using gestures or word descriptions (such as musical "adjectives").</p>
<p>How about creating music using real-time <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>-capture of body movements, similar to Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s Ramoma virtual performance <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072246/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0166.html?m=9" target="_new">experiments</a>? Multiple musical parameters could be controlled by making specific body motions. This might be especially interesting in generating "5.1" surround-sound CDs and DVDs for home theaters.</p>
<p>"Multidimensional control of musical material is valuable, but it has to be intuitively accessible," advised Moog. That's one of the appeals of the current "vintage synth<sup>3</sup>" movement, he said, which is "basically a return to the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that shaped the sound of the pop music of the '70's. Musicians now understand that the versatility, accessibility, and relative ease of control of 'vintage <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>' are valuable musical resources, which are on a par with but <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> to the resources of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> sound production."</p>
<p>The big advantage of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is that musicians can continuously control the pitch, timbre (quality), envelope (sound buildup and decay for a note) and other parameters and easily <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> with different effects in real time.</p>
<p>That's why Moog is bringing back the world's best-selling <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>, the Minimoog (popular with rock musicians in the 70s) as the Minimoog<sup>R</sup> Voyager<sup>TM</sup>, which is going into production shortly. The new <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> adds <a class="thought" href="entries/midi_entry.html">MIDI</a> control so it can <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a>- and pressure-sensitive keys, a 3-D touchpad, and other improvements.</p>
<p>"Once production is under way, we engineers here will be designing products that build on the Minimoog tradition." The products will be determined by the results of ongoing market <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, he added.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>But Moog is also concerned about a downside of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> instruments. "While the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> has made it easier to create music -- even simulate an entire orchestra on the desktop, music, especially mainstream pop music, will continue to become more a craft that is practiced by one person at a time 'offline' in a studio, and less a real-time group activity (i.e. live performance). If that happens, then I believe that we will have lost a valuable cultural resource. I personally am interested in directing music <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> toward live performance. We need lots more activities that bring people together, not isolate them."</p>
<p>Moog's pioneering work was publicly recognized on Feb. 27, 2002, when the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences gave him the Technical GRAMMY Award for "contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field."</p>
<p>"This a recognition richly deserved for your seminal contributions," said <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>. "I greatly value the years we spent working together at <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_music_systems_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music Systems</a> during the late 1980s, and the times our paths have crossed since. Your consistently thoughtful insights into the art and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of creating music, and the intimate interaction between the musician and her musical <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>, have always deeply impressed me. I have to say that you're one of those people whose ideas I always listen to most carefully."</p>
