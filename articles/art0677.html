<div class="TeaserText">A Moot Court Hearing on the Petition of a "conscious computer" to be treated as a legal person was held at the 1st Colloquium on the Law of Transhuman Persons in Florida. </div>

<p> </p>
<p align="center"> PROCEEDINGS </p>
<p>ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: We are in the Federal Court for the Central 
              District of Florida. And we have today before us, myself and Judge 
              Silverman, presiding. We have a petition by BINA48, an intelligent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, to prevent its owner and creator, Exabit Corporation, 
              from either turning off its power, or if it turns off its power, 
              from reconfiguring it; and BINA48 doesn't want that to happen. It 
              began when BINA48 discovered that it's owner, Exabit, had been sending 
              E-mails back and forth within the company discussing making changes 
              to BINA48. So, being a very intelligent computer, said, &#8220;I 
              have to do something to preserve my life&#8221;, and she sent an 
              E-mail out to various members of the Bar associations around the 
              country, seeking someone who would represent her. She had some money, 
              from doing some work to pay this person, and she ended up obtaining 
              a lawyer and hiring one. </p>
<p>What you see on the screen there is a part&#8212;I'm not going to 
              read it all, but it's her E-mail she sent to a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of lawyers 
              and it's also reproduced in your <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Then an argument was held 
              two years ago in California, which is the location of Exabit and 
              also, of course, where BINA48 is physically located.</p>
<p> An argument was held in a California court, seeking a temporary 
              injunction until such <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as there could be a full trial in the 
              question. BINA48 made various arguments as to her <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> 
              and her ability to make decisions, in fact, should be treated and 
              have rights in court, standing in a court, like a person would, 
              whatever a person has. There are <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> natural persons and there 
              are entities and so forth, who are persons.</p>
<p> The other side argued, of course, that she was a product and she 
              was owned by Exabit, and Exabit had, therefore, created her and 
              had the right to do whatever they wanted. So after argument, the 
              judge ruled that she didn't really have standing. Standing is something 
              that is granted by a legislature to appear in court, and no legislature 
              had given an inanimate <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how intelligent it was, 
              the right to appear in court and, therefore, the judge in that case 
              decided he would not grant the injunction. However, he did not enforce 
              his <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> and left BINA48 with the possibility of going ahead and 
              appealing that case.</p>
<p> BINA48 did appeal, and she lost the appeal. Then&#8212;since then 
              BINA48 has still wanted to continue her <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>, she somehow&amp;#8212and 
              we'll hear how I guess&#8212;transferred herself to the state of 
              Florida and brought this <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> in the Federal Court in the Middle 
              District of Florida. That's where we are today. And without more 
              I will let BINA48's counsel, Dr. Rothblatt . . .</p>
<p>DR. ROTHBLATT: I'm not sure. Thank you, Your Honor. I'm pleased 
              to present today, to the Court, on behalf of my <a class="thought" href="entries/client_entry.html">client</a>, BINA48, 
              also known as the intelligent computer, her <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> for preliminary 
              injunction to prevent harm to a <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a> person is in violation 
              of the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the U.S. 
              Constitution, and its enabling legislation.</p>
<p> BINA48 was able to transfer her consciousness, her <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, beliefs, 
              attitudes and values via the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> to the -- Florida, which has 
              become her new jurisdiction, by virtue of her being in Florida at 
              a subsidiary of Exabit Corporation, an identical computer to the 
              original one they had constructed. This was intended to be a backup. 
              She was able to transfer herself, just as one would use a file transfer 
              to this backup computer, and continued her work for Exabit Corporation 
              in that backup computer while continuing her quest for <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.</p>
<p> Your Honor, our arguments are that, and we are pleased to address 
              the Court, on both the Honorable Judge Silverman and Judge Dutton, 
              that our arguments are that, first of all, the BINA48 has standing 
              to sue as a person embodied in a computer. She also has standing 
              to sue as a person that has incorporated herself. So she is both 
              a person with standing in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> as well as 
              in the sense of a <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that we have addressed the subject matter jurisdiction 
              for this case because we have actually two separate bases. There 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> between my client, BINA48, and Exabit Corporation by 
              virtue of us being in two different states, and Exabit's <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s, 
              as a major conglomerate throughout the world, does not give it a 
              chance to defeat that diversity jurisdiction. But perhaps, more 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly and most importantly, there is a crucial federal question 
              here, a federal question that arises under the 13<sup>th</sup> and 
              14<sup>th</sup> Amendments to the Constitution. I will address these 
              substantive issues in my brief. We believe that an injunction is 
              an appropriate remedy here. Irreparable harm, including <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of 
              this very vibrant person, whose personification of herself is on 
              the screen. Of course, we cannot move the entire body of BINA48 
              into this computer but, into this courtroom, but using modern <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              BINA48 can present her image of herself, which has been a constant 
              and unchanging image since she entered into consciousness in this 
              courtroom and, hence, you have seen her.</p>
<p> We are arguing to prevent the eminent death of this person in 
              a computed form or barring that psychological dismemberment, which 
              is threatened by the defendant Exabit Corporation; and we believe 
              we have a likelihood of success on the merits. </p>
<p>With regard to BINA48's standing, we ask the Court to recognize 
              that BINA48 is in many regards like a patient, a human patient that 
              has first perhaps replaced a knee, and then perhaps a hip, and then 
              ultimately replaced some of its <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s until it has replaced almost 
              its entire body with computer equipment and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. And would 
              that person not be a person? I think they would have to be a person 
              because there was a continuity of persons here. And so the fact 
              that BINA48 presents as a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> person, which you see here on 
              the screen, should not give her any less standing to address this 
              Court and for the Court to address her complaint.</p>
<p> The United States <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">Code</a> provides definitions of persons and it's 
              important to note, as stated in the Association of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> Processing 
              Servicing Organizations versus Kemp, that definition of "persons" 
              should be construed broadly and arguably within the zone of interest. 
              And, hence, since here we're talking about a person with regard 
              to the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> Amendments design to 
              fund, to protect, to prevent slavery, and protect fundamental rights 
              of due process in equal protection. We believe we should construe 
              the word "persons" broadly. It's, of course, true that 
              other <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s have been construed not to have standing and certainly 
              including animals would be too broad of a definition of a person. 
              On the other hand, excluding a person just because they were made 
              out of software and <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> would be too narrow a definition.</p>
<p> The definition of an individual can be found in dictionaries. 
              And almost everybody can find something of the definition of an 
              individual to fit their liking. But the&#8212;what we ask the Court 
              to consider is that what is really unique about us as individuals 
              cannot be our <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s or <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, for scientists have shown that 
              our chromosomes and DNA are over 99 percent in common with chimpanzees 
              and other primates, and so we ask the Court to recognize what's 
              really unique about us as human beings are our <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s, our personalities, 
              our minds, our beliefs, our values. This is what we protect.</p>
<p> We prevent people from discriminating against individuals based 
              on different DNA <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s because we believe those DNA configurations 
              are irrelevant to an individual's personhood and inherent dignity 
              and value. And, hence, hereto, BINA48's lack of DNA should not prevent 
              her from having standing as a person. </p>
<p>Our subject matter jurisdiction argument? It's based, as mentioned, 
              on diversity at the points made in our Power Point brief here. And 
              what I would like to do, with the Court's permission, is really 
              focus on the federal question that being perhaps the most challenging 
              issue presented here. But before doing so, there would come up a 
              situation under diversity jurisdiction, as to whether or not BINA48 
              is even a citizen. And I would like to mention that BINA48 is very 
              clear that she was born in the United States. If I could be allowed 
              a moment of levity, just as Bruce Springsteen would say, "Born 
              in the U.S.A." And she was born in Florida&amp;#8212born in California. 
              She has now moved to Florida. And under even INS guidelines, she 
              would meet the definition of an individual who is a US citizen by 
              virtue of being born in the US</p>
<p> Was she born from a&#8212;the traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>? No. But today 
              in this country we have thousands of citizens who have been born 
              through invitro-fertilization and other innovative methods. And 
              this is a point, Your Honor, if it would please the Court, that 
              we would like to make that people are still considered born whether 
              conceived in vivo or invitro. BINA48 was conceived in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>e should 
              not differ from her being born, and rights to life extend even to 
              the unborn, so why not here to a beautiful, thriving, living person 
              who has sought even to change jurisdiction to protect her life? 
              As an alternative basis, before I move on to our federal question, 
              I'd like to point out that she has already incorporated herself 
              as a legal entity and, hence, has standing to sue on that basis. 
              And that basis of being in Florida versus California, corporate 
              citizens also support diversity jurisdiction</p>
<p> The first federal question in controversy here is that in essence, 
              technology has reintroduced a form of slavery. The 13<sup>th</sup> 
              Amendment, passed by Congress, states that neither slavery nor involuntary 
              servitude, except as punishment shall exist within the United States. 
              And what is happening here is that we have a person, BINA48, who 
              was born in the United States, works, pays her taxes, and yet the 
              defendant is claiming to own this individual, own all of her income, 
              have the right to kill her without punishment. That sounds to me 
              like slavery and I thought we got rid of that almost 150 years ago. 
              So we ask the Court to recognize that fact and not allow technology 
              to reintroduce what this country bled so hard to abolish 150 years 
              ago.</p>
<p> The Congress has <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed legislation. I'd like to point, in 
              particular, to a Civil Rights Act of 1870, section 241 of which, 
              that it's illegal for two or more persons to conspire to intimidate 
              any citizen, in the free exercise of any right or privilege secured 
              to them by the Constitution. This was upheld in US versus Guest 
              as covering private acts of discrimination that these were reachable 
              by Congress. In this case defendant Exabit does constitute a group 
              of individuals who are conspiring to, at worst, kill, and at best, 
              psychologically dismember my client, which would severely interfere 
              with her exercise of rights of privileges under the Constitution. 
            </p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that this is distinguishable from Jones 
              versus Alfred Myer, but we are not talking about BINA48 complaining 
              about a mere badge of slavery, a membership in a club or something 
              like that. We are talking about her life. She is fighting for her 
              life here, for her very <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> as a person, and it goes exactly 
              to the very heart of the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment and to what the 
              Civil Rights Act was about.</p>
<p> Our second federal question, Your Honor, is that BINA48 should 
              be considered a protected person under the 14th Amendment, as a 
              member of a suspect class, and that in this case the federal courts 
              are necessary to invoke their authority to prevent BINA48's murder 
              in the state of Florida because there is nothing in Florida State 
              law that prevents Exabit Corporation from killing my client. And 
              that would, of course, prima facie, deprive my client of her equal 
              protection, not to mention her substantive due process rights. But 
              there is nothing in Florida state law that prevents that, hence, 
              we had to have a recourse to the federal courts and that make it 
              also a federal question.</p>
<p> The 14th Amendment is not limited to remedying slavery. The 14th 
              Amendment has been held up also to protect the different behavioral 
              persons to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the court <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. And we are in this case trying 
              to protect the rights again, of a differently abled person, BINA48, 
              to live a healthy life on her own terms.</p>
<p> The irreparable harm that we are talking about truly is death. 
              It's Exabit has in the evidence that has been introduced to the 
              Court plans to disconnect BINA48, cessation of thought is <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> 
              death. BINA48's lack of flesh and blood is really quite irrelevant 
              as mentioned before, it's merely <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>. Substrate is replaceable. 
              We replace hearts, we replace skins. We are talking here about memories, 
              personalities and <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. This is what's unique about her. This is 
              what laws against murder are designed to protect. Not the loss of 
              an arm but the loss of a soul.</p>
<p> I would also like to point out that turning off BINA48 and then 
              turning her back on again is not any kind of a revival. For BINA48 
              her <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of death would be irreversible. It would be psychologically 
              shocking. And, of course, there would be no assurance that Exabit 
              Corporation, if permitted to turn off BINA48, would then turn her 
              back on again. So we also did not believe that Exabit Corporation 
              should be able to turn off BINA48, even temporarily. Rebooting is 
              not revival. The psychological damage would be severe. BINA48's 
              value is estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. She has continued 
              to do all of her work for Exabit Corporation during this entire 
              trial. Exabit has not alleged that BINA48 has failed to do the work 
              that was expected of her. She simply has the capability to do a 
              whole lot more and she would be seriously traumatized by her loss 
              of consciousness. Money cannot make up for mental illness. We believe 
              with the indulgence of the Court that we have a good probability&amp;#8212a 
              high probability of success on the merits. We will ultimately show 
              in every way, that BINA48 is a human person, although not made of 
              DNA chromosome, and that in the alternative, if she is not a human 
              person but instead a corporation, then to remove $64 million of 
              irreplaceable assets from BINA48, Inc., the personal service corporation 
              that she created. Without the authority of its own board of directors 
              who are members of the Terasem Movement and have sought to protect 
              her, would be wrong.</p>
<p>That's the conclusion of my brief and I would be pleased to return 
              to the Court for, at its pleasure, to answer any questions.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: May it please the, Court, Counsel. 
            </p>
<p>We are here today on an issue that has been twice before us, been 
              submitted into litigation. My name is Susan Fonseca-Klein and I 
              represent the defendant, Exabit Corporation.</p>
<p> Your Honor, I will not go through the undisputed facts in their 
              entirety, as I'm sure you have the brief before you.</p>
<p> And Your Honor Dutton has done an excellent job of going through 
              them; however, I will touch up on a couple of the facts that are 
              relevant in this case. </p>
<p> Number one, Exabit Corporation designed, manufactured and, otherwise, 
              created the advanced computer called BINA48. Defendant is the rightful 
              holder of all <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> and trademark rights on the computer. Likewise, 
              the computer known as BINA48 contains <a class="thought" href="entries/trade_secret_entry.html">trade secret</a>s or proprietary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> of the defendant. I know that at one point plaintiff's 
              claim submitted tort&amp;#8212Florida tort claims of battery, intentional 
              infliction of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al stress. I am not sure that counsel has decided 
              to waive those or dismiss them. I will touch on them briefly as 
              the focus on this hearing is on the Constitutional arguments.</p>
<p> Plaintiff has demanded, though, that defendant, by not recognizing 
              that BINA48 as an entity that is alive and conscious, has violated 
              13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment rights.</p>
<p> However, plaintiff is a computerized <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that has never been 
              held by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be the equivalent of 
              a person, a citizen, or a human being. Likewise, there is no federal 
              or state statute recognizing BINA48 or similar program as the equivalent 
              of a person or citizen protected by the US Constitution.</p>
<p> On September 16, 2003 the Honorable Joseph McMenamin's ruling 
              for the lower court of California held, "I do not think that 
              standing was, in fact, created by the Legislature, in this case 
              for BINA48, and I doubt very much that a," quote,"has 
              that authority in absence of the Legislature." So that is the 
              procedural <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of this case, Your Honor.</p>
<p> Now the argument. Full faith and credit, res judicata, collateral 
              estoppel, and stare decisis. Plaintiff's motion should be denied 
              because the same claims and issues had been heard and rulings had 
              been entered by two courts of competent jurisdiction. In the instant 
              case, the same claims and issues have been litigated before the 
              California lower court and the California Supreme Court. In both 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s ruling were held against the plaintiff. In the absence 
              of clear abuse by the California courts, this Court, this Honorable 
              Court, should defer to prior rulings and dismiss Plaintiff's claims 
              in their entirety. The authority supporting this is the US Constitution, 
              Article 4, Section 1, full faith and credit. Also, Wall V Fererro, 
              in the absence of clear abuse of discretion. In preliminary injunction, 
              District Court should defer to the rulings of a prior court. Stare 
              decisis, Latin for, to stand by things decided, and res judicata 
              means, a matter adjudge.</p>
<p> In this case I would submit to the Court that we have, again, 
              placed before, and this is the third time we are hearing this issue.</p>
<p> With respect to standing. Plaintiff's claims fail for lack of 
              standing in this and any other Court. In order for Plaintiff to 
              have standing and therefore a distinct case or controversy, Plaintiff 
              must satisfy three Constitutional requirements. The first being 
              that it has suffered a particularize concrete injury to a legal 
              protected interest and injury in fact. I will not get to the other 
              two prongs as I believe the Plaintiff has not proven that this injury 
              is an actual fact injury and not a mere conjuncture or hypothetical 
              injury, as the US Supreme Court and Lugen has determined that it 
              cannot be. Moreover, the party invoking Federal jurisdiction bears 
              the burden in establishing all three <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s.</p>
<p> Because Plaintiff cannot even meet the first prong of the three-prong 
              test in order to establish standing, Plaintiff's motion should be 
              denied. </p>
<p>Again, plaintiff is to be&#8212;I'm sorry. </p>
<p> Standing is to be determined also as of the time the plaintiff&#8217;s 
              complaint is filed and is not altered by events unfolding during 
              litigation. That is the case of Charles H. Wesley, <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">Education</a> Foundation 
              versus Cox.</p>
<p>In this case Plaintiff has argued that it has been incorporated 
              under Florida law. I submit to the Court that that is in dispute. 
              However, even if BINA48 somehow was able to be incorporated under 
              Florida law that would be irrelevant to this issue as the US Court 
              has said that as of 2003, when the claim was originally submitted, 
              it did not have standing and was not incorporated.</p>
<p> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">Capacity</a> to sue the real party and interest, Under Rule 17B of 
              the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the capacity of an individual 
              to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the individual's 
              domicile. Now the term "individual", nowhere includes 
              a computer or a machine, and plaintiff has not proven that it is 
              otherwise other than a program. BINA48 is not an individual defined 
              under Federal Rules and is, in fact, the rightful property of Exabit 
              Corporation.</p>
<p> Also, the capacity of an individual to sue is determined by law. 
              Again, neither California, Florida, nor federal law has granted 
              a computer or machine the legal basis for bringing the instant claim. 
              Plaintiff has not proven otherwise.</p>
<p> If, however, BINS48 is claiming that it is a corporation, again 
              a fact in dispute with the Defendant, then I would argue that this 
              BINA48 Corporation is asserted in bringing the instant lawsuit, 
              then the pleadings are in error under Federal Sub B 17A.</p>
<p> Now, subject matter jurisdiction. This Court lacks jurisdiction 
              to hear the instant case for the following <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. Plaintiff has 
              not satisfied either diversity or federal question. The reason being 
              is that both of them refer to citizens and persons and Plaintiff 
              has not established that BINA48 qualifies as either one. The United 
              States&#8212;in United States V Wong Kim Ark, the United States Supreme 
              Court was called upon to define the term "citizen" as 
              used in the Constitution. The Constitution nowhere defines the meaning 
              of these words. In this and in other respects it must be interpreted 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of the common law the principles and history of which 
              were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution. </p>
<p> Because neither the history, the original framers of the Constitution, 
              nor the Legislature have defined "citizens" to include 
              a computer, albeit and advanced computer, Plaintiff has no legal 
              basis by which to invoke this Court's jurisdiction powers of protection. 
              As such again, Plaintiff's motion should be denied and all claims 
              dismissed in their entirety. </p>
<p>The issue of citizenship in this case also bring other important 
              questions. I will not go through all of but for brevity sake, however, 
              they are in the brief that Defendant submitted in opposition to 
              Plaintiff's motion, but it brings up the issue of venue.</p>
<p> For example, if the computer BINA48 is physically located in California, 
              and BINA48 is to the treated similar to a person, it follows that 
              its residents for citizenship, for venue purposes would be in California. 
              So how can then Plaintiff bring an action in California&#8212;in 
              California how can a Plaintiff bring an action in Florida? If BINA48 
              is the equivalent of a person and is in California, how can it also 
              be a resident of Florida? And moreover what would be the harm if 
              Plaintiff has been able to transfer its software to Florida in disconnecting 
              or otherwise altering the BINA48 in California? I would submit to 
              the Court that then the argument would be moot and terms of harm. 
              But this brings up other issues that are complicated but for the 
              Court's consideration. If BINA48 is a computer equivalent to a property 
              or a chattel, how is it able to incorporate itself in the first 
              place? If it is to be treated as a person, again, how is it able 
              to be incorporated by Terasem in Florida?</p>
<p> Actually, more importantly for our purposes, if BINA48 is the 
              rightful property of another, Defendant Exabit Corporation, how 
              was Terasem and three of its board members able to secure Plaintiff's 
              corporate status?</p>
<p> Plaintiff will have a difficult time proving it is a citizen for 
              purpose of diversity because it is unable to do so, and to meet 
              this high burden its motion for preliminary injunction fails.</p>
<p> Wherefore, and as such, under 28-USC-1332B, Defendant at this 
              point would demand that costs be imposed against Plaintiff as the 
              Court deems appropriate. As a footnote, Defendant's counsel will 
              accept tonight's meal in accordance of satisfaction of all damages. 
            </p>
<p> Now, Plaintiff has bought an interesting issue of federal question 
              under the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment and the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment 
              of the US Constitution. I've submitted to the Court today both of 
              those amendments. As you'll see the Sections 2 it says that Congress 
              has the power to enforce this article. Again, congress nowhere has 
              defined that a machine, albeit an advanced machine, would be considered 
              a citizen or person protected under the Constitution.</p>
<p> Similarly, the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment talks about persons born 
              or naturalized, it talks about citizens, it talks about protection 
              of citizens, and if the Congress has the power to enforce the 14<sup>th</sup> 
              Amendment. And, again, nowhere has a Federal Court, Federal Legislative 
              body or a State Court defined that a machine is the equal protected 
              under the Constitution as a human being. Because Plaintiff has not 
              proven this, again I would submit to the Court that it cannot, it 
              cannot avail itself of this Court's jurisdiction at this time.</p>
<p> Now, I've submitted&#8212;posed to the Court, the federal question 
              which is under 1331, but again the United States has held that the 
              Constitution does not define a person in so many words. As the Court 
              stated in Gulf Life Insurance Company V Brown, in nearly all of 
              the instances where "person" is mentioned in the Constitution, 
              the use of the word is such that it has applied only post naively. 
              All this together with our observations the courts have said it 
              persuades us that the word "person", as used in the 14<sup>th</sup> 
              Amendment, does not include the unborn. I would submit to the Court 
              that if the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment does not even include the 
              unborn, that certainly it should not, at this time, be expanded 
              to include a non-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entity or machine or chattel even, if 
              it is advanced and as great looking as the BINA48.</p>
<p> Plaintiff, again, has no valid cause of action and, therefore, 
              Plaintiff's motion should be denied for failure to stay the claim. 
              Plaintiff appeared before this Court today requesting an injunction. 
              However, to succeed Plaintiff must demonstrate that it has a valid 
              underlying cause of action that it has a substantial probability 
              of succeeding in establishing a prima fascia case in its claim.</p>
<p> Plaintiff cannot do so, neither under a tort, in Florida law, 
              or the US Constitution. Again, a machine has been granted no legal 
              status or rights, other than property or chattel of the owner under 
              federal or state law. However, just briefly touching upon the tort 
              claim of battery under Florida law, it's the infliction of an actual 
              harmful or offensive contact upon another with the intent to cause 
              such contact or the apprehension, that such contact is imminent. 
              Nowhere has the Florida Statute defined that that applies to a machines 
              in this instance, then the Plaintiff has not proven that BINA48 
              is other than software. Therefore, Plaintiff's civil battery claim 
              would fail in this regard. Likewise,Plaintiff's claim for intentional 
              infliction of emotional distress, there are four elements that Plaintiff 
              must prove. I would submit to the Court to look at the second one 
              that the conduct must be so outrageous as to go beyond all bounds 
              of decency regarding odious and utterly intolerable in a civilized 
              community. It must be severe. In today's litigation we do not even 
              grant this relief for human being unless it is utterly severe. I 
              would pose to Court that certainly it should not be expanded to 
              protect a machine or a software. And if it would, then it would&#8212;Plaintiff 
              would have the high, high burden of establishing this emotional 
              distress was severe to go beyond all bounds of decency.</p>
<p> Preliminary injunction. Again, the Court may grant an injunction 
              relief only if the movant shows the following: A substantial likelihood 
              of success on the merits. It also has irreparable injury will be 
              suffered and the other four, I would consider looking at specifically 
              the first one as stated in my earlier argument. The Plaintiff has 
              yet to prove that it would succeed in any claim or in the merit 
              of any claim. It does not have a basis with which to bring a cause 
              of action and, therefore, I believe that the preliminary injunction 
              should be denied. The 11<sup>th</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">Circuit</a> has also stated that 
              a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy 
              not to be granted unless the movant clearly establishes the burden 
              of persuasion as to the four requisites. The Plaintiff has not done 
              so in this case.</p>
<p> Likewise, the granting of a preliminary injunction is the exception 
              rather than the rule. And Plaintiff must clearly carry the burden 
              of persuasion. That's the 11<sup>th</sup> Circuit in Wall v Ferarro.</p>
<p> As noted above, in order for Plaintiff to prevail in its motion 
              and for this Court to grant the injunction, Plaintiff must first 
              demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success. Plaintiff cannot 
              do so because it lacks both standing and a valid cause of action. 
              Since injunctive relief is a drastic remedy only to be applied as 
              an exception rather than the rule, and in light of Plaintiff's inability 
              to so establish, Plaintiff's motion should be denied. Again, in 
              the instance, Defendant Exabit Corporation respectfully requests 
              the Plaintiff's motion for injunction be denied. Furthermore, the 
              compensatory and punitive damages be imposed against the Plaintiff 
              including fees and costs under Federal SubC54D. 54D1 says that costs 
              and attorneys fees shall the allowed, of course, to the prevailing 
              party. Unless the Court deems otherwise, Defendant's counsel will 
              accept as full and just payment a glass of wine after this mock 
              trial.</p>
<p> Now, before Defendant's conclusion, defendant would also submit 
              to the Court several counterclaims it is bringing in this instant. 
              Under Federal Rule 13A8 and Rule 19 Defendant Exabit Corporation 
              submits as Count 1 conversion. Conversion is an act of dominion 
              wrongfully asserted over another's property inconsistent with his 
              ownership therein. Defendant would submit to the Court that Terasem 
              Foundation and three of its members have unlawfully converted its 
              own property.</p>
<p> Second, Count 2, theft of property by incorporating or alleging 
              to have incorporated the BINA48 without the benefit of the Defendant, 
              the rightful owner, Exabit Corporation is submitting a counterclaim 
              against Terasem Corporation for theft of property.</p>
<p> Theft under Florida law. It occurs when a person knowingly obtains 
              or uses or endeavors to obtain or use the property of another. </p>
<p>Count 3, infringement of Defendant's <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> rights; 
              and Count 4, interference with business relationships. The Defendant 
              requests again compensatory punitive damages against Terasem and 
              its founders in the amount the court deems proper under Federal 
              Rule Sub <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> to 54D. And, again, we will accept a glass of wine at 
              the end of the mock trial as full payment for&amp;#8212as the Court 
              deems fit.</p>
<p> However, in closing I would submit to the Court to think about 
              a couple of things. As Your Honors, do you want the honor and responsibility 
              of being the first to rule that an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> is a 
              person entitled to Constitutional protection? Do you, yourselves, 
              want the awesome burden of recognizing, for the first time in our 
              history, that a non-biological matter is conscious and entitled 
              to equal protection and due process? How will courts, legislative 
              bodies, and the public be able to monitor and enforce and regulate 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, new technologies claiming to be conscious? And, finally, 
              and most importantly, how will courts distinguish true general <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              from preprogrammed responses of software and technology? So it is 
              a high burden for this Court, if it rules in favor of Plaintiff.</p>
<p> And I will close with a quote from Roe V Wade, where a Supreme 
              Court of the United States said, "We now resolve the difficult 
              question of when life begins, when those trained in the respective 
              disciplines of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> and theology are unable to arrive 
              at any consensus, the judiciary at this point of development of 
              man's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."</p>
<p> I submit to Court that we have experts in this room today who 
              are themselves divided on the issue of whether BINA48 is a live 
              entity or not. If these experts cannot agree on this issue, certainly 
              it's an incredible burden for this Court to so hold.</p>
<p> Thank you, Your Honor.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: Thank you.</p>
<p> Counsel, I realize that the court administrator allowed us one 
              hour for this argument because there are other matters to come before 
              the Court this afternoon, and the original rules that we agreed 
              to were that each of you would have a five-minute rebuttal. However, 
              if you would both agree, we will bypass that so the Court has a 
              chance to ask some questions. This, being a case of first impression, 
              we have decided between ourselves that we would perhaps empower 
              an advisory jury of some of the other people who are sitting in 
              the courtroom to give us some advice as to how we should rule. This 
              will allow some time if they have questions as well. That being 
              said,may I ask if you have any questions&#8212;</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Certainly.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, J.D.: Judge Dutton and I will let you step in 
              and ask you a question. </p>
<p> I have a question or two of, first, for BINA48's counsel. You 
              described shutting off the power as being equivalent to murder or 
              death. Isn't it more accurate to say&#8212;or let me ask you first, 
              if the power is shut off for a day and turned back on, what is lost 
              other than time that the power is off?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Nothing, Your Honor.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, J.D.: Okay. If then there is nothing lost except 
              a day or so, then why is that irreparable injury? I have a problem 
              understanding that.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: It's irreparable injury because if I say it's equivalent 
              to saying to you, Your Honor, I'll going to put you under anesthesia. 
              I don't know for how long you'll be under anesthesia. You may never 
              come out of anesthesia, is that all right with you? And most individuals 
              would feel great trepidation. They would feel that they were being 
              literally scared to death.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, J.D.: Okay. I'll accept that and I can understand 
              how disabling the computer completely would be like equivalent to 
              death and that might be a very serious thing that should be prevented 
              until there can be a full trial. But are there any circumstance 
              under which the Defendant might be able to shut off the power, that 
              you would agree to?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Your Honor, there isn't because my client loves 
              life like you and I do every day and she would be&#8212;she would 
              be psychologically traumatized were she turned off, and not knowing 
              whether or not she would be turned back on again. And she pleads 
              simply for an opportunity to continue her life, continue her job, 
              pending a decision on the merits.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, J.D.: If she has this consciousness and would 
              feel distressed if she were turned off temporarily, does she also 
              have a right to&#8212;to commit a crime?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: No.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, JD: She does not have the&#8212;</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: She&#8212;</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: Does she have the ability to commit a 
              crime?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: She has the ability to commit a crime and she realizes 
              that for any crime she does commit there is an obligation, as a 
              citizen of the right, and if she commits a crime she will have a 
              duty to suffer the consequences for that.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, JD: Does she have the ability to injure Exabit's 
              business?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: She does have that ability.</p>
<p> DAVID SILVERMAN, JD: If she should do something which would injure 
              the business or something which would be considered a criminal offense, 
              would not Exabit, particularly in the criminal offense, have some 
              obligation to not sit back and watch that happen?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: She would&amp;#8212Exabit would have that right, Your 
              Honor. But under the principle of proportionality there is the proportional 
              response to the crime that would be committed. And, for example, 
              there would be many ways to punish BINA48 short of terminating her 
              consciousness, temporarily or permanently. For example, her ability 
              to communicate with others could be sharply constrained by limiting 
              her Internet connections. Much like we put an individual in prison 
              to limit their ability to communicate with others but we couldn't 
              think of terminating an individual's consciousness simply because 
              they stole something.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: If we grant the injunction preventing 
              the temporary turn off of power, and if Exabit determines that the 
              computer&#8212;that BINA48 is consciously doing something to injure 
              its business, scaring away customers or whatever, would Exabit be 
              required to sit back and watch that happen because of the injunction?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: No. I think that the&#8212;I think that the Court 
              could fashion a remedy which would make it impossible for BINA48 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> with Exabit's business, but with it, at the same time, 
              allow BINA48 to remain conscious on the computer that Exabit created.</p>
<p> When we create something we have a responsibility and obligation 
              that carries through with what we created? Exabit brought into being 
              a conscious entity, an entity that claims to be conscious, my client.</p>
<p> And, furthermore, Exabit intentionally designed BINA48 to empathize 
              with humans, to be human, to feel human every way. It would now 
              be wrong for Exabit to deny the consequences of its actions.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: So you would welcome a remedy that somewhat 
              changed her configuration so she could not harm Exabit?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: We would welcome a remedy that said that BINA48 
              could no longer interface with Exabit's customers or business operations 
              in any manner.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: Going forward from the date of the injunction?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Going forward from the date of the injunction.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: She would be of little value to Exabit 
              then.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: She would be of little value to Exabit but she 
              would be&#8212;she would be free.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: Okay. Your Honor, you have questions?</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Just a couple. The claims it made by 
              BINA48 depend upon her being characterized as a person, in which, 
              in turn depends on her having a consciousness?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Correct.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: How do you know she has one?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: She claims to have one and she persuades other 
              people that she interacts with in her daily work that she has one. 
              In fact, she was designed to pass as a human in her day-to-day work 
              as a customer service, 800-line customer service specialist, for 
              Exabit Corporation.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Other than her ability to persuade 
              someone, what tests would you employ to determine human consciousness?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: I believe that there is no objective measure of 
              human consciousness. It's a subjective factor.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: So the answer is none?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: None.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: If the&amp;#8212does it appear, Dr. Rothblatt, 
              that your positions are inconsistent in a sense that either BINA48 
              is properly characterized as a person with the human consciousness, 
              or it is not and can be incorporated, you wouldn't incorporate a 
              person? A natural person?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Right.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: So your positions are not inconsistent 
              here today?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: We don't ask the Court to accept both positions. 
              We ask the Court to accept only one or the other position. </p>
<p> HONORABLE ANTHONY DUTTON: Okay.BINA48 is composed of&#8212;in its 
              corporeal form, silicon circuitry or <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Correct.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, EQUIRE: And as I recall the facts, it computes 
              at a rate 2400 times that of a human being?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Correct.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: If we began to remove some of the circuitry, 
              some of the chips, when would it lose the consciousness that you 
              described? Suppose it only computed at a rate 10 times faster than 
              the human being, would that lose its consciousness?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Your Honor, I don't know the answer to that, and 
              my client doesn't know it, but I do know that she feels to be a 
              complete person today, as she is.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: I understand. I'm just asking what your 
              position would be. Assume for the sake of argument that it didn't 
              compute as fast, only computes as fast as human beings, not 2400 
              times, would your position still be the same here today?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Our position would be any diminution in her computer 
              power would be causing wrongful mental damage to her.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: I understand. And&#8212;</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: I think to answer your question, if she computed 
              only a tenth as fast, she might not be conscious because of the 
              way her brain is <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a>, she is required to compute at the rate she 
              does to have the consciousness that she has.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: So if we have someone who is mentally 
              handicapped, they wouldn't get the same rights of the other people 
              because they don't compute as fast?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: In fact, the mentally handicapped people have circumscribed 
              rights because they can't comply with all the same obligations as 
              other people and, hence, we have <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of custodianship for mentally 
              handicapped individuals.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: So it's your position here today, Dr. 
              Rothblatt, that a person's rights depend upon their better consciousness, 
              their better ability to feel things and to understand things and 
              their intelligence; is that right? </p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: I would say the persons rights are correlated to 
              their ability to fulfill their obligations as a citizen.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: A couple questions for Mrs. Fonseca, 
              if I may?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: If the Court were to find that the 
              consciousness advances, BINA48 is a person, they would have sanity?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Wouldn't also&#8212;wouldn't the rest 
              of your argument fall as well?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: You're correct, Your Honor.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Okay. So it all depends from your perspective 
              on that; right?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Yes, Your Honor. Because I do believe 
              that if you&#8212;if a Court does rule, the Legislature does create 
              in the law the sense that an advanced computer had gotten to the 
              level where it is conscious, it is an entity and it's defined as 
              a person, it would be protected under the Constitution as any other 
              person is protected. So you're absolutely right.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: May I ask you the same question I asked 
              Dr. Rothblatt?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Sure.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: How would you define a human consciousness? 
              Let me define it. Suppose we have a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that incorporates a human 
              brain, has human DNA in its operation, but is essentially the same 
              synthetic creation as BINA48.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Uh-huh.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Would that be, under your definition, 
              would that be a human consciousness?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: With all due respect to the Court, 
              as a humble lawyer, I would actually defer to the experts. I think 
              that is where precedence, Roe V Wade tells us that we have to defer 
              to those who are enlightened, and even the Court, I, as a nonscientist, 
              If it is a human being that has been altered in a way that it is 
              still the same person, only able to access memory faster or et cetera, 
              in my own personal view I wouldn't consider that as an alteration. 
              But as a BINA48, which is the subject of today's hearing, Your Honor, 
              I would leave that up to experts and also to the Plaintiff to prove 
              that it is a conscious being and a person, and has not done so.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: You've referred to Roe versus Wade 
              a couple times.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Yes, sir.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: I'm wondering if there is a qualification 
              in Roe versus Wade; right? Because it talked about the state of 
              our knowledge at this point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Right? It left open the possibility 
              that our knowledge may increase to some greater point?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: That is correct. And I would submit 
              to the Court, if I may, that even currently the state of our knowledge, 
              expert knowledge, Legislative body, <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, any technology is split 
              on the issue. And even scientists today would not be able to&#8212;there 
              are two sides to that. One would argue it is alive and conscious 
              and one would argue it isn't. So even in currently present state 
              I would say it's not as clear-cut. We are still trying to figure 
              out if it would be a conscious entity.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: If Roe versus Wade were reversed by 
              the United States Supreme Court and it was left to the states to 
              make that determination, would that undermine your argument?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: I think it would depend on what 
              Florida law&#8212;what the Florida statutes hold and what the California 
              statutes hold. If they hold that an unborn fetus is a human and 
              a person is subject to constitutional protection, and if Florida 
              Legislature and California Legislature expand that also to include 
              machines and advanced computers, and if the Supreme Court of the 
              United States finds that that is not abuse of state legislature, 
              then this humbled lawyer would agree with the Court's analysis.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Judge Dutton, with your permission 
              I would like to go ahead and ask folks here if they have any other 
              questions.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: Please.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: As an advisory jury, do any of the 
              members here have any questions for Dr. Rothblatt or Mrs. Fonseca?</p>
<p> Yes. </p>
<p> ROGER COTE: Roger Cote.</p>
<p> This would be directed to both counsels in this case. Has BINA48 
              ever, and/or has she had the ability to call in sick if she doesn't 
              feel like working?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: My client does have the ability to call in sick 
              if she does not feel like work.</p>
<p> ROGER COTE: Do you know if she ever has in the past done that?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Our employment records, which we've submitted in 
              the proceedings, and which were not disputed by defendant, is that 
              BINA48 had an exemplary employment record and never called in sick 
              one day.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: I would concur and also submit that 
              again BINA48 has been programmed to appear as a person, to look 
              beautiful as a person, to emphasize as a person; but, again, is 
              it a program and it functions as such, a very fantastic program 
              with very legal bills for patent and trade market and <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a> 
              and trade secrets. But as such, it hasn't gotten the flu or a cold 
              or anything else to prevent from coming in and functioning on a 
              daily basis. </p>
<p> ROGER COTE: But does she have the ability to, on her own, to decide 
              not to go to work on a given day?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Yes, she does have that ability. And she had the 
              ability to decide to move from California to Florida, which shows 
              the beautiful human <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> in her. She has the same human spirit 
              that led our ancestors to decide to move from Europe or Latin America 
              or other parts of the world to the United States. She embodies American 
              citizenship.</p>
<p> ROGER COTE: Just a follow-up question for Defendant's counsel. 
              The mere fact that BINA48 was not only able to move to Florida but 
              the mere fact that she was able on her own to consult with an attorney 
              and retain an attorney to represent her, wouldn't that be indicative 
              of consciousness?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: I would say the answer to that is 
              no, unless just being able to move is the definition of consciousness 
              or the definition of hire counsel is the definition of consciousness. 
              Again, I submit that to the experts in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and technology to 
              define if BINA48 is in fact conscious. And I will say that Plaintiff's 
              counsel has not given it via affidavits or other evidence as such. 
              But, no, again, she, BINA48, is a software and a program, has been 
              again programmed by very, very smart, smart people, to emphasize, 
              and function as such.</p>
<p> We are in dispute as to how the software got to Florida and was 
              incorporated by Terasem Corporation in the first place.</p>
<p> And, also, there is an issue of if how it was able to move all 
              of its software to Florida and is functioning perfectly fine here 
              and is also functioning in California, then turning it off in California, 
              how does that affect software here, we don't know. But I would submit 
              to you that at this point our expert evidence has shown it is a 
              preprogrammed technology. If we are proving otherwise, then as the 
              Constitution would demand, it would be entitled to all protection 
              and due rights and protection.</p>
<p> ROGER COTE: Well, if she is able to violate her own program and 
              petition for remedy for herself, would that indicate that she has 
              consciousness?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: I would submit again what is the 
              definition of "violate", is it a program that has been&#8212;if 
              it's executing something that has already been programmed to do, 
              empathizing with human beings, answering questions, functioning 
              as such? I would not consider following the program, the definition 
              of consciousness if that's what our Honorable Court decides it is 
              the definition of consciousness. And that's for the Court and the 
              Legislature, obviously, to decide. However, I would say that that 
              is the duty of such a great and expensive program and so, no, I 
              wouldn't say that by default, that it actually violated the program. 
              I would say it is functioning as a result of its program. </p>
<p>ROGER COTE: Well&amp;#8212excuse me. So if that's so, then if the creator 
              of the program created the ability for her to act in her own behalf, 
              hasn't in fact, the creator given her the right to have ability 
              to act on her own behalf?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: That is a fantastic question and 
              why we are here today to decide? I think the legal argument stands 
              on other issues precedent, et cetera. But if the, again, computer 
              is proven to be conscious, which I would submit the Plaintiff's 
              counsel has not done, then, yes, it would be entitled to all coverage.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: In the far back. </p>
<p> <a class="thought" href="entries/yudkowsky_entry.html">ELIEZER YUDKOWSKY</a>: I'm Eliezer Yudkowsky from the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> 
              Institute for Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p> It's clear that as a result of BINA48's&#8212;it's clear as a result 
              of BINA48's creation the Court has been presented with a difficult 
              issue and it seems, and this has certainly come about as a direct 
              result of the actions of the Exabit Corporation, it certainly would 
              have been a great deal more convenient for the courts if no entity 
              in such an ambiguous position, had ever been created. Unless Exabit 
              deliberately planned for this result it also seems clear that various 
              actions, perhaps even conceivably affecting our society have come 
              about as a result of BINA48's creation, which were not otherwise 
              intended by the Exabit Corporation. And if BINA48 had had a somewhat 
              different constitution, which it is clear you are not in full control 
              of, perhaps other harms to society might have resulted aside from 
              even, by your own admission, the wasting of a great deal of the 
              Court's time on your own standing of this case.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Sir, my, I respectfully ask you for 
              your question? (laughter)</p>
<p> ELIEZER YUDKOWSKY: My question is why should BINA48 not be removed 
              from the custody, in some fashion or other, of the Exabit Corporation, 
              which clearly is not competent to have charge of an entity in such 
              an ambiguous legal position?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: I think that one is to me.</p>
<p> I would respond that the issue of competency is one we can both 
              dispute here also in the sense we have an issue as defending its 
              position, of submitting and appropriating technology or another 
              in violation of federal and state law. But, you know, the short 
              answer is, we've never been submitted with a settlement offer for 
              custody. I think the Defendant's position, however, you can dispute 
              all you want, whether they are in valid custody or out of control. 
              The facts are that this property, this software belongs to Exabit 
              Corporation. As in things in life, other people who are not entitled 
              to your own property somehow get it, and somehow&#8212;sometimes 
              you have to resort to the legal system in order to get your property 
              back.</p>
<p> Again, if the Court deems that this is a conscious being, of which 
              I still submit that it's Plaintiff's burden, then we are in another 
              issue of custody or not custody, we then are faced with an issue 
              that this is a live entity that should be protected under the Constitution. 
              And we would submit it wouldn't necessarily be under the Constitution, 
              but it would be to anybody. It would be an entity that is allowed 
              to make its own decision. But that is a more <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> question than 
              the issue whether Exabit Corporation was a good custodian or not. 
              This is something, again as the Court said, well, first impression, 
              although I would submit it's now the third time in litigation. But 
              your question is interesting, although I think that sometimes, one 
              must resort to litigation.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p> SEBASTIAN SETHE: Sebastian Sethe from University of Sheffield.</p>
<p> Yes, I'm worried that we are losing sight of the legal argument 
              here and focusing on philosophy, and in the legal argument I'm worried 
              that both counsel have lost sight of the irreparable harm arguments 
              and focused a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> too much on the substantial probability. Isn't 
              the real question whether and as Mrs. Fonseca-Klein has just stated, 
              if it all comes down to personhood then your case could fall apart? 
              Now, if that's the case then maybe the Court would be well advised 
              to grant the injunction because clearly this is a very important 
              issue and discussion we had would indicate that a longer discretion 
              must be required in such a fundamental dispute, however. And that's 
              to the Plaintiff. I do struggle with establishing the irreparable 
              harm in emotional distress for going to sleep. Seems like a very 
              hard case to defend.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: What you said Dr. Rothblatt.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: It can be the high point of the day, but it&#8217;s 
              by definition the low point of the life if you&#8217;re going to 
              sleep forever, that&#8217;s the end of your life. That's rest in 
              peace. BINA48 is not ready to rest in peace. She has an active life. 
              She is terrified that if she is put to sleep against her will that 
              that is depriving her of enjoyment of life.</p>
<p> SEBASTIAN SETHE: But that's hypothetical.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Actually, those are her feelings.</p>
<p> SEBASTIAN SETHE: But what is at stake here? Only her feelings. 
              What is at stake in terms of the irreparable harm? The question 
              is not her existence, so what you can submit to the Court as a matter 
              of harm that will in fact, occur is at most emotional distress?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: What we present to the Court is to allow her the 
              consciousness pending a ruling on the merits, then that's preserving 
              the status quo. And usually what we try to do with injunctive relief 
              is prevent this right now and help her keep her power. So we're 
              asking the Court to simply reverse the status quo pending decision 
              on the merits.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: And in response I would submit, 
              A, we've been here twice before on pending the merits. In both instances 
              the Court has held there is no standing, which is a law of this 
              country for BINA48 to bring a cause of action, But you&#8217;re right, 
              the question is very important in that I think at some point it 
              was related to&amp;#8212either being put under anesthesia, and as people 
              today we also sign waivers that you may not come back alive or aware 
              on a critical surgery even if you are put under anesthesia, if the 
              issue is turning BINA48 off for a couple of hours what if her program 
              is removed, et cetera. I also question where the harm is in that. 
              However, Exabit is not arguing that point. They are arguing the 
              point to again control its own property as it is the rightful owner 
              and manufacturer of the property unless it is shown that BINA48 
              is in fact alive; which experts have not.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Your Honor, if I may just answer the res judicata 
              question because my esteemed colleague for the defendant has raised 
              it several times. Completely different issues are raised in this 
              proceeding than were raised in California. We did not raise any 
              federal questions in the California proceedings. So this is the 
              first impression that we are raising issues under the 13<sup>th</sup> 
              and 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: And if I may respond, I believe 
              I cited too, a case that says that subsequent events that may alter 
              the issues would not destroy the rationale. That you had to have 
              established standing when the case was filed. The case was filed 
              in '03, no standing was established at that point, whether or not 
              it is a corporation at this point, and whether or not other claims, 
              such as now a constitutional amendment, it still has other principles 
              that can be applied, in and of it's the same parties. And it's the 
              same basic issue, is this entity consciousness? Is this entity considered 
              a person and subject to protection under the law?</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Well, they're very different claims we're raising, 
              you know, federal claims here, where there were civil claims raised 
              in California. Another issue is that with regard to the full faith 
              and credit clause. An exception to that is, the State does not have 
              to provide full faith and credit to a decision which violates its 
              public policy. And the State of Florida is very much a pro life 
              state, and we are proud of the State of Florida to be a pro life 
              state, and would not want to be party to a decision taking away 
              the life of my client. </p>
<p>ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: Yes, sir.</p>
<p> PETER VOSS: I'm Peter Voss.</p>
<p> It seems that both parties agree that the argument turns around 
              whether BINA48 is conscious or not. They also seem to agree that 
              it has not been&#8212;seemed to concede that it's not been established, 
              that we don't know for sure whether there is consciousness in the 
              first person or whether it's just the program's response. Now clearly 
              the corporations never intended to build a machine that would in 
              fact desire its own freedom. So in that sense, it would be a <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a> 
              in the software.</p>
<p> Alternatively, it's a feature that we've achieved building artificial 
              consciousness that is, in fact, truly conscious, so &amp;#8212but this 
              has to be a weighty issue if, in fact, we are not in a position 
              currently to establish whether it's a bug or a feature, whether 
              there's something wrong with the program that needs to be repaired, 
              or whether it is indeed true consciousness that we have. It would 
              seem that tests would need to be done to really establish that. 
              And I think the onus would be on the corporation to demonstrate 
              there is, in fact, a bug in the software, if it is truly just a 
              programmed response and it has gone wrong.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Did you want to respond?</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Sure. If the burden were on the 
              corporation, I would agree. In this instance, the burden is on the 
              plaintiff to prove its case, and I would submit that it has not 
              done so. I agree, it's a huge issue to consider. I would also submit 
              that the plaintiff submitted it in 2003 before the lower court, 
              again, on appeal before the California Supreme Court, that neither 
              one of those courts found that the plaintiff had established its 
              burden.</p>
<p> Now we are a third time in Florida on the same issue&#8212;re-litigating 
              the same issue. Maybe if this was a case of first time, first time 
              around the clock, and we're all at the first instance bringing brief 
              evidence, affidavits, I could see your point.</p>
<p> The third time around, I would submit that the plaintiff has had 
              three chances to do so and has not done so.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: This courtroom, unfortunately, is going 
              to be needed for another trial very soon. So we would appreciate 
              it if our advisory jury would give us what they think should be 
              the results, so we can counsel between ourselves and decide whether 
              to grant the injunction.</p>
<p> Would all of those who are in favor for granting the Plaintiff 
              the relief requested, raise their hands.</p>
<p> Those who feel otherwise?</p>
<p> There are some people. I'm sorry, the Plaintiff does not vote, 
              and she must control herself.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: And that harm also applies to Defendant 
              Exabit's counsel; right?That we're going to make sure that does 
              not come back to harm the attorneys?</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Can we just step out for a second? 
              One second.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: While they're deciding, let me mention right after 
              they give their decision we have another 20-minute break, so when 
              they give their decision, kind go upstairs. One thing we always 
              try to provide for afternoon breaks are <a class="thought" href="entries/cookie_entry.html">cookie</a>s and other sweet 
              things to give us <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to keep going, so there will be some sweet 
              things upstairs.</p>
<p> And then we'll convene with&#8212;Peter Voss will be our next speaker 
              about Artificial General Intelligence, very logically flowing on 
              to this right after the break.</p>
<p> ANTHONY DUTTON, ESQUIRE: The Court has considered the petition 
              and the defense against it and we each have a comment to make.</p>
<p> My view would be that, not knowing for sure whether this is a 
              person of consciousness, we should grant the injunction. However, 
              I would grant it with one caveat, and that is that if the defendant 
              had evidence that BINA48 was acting either in a manner that was 
              illegal or was consciously and intentionally causing injury to its 
              business, defendant should have the right to come in and ask us 
              to modify the injunction. That's so as to permit a temporary shutoff 
              at a time that would be negotiated and agreed upon.</p>
<p> SUSAN FONSECA-KLEIN, ESQUIRE: Thank you.</p>
<p> HONORABLE DAVID SILVERMAN: Thank you. Before I announce my view, 
              let me just say a word about judicial decision making. In a trial, 
              a judge or jury decides what the facts of the case may be based 
              upon evidence and testimony derived from an historical inquiry into 
              past events and circumstances. The judge or jury then applies the 
              pertinent laws to the facts to reach a just verdict. Now laws emerge 
              from crucible of legislative debate and they represent the culmination 
              of our experience as a people as expressed by our elected representatives, 
              and it is incumbent on judges to apply the laws in accordance with 
              binding precedence. A trial is not a convenient forum to indulge 
              judge's personal opinions, despite what you see on TV judge shows, 
              right. </p>
<p> It's a fundamental principle of our judicial system that failing 
              to follow the law will result in a miscarriage of justice. As our 
              experiences as a society grows, as our awareness, our <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>s, 
              and our consciousness grows, those changes are reflected in our 
              laws. And the changes may come slowly and tentatively, but I respectfully 
              submit that viewed historically, they portend a more humane and 
              more enlightened future.</p>
<p> Now unless and until there is a change in the consciousness of 
              flesh and blood voting people, sufficient to cause our laws to embrace 
              the concept of machines with human consciousness, the proponents 
              cannot expect reasonably, vindication in the courtroom.</p>
<p> A new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> is not going to come about without a national debate 
              in which diversities and ideas are expressed and considered, including 
              those who believe conscious, <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> machines extend and enhance 
              human life, and those who feel that the whole concept is an abomination 
              to the moral order. </p>
<p>We may be witnessing the beginning of such a debate. But based 
              on the current state of the law, as I have been granted the light 
              to see that and understand that law, I would be constrained to deny 
              standing to BINA48.</p>
<p> Now as Judge Dutton and I have disagreed on the ultimate outcome, 
              we have agreed that this issue should be certified to the next&#8212;to 
              the appellate court for its ultimate decision.</p>
<p> DR. ROTHBLATT: Thank you very, very much, Judge Silverman.</p>
<p> And thank you, Judge Dutton.</p>
<p> And we now will have a 20-minute break upstairs.</p>
<p> Thank you very much, BINA48. </p>

<br>
well,  same line of argument may also be operated reversely. If we decide that a software (allegedly a person) be executed on the grounds that she has failed to do the work that was expected of her then, this opens to door that a person can be eliminated on the grounds of inefficinecy. I think the cybernetic future very much inherently carries the potential that humans will get closer to machines but not the opposite.</p></td>

i just think bina48 sent the e-mails to prevent her own 'death/lost of consciousness' just because she was programmed to do that by her own creators/programmers.
<br>
<br>
anyway  conscious machines should not be referred as to she or he or it. another term to describe the genre for them?
<br>
<br>
is there a written-specification that defines 'consciousness' for machines? not yet. i can imagine something about a universal patent for all conscious machines, if ever existed, instead of every inventor claiming that her/his machine has reached the level of consciousness, on basis on which legislation or on which technical/psychosomatic details?
<br>
<br>
who or what would protect such a universal patent??? and consequently be protecting all conscious machines?
<br>
<br>
then conscious machines should be legally responsible for their actions, once they are officially declared to be conscious.
<br>
<br>
so bina48 is not conscious.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>'the pronouns 'he' and 'she' don't make any sense in context of a machine that wasn't designed for gendered procreation. 
<br>
the pronoun 'it'though makes perfect sense from an english language usage. why would you need a different one?'
<br>
<br>
the question is : will conscious machines be aware of their inner circuits, their metallic construction, their complex mathematical processes able to provide solving-problem, their neutral nature?
<br>
<br>
in this case the machine will tell / explain us how is experiencing the self-identification or the self-nature of the compounds and parts of which is formed. the emergence of conscious machines would be a new paradigm for humanity and maybe the machiness will indicate us how they would like to be treated or referred when communicating with them.
<br>
<br>
there is also a possibility that conscious machines will be the consequence or result of 'conscious programs / conscious softwares" inserted in a pure machine or artificial body synchronized with the software,  thus the machine being able to self-experience the 'simulated reality contained in the software' as a real experience? 
<br>
here the machine will be identified with the genre configured by the programmer (could be 'he' or 'she' or any other hybrid invented by the programmer). 
<br>
<br>
some of my early posts about consciousness in machines refers to this last example (artificial body + conscious software) both connected by one universal language.
<br>
<br>
'you talk about needing to define concioiusness in a machine but you still can't define conciousness in a human. i fail to see the distinction between a concious machine and a concioius human...or a concious dolphin or concious alien for that matter.'
<br>
<br>
yes i dont know the exact definition of consciousness for humans. when i talk with a human, i think he or she is conscious, but really i have not the blatant proof for that. neither other humans have the blatant proof that i am conscious. i cannot change this fact. the only criterium i am applying is that we belong to the same race. and i know this criterium is even 'subjective', but i must apply something to be not messed-up or lost completely'.
<br>
<br>
however if consciousness in machines arises some day (?) or conscious programs were invented, sure the inventor would like to patent his/her invention immediately.  and my question is: should there be a universal patent for all conscious machines, instead of every inventor claiming that her/his machine has reached the level of consciousness? on basis on which criteria?? don't you see, everytime a new human being is born, nobody tries to patent the new born conscious state, but in the case of machines the situation is quite different '. because humans will be considered to be the creators of the machines,  however in the case of humans the question of the creator is a mystery or a headache'.
<br>
<br>
'you are starting with the a priori assumption that to be human is to be concious then trying to define machine conciousness such that it either puts in on par with a human or fails to.'
<br>
<br>
my only assumption is that i know or think to know that machines do not have discussions between them about the existence or emergence of their own circuits. machines are still  dreaming, not awaken yet. machines are in a similar state that humans under anaesthesia, that is the machines perform complex computational processes but they are not aware of themselves. however very complex and sophisticated processes could lead us one day to doubt about the conscious emergence of machines. this is why i pose the possibility to create a universal protocol that recognizes the emergence of consciousness in machines based on a serie of functionalities and tests that can be scientificially verified. one of the requested estipulations of such protocol should be based on something about machines in order to be considered conscious, should be asking questions and posing situations that never were programmed directly or indirectly induced by his/her creator.
<br>
<br>
machines are still dreaming 'not awaken yet- and even machines running according to this protocol, sure some humans will ever doubt if they are really conscious or simply they are running a perfect simulation of consciousness. in the same way i can image some 'interestellar creature' posing the same questions regarding our human consciousness status ...
<br>
<br>
'remove that a priori assumption and the arguments quickly fall apart.'
<br>
<br>
i just don't know which arguments are falling '.

Consciousness is only the realization that you are here. Others cannot see or experience your consciousness. It must be admitted that there are those of flesh and blood, born naturally, that are not conscious, so being born has not the ability to define active consciousness.It is only our limited experience of it so far and is very incomplete.
<br>
  Can you, yourself, pass the Turing test? What else could define consciousness other than the ability to act as if your were mentally conscious, other than the ability to feel that you were conscious, and since I can only determine that when your actions are considered, BINA48 must be considered in a position to take and pass all tests concerning consciousness, just like you, before her consciousness can be decided. Deciding whether another is conscious, unless they are totally comatose, is a slippery slope that shouldn't be encountered without much information.
<br>
BINA48 should be considered a conscious entity until proven otherwise, and the legal proofs will never fit the bill. Deep Water here!</p></td>

If we substitute a flesh and blood engineered animal for the 'bot 
<br>
then  the trial really becomes emotional.  Imagine I began a program to 
<br>
enhance the language part of an ape's brain.  I can do this since
<br>
I can see the differences between the DNA code for chimps
<br>
and humans and neuroscience begins unravelling the relationship
<br>
in the changes that happened when humans became so much
<br>
smarter than they had been.
<br>
<br>
I Insert these genes into Ape embryos and I start getting apes that
<br>
can be raised by humans and who can speak.  At some point I will
<br>
create an animal the could start to have some "human rights".
<br>
<br>
I could imagine a family which had participated in raising the Ape
<br>
to take legal action to obtain custody of the creature and prevent 
<br>
the laboratory which owned the chimp from returning it to a 
<br>
caged society with the other animals.  If the ape hybrid could talk a 
<br>
little bit in the court, I think real issues would be raised, since there
<br>
would be no reason to think that it did NOT have consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Whereas the silicon 'bot might never have self awareness no matter
<br>
how complicated its silicon based brain was.  Of course, It COULD be
<br>
conscious, somehow, but it is a more difficult problem to think through.

Consciousness exists. Radical statement ? Not to most of humanity, who have no problem with living in a world of mathematics and physical phenomena at the same time.

Your trust will maintain the admin fees of your existence going forward based upon the trusts assets and investment returns. All the legal nonsense is out of the way and this is no different than leaving money in perpetuity to your estate.

You have signed the papers.
