<h2>Bootstrapping our way to an ageless <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a></h2>
<p>I have a confession to make. In Chapters  5 through 12, where I explained the details of SENS, I elided one rather  <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant fact&#8212;a fact that the biologists among my audience will very  probably have spotted. I'm going to address that omission in this chapter,  building on a line of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing that I introduced in an ostensibly quite  circumscribed <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> towards the end of Chapter 9.</p>
<p>              It is this: the therapies that we develop in a decade or so in mice,  and those that may come only a decade or two later for humans, will not be  perfect. Other things being equal, there will be a residual accumulation of  damage within our bodies, however frequently and thoroughly we apply these  therapies, and we will eventually <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> age-related decline and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> just  as now, only at a greater age. Probably not all that much greater either &#8212;  probably only 30-50 years older than today.</p>
<p>              But other things won't be equal. In this chapter, I'm going to  explain why not&#8212;and why, as you may already know from other sources, I expect  many people alive today to live to 1000 years of age and to avoid age-related  health problems even at that age.</p>
<p>              I'll start by describing why it's unrealistic to expect these  therapies to be perfect.</p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> didn't leave notes</h2>
<p>I emphasised in Chapter 3 that the body is a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, and that  that's both why it ages and why it can in principle be maintained. I made a  comparison with vintage cars, which are kept fully functional even 100 years  after they were built, using the same maintenance technologies that kept them  going 50 years ago when they were already far older than they were ever  designed to be. More complex machines can also be kept going indefinitely,  though the expense and expertise involved may mean that this never happens in  practice because replacing the machine is a reasonable alternative. This sounds  very much like a reason to suppose that the therapies we develop to stave off  aging for a few decades will indeed be enough to stave it off indefinitely.</p>
<p>              But actually that's overoptimistic. All we can reliably infer from a  comparison with man-made machines is that a truly comprehensive panel of  therapies, which truly repairs everything that goes wrong with us as a result  of aging, is possible <em>in principle</em>&#8212; not that it is foreseeable. And in fact, if we look back at the therapies I've  described in this book, we can see that actually one thing about them is very  unlike maintenance of a man-made machine: these therapies strive to minimally  alter metabolism itself, and target only the initially inert side-effects of  metabolism, whereas machine maintenance may involve adding extra things to the  machinery itself (to the fuel or the oil of a car, for example). We can get  away with this sort of invasive maintenance of man-made machines because we  (well, some of us!) know how they work right down to the last detail, so we can  be adequately sure that our intervention won't have unforeseen side-effects.  With the body&#8212;even the body of a mouse&#8212;we are still profoundly ignorant of  the details, so we have to sidestep our ignorance by interfering as little as  possible.</p>
<p>              What that means for efficacy of therapies is that, as we fix more  and more aspects of aging, you can bet that new aspects will be unmasked. These  new things&#8212;eighth and subsequent items to add to the "seven deadly things"  listed in this book&#8212;will not be fatal at a currently normal age, because if  they were, we'd know about them already. But they'll be fatal eventually,  unless we work out how to fix them too.</p>
<p>              It's not just "eighth things" we have to worry about, either. Within  each of the seven <em>existing</em> categories, there are some subcategories that will be easier to fix than  others. For example, there are lots of chemically distinct cross-links  responsible for stiffening our arteries; some of them may be broken with  ALT-711 and related <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, but others will surely need more sophisticated  agents that have not yet been developed. Another example: obviating  <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a>l <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> by putting modified copies of it into the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s  requires gene therapy, and thus far we have no gene therapy delivery <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>  ("vector") that can safely get into all cells, so for the foreseeable future  we'll probably only be able to protect a subset of cells from mtDNA mutations.  Much better vectors will be needed if we are to reach all cells.</p>
<p>              In practice, therefore, therapies that rejuvenate 60-year-olds by 20  years will not work so well the second <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> around. When the therapies are  applied for the first time, the people receiving them will have 60 years of  "easy" damage (the types that the therapies can remove) and also 60 years of  "difficult" damage. But by the time beneficiaries of these therapies have  returned to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly 60 (which, let's presume, will happen when they're  chronologically about 80), the damage their bodies contain will consist of 20  years of "easy" damage and 80 years of "difficult" damage. Thus, the therapies  will only rejuvenate them by a much smaller amount, say ten years. So they'll  have to come back sooner for the third treatment, but that will benefit them  even less&#8230; and very soon, just like Achilles catching up with the tortoise in  Zeno's <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>, aging will get the better of them. See <strong>Figure 1</strong>.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1" border="1" height="305" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162906im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/degreyendinganging_ch14-f1.png" width="513"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>. <em>The diminishing returns delivered by repeated  application of a rejuvenation regime.</em></p>
<p>              Back in Chapters 3 and 4 I explained that, contrary to one's  <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, rejuvenation may actually be easier than retardation. Now it's time  to introduce an even more counterintuitive fact: that, even though it will be  much harder to double a middle-aged <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>'s remaining lifespan than a  middle-aged <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>'s, multiplying that remaining lifespan by much larger factors&#8212;ten or 30, say&#8212;will be much <em>easier</em> in humans than in mice.</p>
<h2>The two-speed pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a></h2>
<p>I'm now going to <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> briefly from <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of  science, or more precisely the history of technology.</p>
<p>              It was well before recorded history that people began to take an  interest in the possibility of flying: indeed, this may be a desire almost as  ancient as the desire to live forever. Yet, with the notable but sadly  unreproduced exception of Daedalus and Icarus, no success in this area was  achieved until about a century ago. (If we count balloons then we must double  that, but really only airships&#8212;balloons that can control their direction of  travel reasonably well&#8212;should be counted, and they only emerged at around the  same time as the aircraft.) Throughout the previous few centuries, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers  from Leonardo on devised ways to achieve controlled powered flight, and we must  presume that they believed their designs to be only a few decades (at most)  from realisation. But they were wrong.</p>
<p>              Ever since the Wright brothers flew at Kitty   Hawk, however, things have been curiously different. Having  mastered the basics, aviation engineers seem to have <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed to ever greater  heights (literally as well as metaphorically!) at an almost serenely smooth  pace. To pick a representative selection of milestones: Lindbergh flew the  Atlantic 24 years after the first powered flight occurred, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>  jetliner (the Comet) debuted 22 years after that, and the first supersonic  airliner (Concorde) followed after a further 20 years.</p>
<p>              This stark contrast between fundamental breakthroughs and  incremental refinements of those breakthroughs is, I would contend, typical of  the history of technological fields. Further, I would argue that it's not  surprising: both psychologically and scientifically, bigger advances are harder  to estimate the difficulty of.</p>
<p>              I mention all this, of course, because of what it tells us about the  likely future progress of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> therapies. Just as people were wrong  for centuries about how hard it as to fly but eventually cracked it, we've been  wrong since time immemorial about how hard aging is to combat but we'll  eventually crack it too. But just as people have been pretty reliably correct  about how to make better and better aircraft once they had the first one, we  can expect to be pretty reliably correct about how to repair the damage of  aging more and more comprehensively once we can do it a little.</p>
<p>              That's not to say it'll be easy, though. It'll take time, just as it  took time to get from the Wright Flyer to Concorde. And <em>that</em> is why, if you want to live to 1000, you can count yourself lucky  that you're a human and not a mouse. Let me take you through the scenario, step  by step.</p>
<p>              Suppose we develop Robust Mouse Rejuvenation in 2016, and we take a  few dozen two-year-old mice and duly treble their one-year remaining lifespans.  That will mean that, rather than dying in 2017 as they otherwise would, they'll  die in 2019. Well, maybe not&#8212;in particular, not if we can develop better  therapies by 2018 that re-treble their remaining lifespan (which will by now be  down to one year again). But remember, they'll be harder to repair the second  time: their overall damage level may be the same as before they received the  first therapies, but a higher proportion of that damage will be of types that  those first therapies can't fix. So we'll only be able to achieve that  re-trebling if the therapies we have available by 2018 are considerably more  powerful than those that we had in 2016. And to be honest, the chance that  we'll improve the relevant therapies that much in only two years is really  pretty slim. In fact, the likely amount of progress in just two years is so  small that it might as well be considered zero. Thus, our murine heroes will  indeed die in 2019 (or 2020 at best), despite our best efforts.</p>
<p>              But now, suppose we develop Robust Human Rejuvenation in 2031, and  we take a few dozen 60-year-old humans and duly double their 30-year remaining  lifespans. By the time they come back in (say) 2051, biologically 60 again but  chronologically 80, they'll need better therapies, just as the mice did in  2018. But luckily for them, we'll have had not two but <em>twenty</em> years to improve the therapies. And 20 years is a very  respectable period of time in technology&#8212;long enough, in fact, that we will  with very <em>high</em> probability have  succeeded in developing sufficient improvements to the 2031 therapies so that  those 80-year-olds can indeed be restored from biologically 60 to biologically  40, or even a little younger, despite their enrichment (relative to 2031) in  harder-to-repair types of damage. So unlike the mice, these humans will have  just as many years (20 or more) of youth before they need third-generation  treatments as they did before the second.</p>
<p>And so on  &#8230;. See <strong>Figure 2</strong>.<br>

<h2>Longevity Escape <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">Velocity</a></h2>
<p>The key conclusion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> I've <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>  out above is that there is a threshold rate of biomedical progress that will  allow us to stave off aging indefinitely, and that that rate is implausible for  mice but entirely plausible for humans. If we can make rejuvenation therapies  work well enough to give us time to make then work better, that will give us  enough additional time to make them work better still, which will &#8230; you get the  idea. This will allow us to escape age-related decline indefinitely, however  old we become in purely chronological terms. I think the term "longevity escape  velocity" (LEV) sums that up pretty well.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup><a name="ref1"></a></p>
<p>              One feature of LEV that's worth pointing out is that we can  accumulate lead-time. What I mean is that if we have a period in which we  improve the therapies faster than we need to, that will allow us to have a  subsequent period in which we don't improve them so fast. It's only the average  rate of improvement, starting from the arrival of the first therapies that give  us just 20 or 30 extra years, that needs to stay above the LEV threshold.</p>
<p>              In case you're having trouble assimilating all this, let me describe  it in terms of the physical state of the body. Throughout this book, I've been  discussing aging as the accumulation of molecular and cellular "damage" of  various types, and I've highlighted the fact that a modest quantity of damage  is no problem&#8212;metabolism just works around it, in the same way that a  household only needs to put out the garbage once a week, not every hour. In  those terms, the attainment and maintenance of escape velocity simply means  that our best therapies must improve fast enough to outweigh the progressive  shift in the composition of our aging damage to more repair-resistant forms, as  the forms that are easier to repair are progressively eliminated by our  therapies. If we can do this, the total amount of damage in each category can  be kept permanently below the level that initiates functional decline.</p>
<p>              Another, perhaps simpler, way of looking at this is to consider the  <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> with literal escape velocity, i.e. the overcoming of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>. Suppose  you're at the top of a cliff and you jump off. Your remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy  is short&#8212;and it gets shorter as you descend to the rocks below. This is  exactly the same as with aging: the older you get, the less remaining time you  can expect to live. The situation with the periodic arrival of ever better  rejuvenation therapies is then a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> like jumping off a cliff with a jet-pack  on your back. Initially the jetpack is turned off, but as you fall, you turn it  on and it gives you a boost, slowing your fall. As you fall further, you turn  up the power on the jetpack, and eventually you start to pull out of the dive  and even start shooting upwards. And the further up you go, the easier it is to  go even further.</p>
<h2>The political and social significance of discussing LEV</h2>
<p>I've had a fairly difficult time convincing my colleagues in  biogerontology of the feasibility of the various SENS <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, but in  general I've been successful once I've been given enough time to go through the  details. When it comes to LEV, on the other hand, the reception to my proposals  can best be described as blank incomprehension. This is not too surprising, in  hindsight, because the LEV <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> is even further distant from the sort of  scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that my colleagues normally do than my other ideas are:  it's not only an area of science that's distant from mainstream gerontology,  it's not even science at all in the strict <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, but rather the history of  technology. But I regard that as no excuse. The fact is, the history of  technology is evidence, just like any other evidence, and scientists have no  right to ignore it.</p>
<p>              Another big reason for my colleagues' resistance to the LEV concept  is, of course, that if I'm seen to be right that achievement of LEV is  foreseeable, they can no longer go around saying that they're working on  postponing aging by a decade or two but no more. As I outlined in Chapter 13,  there is an intense fear within the senior gerontology community of being seen  as having anything to do with radical life extension, with all the  uncertainties that it will surely herald. They want nothing to do with such  talk.<br>
              You might think that my reaction to this would be to focus on the  short term: to avoid antagonising my colleagues with the LEV concept and its  implications of four-digit lifespans, in favour of increased emphasis on the  fine details of getting the SENS strands to work in a first-generation form.  But this is not an option for me, for one very simple and incontrovertible  reason: I'm in this business to save lives. In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to maximise the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of  lives saved&#8212;healthy years added to people's lives, if you'd prefer a more  precise measure&#8212;I need to address the whole picture. And that means ensuring  that you, dear reader&#8212;the general public&#8212;appreciate the importance of this  work enough to motivate its funding.</p>
<p>              Now, your first <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> may be: hang on, if indefinite life  extension is so unpalatable, wouldn't funding be attracted more easily by  keeping quiet about it? Well, no&#8212;and for a pretty good reason.</p>
<p>              The world's richest man, <a class="thought" href="entries/gates_entry.html">Bill Gates</a>, set up a foundation a few years  ago whose primary mission is to address health issues in the developing world.<sup><a name="ref2"></a><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>  This is a massively valuable humanitarian effort, which I wholeheartedly  support, even though it doesn't directly help SENS at all. I'm not the only  person who supports it, either: in 2006 the world's second richest man, Warren  Buffett, committed a large proportion of his fortune to be donated in annual  increments to the Gates Foundation.<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup><a name="ref3"></a></p>
<p>              The eagerness of extremely <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s to contribute to  world health is, in more general terms, an enormous boost for SENS. This is  mainly because a rising tide raises all boats: once it has become acceptable  (even meritorious) among that community to be seen as a large-scale health  philanthropist, those with "only" a billion or two to their name will be keener  to join the trend than if it is seen as a crazy way to spend your hard-earned  money.</p>
<p>              But there's a catch. That logic only works if the moral status of  SENS is seen to compare with that of the efforts that are now being funded so  well. And that's where LEV makes all the difference.</p>
<p>              SENS therapies will be expensive to develop and expensive to  administer, at least at first. Let's consider how the prospect of spending all  that money might be received if the ultimate benefit would be only to add a  couple of decades to the lives of people who are already living longer than  most in the developing world, after which those people would suffer the same  duration of functional decline that they do now.</p>
<p>              It's not exactly the world's most morally imperative <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, is it?</p>
<p>              Indeed, I would go so far as to say that, if I were in control of a  few billion dollars, I would be quite hesitant to spend it on such a marginal  improvement in the overall quality and quantity of life of those who are  already doing better in that respect than most, when the alternative exists of  making a similar or greater improvement to the quality and quantity of life of  the world's less fortunate inhabitants.</p>
<p>              The LEV concept doesn't make much difference in the short term to  who would benefit from these therapies, of course: it will necessarily be those  who currently die of aging, so in the first <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a> it will predominantly be  those in wealthy nations. But there is a very widespread appreciation in the  industrialised world&#8212;an appreciation that, I feel, extends to the wealthy  sectors of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>&#8212;that progress in the long term relies on aiming high, and  in particular that the moral imperative to help those at the rear of the field  to catch up is balanced by the moral imperative to maximise the average rate of  progress across the whole population, which initially means helping those who  are already ahead. The fact that SENS is likely to lead to LEV means that  developing SENS gives a huge boost to the quality and quantity of life of whomever  receives it: so huge, in fact, that there is no problem justifying it in  comparison the alternative uses to which a similar sum of money might be put.  The fact that lifespan is extended indefinitely rather than by only a couple of  decades is only part of the difference that LEV makes, of course: arguably an  even more important difference in terms of the benefit that SENS gives is that  the <em>whole</em> of that life will be  youthful, right up until a beneficiary mistimes the speed of an oncoming truck.  The average quality of life, therefore, will rise much more than if all that  was in prospect were a shift from (say) 7:1 to 9:1 in the ratio of healthy life  to frail life.</p>
<h2>Quantifying longevity escape velocity more precisely</h2>
<p>This chapter has, I hope, closed down the remaining escape routes  that might still have remained for those still seeking ways to defend a  rejection of the SENS agenda. I have shown that SENS can be functionally  equivalent to a way to eliminate aging completely, even though in actual therapeutic  terms it will only be able to postpone aging by a finite amount at any given  moment in time. I've also shown that this makes it morally just as desirable&#8212; imperative, even&#8212;as the many efforts into which a large amount of private  philanthropic funding is already being injected.</p>
<p>              I'm not complacent though: I know that people are quite ingenious  when it comes to finding ways to avoid combating aging. Thus, in order to keep  a few steps ahead, I have recently embarked on a collaboration with a  stupendous <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer and <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a> named Chris Phoenix, in which we are  determining the precise degree of healthy life extension that one can expect  from a given rate of progress in improving the SENS therapies. This is leading  to a series of publications highlighting a variety of scenarios, but the short  answer is that no wool has been pulled over your eyes above: the rate of  progress we need to achieve starts out at roughly a doubling of the efficacy of  the SENS therapies every 40 years and actually declines thereafter. By  "doubling of efficacy" I mean a halving of the amount of damage that still  cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>              So there you have it. We will almost  certainly take centuries to reach the level of control over aging that we have  over the aging of vintage cars&#8212;totally comprehensive, indefinite maintenance  of full function&#8212;but because longevity escape velocity is not very fast, we  will probably achieve something functionally equivalent within only a few  decades from now, at the point where we have therapies giving middle-aged  people 30 extra years of youthful life.</p>
<p>              I think we can call that the fountain of youth, don't you?<br>

              Aging</i></a> by Aubrey de Grey with Michael Rae, St. Martin's Press, 
              Sept. 4, 2007, ISBN: 0312367066</p>
<p><b>MUST WE AGE?<br>
</b><br>
              &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A long life in a healthy, vigorous, 
              youthful body has always been one of humanity&#8217;s greatest dreams. 
              Recent progress in genetic manipulations and calorie-restricted 
              diets in laboratory animals hold forth the promise that someday 
              science will enable us to exert total control over our own biological 
              aging.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nearly all scientists who study 
              the biology of aging agree that we will someday be able to substantially 
              slow down the aging process, extending our productive, youthful 
              lives. Dr. Aubrey de Grey is perhaps the most bullish of all such 
              researchers. As has been reported in media outlets ranging from 
              <em>60 Minutes</em> to <em>The New York Times,</em> Dr. de Grey 
              believes that the key biomedical technology required to eliminate 
              aging-derived debilitation and death entirely&#8212;technology that 
              would not only slow but periodically <em>reverse</em> age-related 
              physiological decay, leaving us biologically young into an indefinite 
              future&#8212;is now within reach.<br>
              &#160;<br>
              In <em>Ending Aging,</em> Dr. de Grey and his research assistant 
              Michael Rae describe the details of this biotechnology. They explain 
              that the aging of the human body, just like the aging of man-made 
              machines, results from an accumulation of various types of damage.&#160; 
              As with man-made machines, this damage can periodically be repaired, 
              leading to indefinite extension of the machine&#8217;s fully functional 
              lifetime, just as is routinely done with classic cars.&#160; We 
              already know what types of damage accumulate in the human body, 
              and we are moving rapidly toward the comprehensive development of 
              technologies to remove that damage.&#160; By demystifying aging 
              and its postponement for the nonspecialist reader, de Grey and Rae 
              systematically dismantle the fatalist presumption that aging will 
              forever defeat the efforts of medical science.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ending Aging is a great read - I'm halfway through.  I had this book preordered at Amazon and just got it earlier this week.  It is a great companion to Ray and Terry's "Fantastic Voyage..."  Over a year ago - registered <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162906/http://www.engineerednegligiblesenescence.com/" target="_blank">http://www.EngineeredNegligibleSenescence.com</a> and put up a website featuring information I had gathered about Aubrey de Grey, and other information about the anti-aging movement.  The website is for the lay person - in hopes to start understanding the anti-aging movement.  I believe what de Grey says that when we first publicize our success at lengthening a mouse's years significantly - the movement will gain steam, financing, and we'll be off to greatly increased human lifespans!

<br>
<br>
Aubrey de Grey, I think, is talking about the consequences of applying the 'Methusula mouse' treatments to human beings. These biotech treatments will slow down the cummulative damage that underlies aging, but will not be comprehensive enough to halt it completely. Therefore, using such biotech interventions we only delay senesence, rather than avoid it all together.
<br>
<br>
However, in 'Fantastic Future', Kurzweil and Grossman point out that the stuff de Grey is talking about represents the second bridge of a three-bridge approach to achieveing indefinite lifespans.
<br>
<br>
Bridge One: Eat your greens, do your exercises...do whatever is practical to maintain your health so that the much more effective senesence-slowing treatments now starting to work on mice are perfected for human use in time to be useful to you.
<br>
<br>
Bridge two: The far more effective treatments stemming from a more thorough understanding of the molecular underpinnings of aging slow down the aging process still further, hopefully enough to get you to a world where the (now) almost entirely theoretical design work of nanosurgery (as depicted in the multi-volume works of Rob Frietas) finally emerges from vapourware and enters the market.
<br>
<br>
Bridge three: Molecular nanotechnology redesigns the human animal from the subcellular level, upwards, going vastly beyond the suboptimal designs biology is limited to.
<br>
<br>
I should point out that De Grey's vision does not agree with Kurzweil and Grossman's. The latter two believe that Bridge three will be constructed only decades after bridge two is complete. However, de Grey cautions
<br>
<br>
"We will almost certainly take centuries to reach the level of control over aging that we have over the aging of vintage cars'totally comprehensive, indefinite maintenance of full function'but because longevity escape velocity is not very fast, we will probably achieve something functionally equivalent within only a few decades from now, at the point where we have therapies giving middle-aged people 30 extra years of youthful life."
<br>
<br>
I suppose Kurzweil would call that falling foul of 'inuitive linear belief', which ignores the double exponential curve technological growth. Or maybe de Grey is the realist and Messers K and G are pie-in-the-sky optimists?</p></td>

However considering your age, I think it's very likely you will live longer than even our sun, however by that point whatever living thing there is that was derived from you won't be much at all like you. Death is progressive in this sense, the 5 year old me has all but died at this point for example. We're so worried about death yet our current self is slowly dying over time. An instant death is merely a significant jump in the process.

<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> ND WHAT IS UR OPINION ON CRYONICS???????? </p></center> I don't care much for it. I say if you're dead, leave it be. Dead people don't care about cryonics. Although it's going to be an interesting experience for these frozen folks one day suddenly waking up in a different universe after what only felt like one night's sleep. I could certainly see offing myself to effectively jump to the future without the boring intermediate biological existence. It would sure make life a whole lot easier. But I don't think I'm going to pussy out on life like this. If we all did it, there wouldn't be anyone left to get us there.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Really, the most sensible course of action is to take every sensible step to live a healthy lifestyle. Kurzweil and Grosmman's book 'Fantastic Voyage' is actually a pretty excellent and thorough study of the steps one can take right now to maximise a lifespan. Critics like to mock that it is the 'take 200 pills per day' diet, which is a trifle unfair given the sheer wealth of information it contains about exactly why some foods are good while others are bad, and how exercise can greatly benefit us, plus the fact the book is written to take advantage of the upcoming genomics revolution, where we will gain an ability to understand our genetic deficiencies and tailor a dietry/drugs regime to effectively combat it.
<br>
<br>
The book also contains a lot of references to the R+D being undertaken to combat the diseases of aging. The good news is that it is now widely accepted that the aging process can indeed be interrupted. The bad news is that the process by which such drugs make it onto the market is a painstakingly slow one, and one can well imagine such 'lifestyle' treatments costing enormous sums of money (regardless of how cheap they may be to actually produce) because people are known to part with mucho cash for elixers of youth.
<br>
<br>
As for cryogenics, last time I checked it cost $50,000 just to get your head frozen (if you want to preserve your body that costs $120,000). 
<br>
<br>
If you have a top-class insurance policy that would cover the cost, or have tens of thousands of dollars stashed somewhere, then cryonics is certainly an option. </p></td>

<br>
If I defined living as maintaining consciousness within some form of existence ( = some form of "physical" support for consciousness)it is hard, in my opinion, to be reasonably sure that eventually we will run out of such vehicles for consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I guess that you are considering the limitation in time of the universe or of its properties when you state that death is certain.
<br>
<br>
At such extremes any and all predictions are equal in value therefore I believe it to be more relevant that prediction that satisfies our desires, the optimistic ones.
<br>
<br>
Since we create technology to control the universe it is consceivable that a few billion years in the future conscious life will have the chance to create technology that will allow it to overcome the problem of the end of this universe, either by finding a solution to entropy or by creating or moving into an appropriate new universe, capable of supporting conscious life.
<br>
<br>
At least this should be the logical goal and there is no definitive proof that it will be impossible.</p></td>

Rather suprised to see Nano-one make a bullshit statement such as this. It is a matter of historical fact that definitions of 'death' have had to be redefined in the face of new medical technologies. They used to think a lack of pulse was death, whereas nowadays its a sign you should start applying CPR. Lack of brain activity is currently the sure sign that you have gone beyond contemporary medical help, but the whole point of cryonics is to preserve your body and brain until subcellular repair is perfected.</p></td>

Anyways, as I said, I don't care much for it. I know these people can be revived, don't get me wrong, but I personally wouldn't feel comfortable burdening society with my upkeep during which period I would be contributing nothing in return. The way I see it, there's really no good reason for me to make it to the 'singularity' as such because billions of other people will on their own time. There's nothing special about me that would justify such a burden. This I feel would reflect on just about anyone else whom is 'freezable', with the exception of perhaps a select few individuals that could be expected to continue to make substantial contributions far above that of the average person even post their revival. Death as I see it should not be something that must be prevented at all cost, as you probably know from my postings.
<br>
<br>
Not that I'm absolutely against the idea, I'm in the gray area when it comes to justifiability. I don't condemn it, I just don't favor it either. My position on the matter is likely to change eventually, whether for one side or the other. Right now it's simply unclear.</p></td>

CAUSE EVEN THOUGH OUR MEMORIES ARE SAVED WE MITE BE LONG GONE.               So what im getting at is that we cant for sure explain anything about this world that we live in or how we came here.      and we dont know what happens after death untill we actually die,but we dont want to take that chance and see because if we do and we are dead for sure then we have 0% of coming back.                      we dont know if cryonics can bring us back even though i realy think we cant.            BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IF WE MAKE THE TREATMENTS FOR IMMORTALITY WILE WE ARE ALIVE THEN WE KNOW WE CAN LIVE FOREVER BECAUSE WE DIDNT DIE.                    AND WE DONT HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS UNIVERSE TO BE HAPPY AND GET WHAT WE WANT,WE JUST NEED TO DISCOVER WHAT WE NEED TO DISCOVER......AND TO ALL YOU CHRISTIANS OUT THERE,IT REALY DOESENT MATTER IF GOD EXISTS OR NOT,PHYSICAL IMMORTALITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SIN EVEN IF GOD DID EXIST BECAUSE IT IS JUST ANOTHER TECKNOLOGY ADANCEMENT IN HEALTH AND LIKE NANOSTUFF SAID..........EVEN IF WE DONT LIVE FOREVER,WE CAN STRETCH THE HUMAN LIFE SPAN SO MUCH THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IMMORTALITY.                                                                                                                                                                      AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT IF ANY SCIENTISTS ARE READING THIS,PLEASE KEEP TRYING TO MAKE US IMMORTAL BECAUSE YOU KNOW...............IF OUR LIFE WASENT ON THE LINE CAUSE OF IT THEN WE WOULDNT BE IN SUCH NEED TO HAVE IT RITE AWAY!!!!!!

I think I also remember Ray talking same solution.

This option will probably be for the people who would like to remain in human form, but there is a posibility that most would prefer the virtual way of life without a biological body.</p></td>

Perpetual cloning and wetware transfer seems like a narrow minded conclusion to be drawn from technological progress. It's analogous to suggesting we will breed bigger and faster horses never considering the automobile as an obvious and superior alternative.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Has anyone here checked out the near death studies being done? Extemely fascinating research has been done that reveals a far more fascinating experience beyond this poor mortal existence. Research done in a purely scientific way is difficult because of the nature of the phenomonen, but they have been able to do some statistical work as well as verification of some of the experiences that patients had when they were supposed to be in a coma or dead.
<br>
<br>
If the stories many people have told around the world and throughout history are to be believed, we could actually be cheating ourselves by keeping ourselves here in this plane of existence for a much longer time than was originally intended. It hardly matters though. If there is such a thing as a soul that survives after physical death that lasts forever, then what is 10,000 years to infinity? No more and no less than a day.
<br>
<br>
To the 14-year old who is afraid of dying, check out some of the research being done in this field at www.near-death.com and www.iands.com. It seems that either way, radical life-exension or actual life after death, we're all covered for eternal life.

<br>
Today, technology already exists for people who wish to extend their life expectancy by 20 years above the average life expectancy.
<br>
<br>
Maybe these 20 years will buy us sufficient time for phase two.
<br>
<br>
Here is how it can be done:
<br>
- Specifically designed diet. (Optimal amount of calories, + vitamin and  other type of supplements)
<br>
- Physical activity.
<br>
- Mental activity.
<br>
- Getting sufficient sleep.
<br>
- Reduce stress (That can be archive by lifestyle and meditation)
<br>
- Avoid hazardous habits (Such as smoking, extreme sport, and others)
<br>
<br>
Most people, I predict, will not take these steps.  Not even if it means potentially becoming immortals.
<br>
<br>
Check this Life Expectancy Calculator

<br>
<br>
I discovered that I can easily add 9 years to my life expectancy just by adjusting my diet.

That didn't take account of loads of stuff and is no more than a party game.

There's cryonics, an also it's pretty likely future technology will develop quantum archeology and resurrect the dead. This isn't wishful ideas, there is no reason why you cant configure the patterns for people's long gone memeories based on massive probability calculations with the variables future superintelligence would be able to access.

THat sort of calculation is so vast for us to comprehend most never entertain that it is possible, because they couldn't BEGIN to think about it.
