<div class="TeaserText">Nanorobotic "microbivores" traveling in the bloodstream could be 1000 times faster-acting than white blood cells and eradicate 1000 times more bacteria, offering a complete antimicrobial therapy without increasing the risk of sepsis or septic shock (as in traditional antibiotic regimens) and without release of biologically active effluents. They could also quickly rid the blood of nonbacterial pathogens such as viruses, fungus cells, or parasites.</div>

<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a> [1] offers the prospect of powerful new tools for 
              the treatment of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Diamondoid-based medical nanorobotics may offer substantial 
              improvements in capabilities over natural <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, exceeding 
              even the improvements possible via tissue <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>. 
              For example, the respirocytes [2] - artificial red blood cells comprised 
              of microscopic diamondoid pressure tanks that are operated at up 
              to 1000 atm of pressure - could carry &gt;200 times more respiratory 
              gases than an equal volume of natural red blood cells. The clottocytes 
              [3] are artificial platelets that could stop <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bleeding within 
              ~1 second of physical injury, but using only 0.01% the bloodstream 
              concentration of natural platelets - in other words, nanorobotic 
              clottocytes would be ~10,000 times more effective as clotting agents 
              than an equal volume of natural platelets.</p>
<p>In this article I'd like to examine the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> nanorobotic equivalent 
              of the third major class of natural blood cells - the white cells. 
              This paper summarizes the results of a recently completed scaling 
              study of artificial mechanical phagocytes of microscopic size, called 
              "microbivores." Microbivores constitute a potentially 
              large class of medical nanorobots intended to be deployed in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              patients for a wide variety of antimicrobial therapeutic purposes, 
              for example, as a first-line response to septicemia. The analysis 
              focuses on a relatively simple <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>: an intravenous (I.V.) microbivore 
              whose primary function is to destroy microbiological <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s found 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bloodstream, using the "digest and discharge" 
              protocol first described by the author elsewhere [1]. The full technical 
              paper describing the microbivore scaling design study is already 
              available online [4].</p>
<p>Septicemia, also known as blood poisoning, is the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>ic 
              microorganisms in the blood. If allowed to <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, these microorganisms 
              can multiply and cause an overwhelming infection. Bacteremia is 
              the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bloodstream. Although <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l 
              nutrients are plentiful in blood, the healthy <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bloodstream 
              is generally considered a sterile environment. Major antimicrobial 
              defenses include the circulating neutrophils and monocytes (white 
              cells) capable of phagocytosis (engulfing and digesting other cells) 
              and the supporting <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of humoral immunity including complement 
              and immunoglobulins.</p>
<p>Still, it is not unusual to find a few <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> in blood. Normal 
              activities like chewing, brushing or flossing teeth causes movement 
              of teeth in their sockets, infusing a burst of commensal oral microbes 
              into the bloodstream [5]. <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">Bacteria</a> can enter the blood via an injury 
              to the skin, the lining of the mouth or gums, or from gingivitis 
              and other minor infections in the skin and elsewhere [6]. <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">Bacteria</a> 
              can also enter the blood during surgical, dental, or other medical 
              procedures such as the insertion of I.V. lines (providing fluids, 
              nutrition or medications), cystoscopy (a viewing tube inserted to 
              examine the bladder), colonoscopy (a viewing tube inserted to view 
              the colon), or heart valve replacement with a prosthetic [6]. Such 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> are normally removed by circulating leukocytes (along with 
              fixed reticuloendothelial phagocytes in the spleen, liver, and lungs), 
              but a few <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> are unusually virulent and can overwhelm 
              the natural defenses. The Center for <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">Disease</a> Control estimates that 
              ~25,000 U.S. patients die each year from <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l sepsis. Current 
              therapies often involve multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s administered simultaneously 
              in multi-gram quantities per day. These treatments can sometimes 
              take weeks or even months to bring under control certain hardy infectious 
              microorganisms like <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> or enterobacteria 
              such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i>.</p>
<p>A nanorobotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that could safely provide quick and complete 
              eradication of bloodborne <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s using relatively low doses of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s would be a welcome addition to the physician's therapeutic 
              armamentarium. Such a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is the microbivore, an artificial 
              mechanical phagocyte.</p>
<p>The microbivore is an oblate spheroidal nanomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> consisting 
              of 610 billion precisely arranged structural atoms plus another 
              ~150 billion mostly gas or water <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s when fully loaded. The 
              nanorobot measures 3.4 microns in diameter along its major axis 
              and 2.0 microns in diameter along its minor axis, thus ensuring 
              ready passage through even the narrowest of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capillaries which 
              are ~4 microns in diameter [1]. Its gross geometric volume of 12.1056 
              micron<sup>3</sup> includes two normally empty internal materials processing 
              chambers totalling 4 micron<sup>3</sup> in displaced volume. The nanodevice 
              consumes 100-200 pW of continuous power while in <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> and can 
              completely digest trapped microbes at a maximum throughput of 2 
              micron<sup>3</sup> per 30-second cycle, large enough to internalize a single 
              microbe from virtually any major bacteremic <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> in a single 
              gulp. As in previous designs [2], to help ensure high reliability 
              the microbivore has tenfold redundancy in all major <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, 
              excluding only the largest passive structural <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. The microbivore 
              has a dry mass of 12.2 picograms.</p>
<p>Here's how the nanorobot works. During each cycle of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>, 
              the target bacterium is bound to the surface of the microbivore 
              like a fly on flypaper, via <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>-specific reversible binding 
              sites [1]. Telescoping robotic grapples emerge from silos in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> surface, establish secure anchorage to the microbe's plasma 
              membrane, then transport the <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a> to the ingestion <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a> at the 
              front of the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> where the <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> is internalized into 
              a 2 micron<sup>3</sup> morcellation chamber. After sufficient mechanical mincing, 
              the morcellated remains of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> are pistoned into a 2 micron<sup>3</sup> 
              digestion chamber where a preprogrammed sequence of 40 <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered 
              enzymes are successively injected and extracted six times, <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ively 
              reducing the morcellate ultimately to monoresidue amino acids, mononucleotides, 
              glycerol, free fatty acids and simple sugars. These simple <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s 
              are then harmlessly discharged back into the bloodstream through 
              an exhaust <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a> at the rear of the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, completing the 30-second 
              digestion cycle. This "digest and discharge" protocol 
              [1] is <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ually similar to the internalization and digestion 
              process practiced by natural phagocytes, except that the artificial 
              process should be much faster and cleaner. For example, it is well 
              known that macrophages release <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly active compounds during 
              bacteriophagy [7], whereas well-designed microbivores need only 
              release <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly inactive effluent.</p>
<p>Natural phagocytic cells are 100-1000 times larger in volume than 
              microbivores but may consume almost as much power during comparable 
              activities. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, heat production rises from 9 pW in unstimulated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> neutrophils up to 28 pW during phagocytosis, with the rise 
              proportional to the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s ingested [8]. The basal 
              rate for a resting ~400 micron<sup>3</sup> T-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> lymphocyte is ~20 pW, rising 
              to ~65 pW during antigen response [9].</p>
<p>Microbe ingestion times for natural professional phagocytes can 
              be quite rapid, often a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of minutes, but full digestion and 
              excretion of the target <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a> may require hours. While macrophages 
              can ingest up to ~25% of their volume per hour [10], microbivores 
              can process ~2000% of their volume per hour, thus are ~80 times 
              more efficient as phagocytic agents. In other words, a given volume 
              of microbivores can digest <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s 80 times faster than 
              an equal volume of white cells or macrophages could digest them.</p>
<p>Many natural professional phagocytic cells such as neutrophils 
              also have a maximum <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for phagocytosis during their short 
              lifetime, typically a few hours in blood or a few days in tissue. 
              In one <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> [11], 1-100 <i>S. aureus</i> or <i>S. faecalis</i>
<a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> were presented to each neutrophil, which digested more 
              of them at the higher concentrations. At the highest concentration 
              (100:1), neutrophils from normal patients could only kill a mean 
              of 9 <i>S. aureus</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> per phagocyte, while neutrophils 
              from carriers of chronic granulomatous <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> could kill a mean 
              of 14 <i>S. faecalis</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> per phagocyte. By comparison, 
              a single microbivore could completely digest up to ~3000 microbes/day 
              of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> with no well-defined maximum lifetime 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for phagocytosis.</p>
<p>In the accompanying technical paper [4] a simple mathematical model 
              for microbivore pharmacokinetics quantifies the activity of a specific 
              dose of nanorobots injected into the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> bloodstream, with the 
              conclusion that a 1-terabot (10<sup>12</sup>-<a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>) dose of microbivores 
              employed in the treatment of a mild bacteremia (0.1 x 10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming 
              units (CFU) per ml) can reduce the initial whole-bloodstream <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l 
              load of 5.4 x 10<sup>8</sup> CFU down to &lt;1 CFU in 460-5400 sec (8-90 min), 
              if 1-10 bacterium-microbivore collisions are required for the bacterium 
              to stick.</p>
<p>Similarly, a severe bacteremia (100 x 106 CFU/ml) is eliminated 
              in 620-7300 sec (10-120 min). Note that a single 1-terabot intravenous 
              dose (a ~12 cm<sup>3</sup> injection) of microbivores produces a nanocrit 
              of Nct ~ 0.2% in the blood of a normal adult <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> patient 
              and could liberate up to 100-200 watts of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>ic waste heat which 
              is very near the maximum thermogenic limit for in vivo medical nanorobot 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s [1].</p>
<p>While microbivores can fully eliminate septicemic infections in 
              minutes to hours, natural phagocytic defenses - even when aided 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s - can often require weeks or months to achieve complete 
              clearance of target <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> from the bloodstream. Thus microbivores 
              appear to be up to ~1000 times faster-acting than either unaided 
              natural or <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>-assisted <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> phagocytic defenses.</p>
<p>Another useful comparative perspective is that the administration 
              of antibacterial agents (e.g., against <i>E. coli</i>) typically 
              may increase the LD50 of that <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a> by ~500-fold using <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s 
              [12] or ~850-fold using monoclonal antibodies [13]. For example, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian LD50 for <i>E. coli</i> is ~0.1-1 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml, rising 
              to ~10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml with the administration of <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s. By employing 
              a suitable dose of microbivores, a bloodstream <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l concentration 
              up to the theoretical maximum of ~10<sup>11</sup> CFU/ml (~20% of blood volume 
              assuming ~2 micron<sup>3</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s) could be controlled, bringing another 
              ~1000-fold improvement using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> and at last extending 
              the therapeutic competence of the physician to the entire range 
              of potential <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l threats, including locally dense infections.</p>
<p>With minor additions to the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> design, microbivores could be 
              used to combat toxemia, the distribution throughout the body of 
              poisonous products of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> growing in a focal or local site, 
              and other biochemical sequelae of sepsis. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, <i>E. coli</i>-induced 
              septicemic shock in vervet monkeys occurred at 425 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin rose from normal 
              at 0.076 ng/ml to a maximum of 1.130 ng/ml blood concentration [14]. 
              In another study, endotoxin levels during a gram-negative <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l 
              infection rose from 0.2 to 2 ng/ml in pig blood [15]. Eliminating 
              a bloodstream concentration of ~2 ng/ml of ~8 kDa LPS endotoxin 
              [16] would require the extraction and enzymatic digestion of ~8 
              x 10<sup>14</sup> LPS <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from the ~5400 cm3 <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> blood compartment, 
              a mere ~800 LPS <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s per nanorobot assuming a 1-terabot dose 
              of modified microbivores.</p>
<p>The high <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> (up to 30%-50%) associated with gram-negative 
              sepsis is due in large measure to the patient's reaction to LPS, 
              an endotoxin which induces the production of cytokines such as IL-1beta 
              and IL-6 which leads to an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction resulting 
              in tissue damage and organ failure [17]. We've already noted that 
              small quantities (~ng/ml) of LPS are released by living and growing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, but the killing of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> using traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a> 
              regimens often liberates large quantities of additional LPS, potentially 
              up to ~10<sup>5</sup> ng/ml [17]. Such massive releases as occur with the 
              use of <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s will not accompany the use of microbivores, because 
              all <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s (including all <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-wall LPS) are internalized 
              and fully digested into harmless nonantigenic <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s prior to 
              discharge from the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Microbivores thus represent a complete 
              antimicrobial therapy without increasing the risk of sepsis or septic 
              shock.</p>
<p>If the patient presents with a septic condition before the microbivores 
              are introduced, a substantial preexisting concentration of inflammatory 
              cytokines will likely be present and must be extracted from the 
              blood in concert with the primary antibacterial microbivore treatment. 
              All unwanted cytokine <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s may be rapidly and <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>ically 
              extracted from the blood using a modest dose of respirocyte-class 
              nanodevices [2] such as pharmacytes [1], a combination-treatment 
              approach previously suggested elsewhere [1, 18]. Specifically, a 
              1-terabot intravenous dose of micron-size pharmacytes [1] each having 
              ~10<sup>5</sup> cytokine-specific molecular sorting rotors and ~0.5 micron<sup>3</sup> 
              of onboard storage <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> could reduce the blood concentration 
              of ~20 kDa IL-1beta and IL-6 cytokines from LPS-elevated levels 
              of ~100 ng/ml [210] (~3 x 10<sup>-9</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s/nm<sup>3</sup>) down to normal serum 
              levels of ~10 pg/ml [211] (~3 x 10<sup>-13</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s/nm<sup>3</sup>) after only 
              ~200 sec of diffusion-limited pumping, using just ~0.1% of the available 
              onboard storage volume. (Extracting an additional ~10<sup>5</sup> ng/ml of 
              LPS from the bloodstream would take a similar amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and 
              use ~100% of the available onboard storage volume.)</p>
<p>Microbivores could also be useful for treating infections of the 
              meninges or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and respiratory <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s 
              involving the presence of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> in the lungs or sputum, and could 
              also digest <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l biofilms. These handy nanorobots could quickly 
              rid the blood of nonbacterial <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s such as viruses (viremia), 
              fungus cells (fungemia), or parasites (parasitemia). Outside the 
              body, microbivore derivatives could help clean up biohazards, toxic 
              biochemicals or other environmental organic materials spills, as 
              in bioremediation.</p>
