<div class="TeaserText">At the 2002 AAAS <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> Seminar, leading nanotechnologists presented the building blocks that may overturn current manufacturing processes on a collision course with Moore's Law.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published February 21, 2002 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p> "The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of computing may not be focused on <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> so much as fabrication," said MIT Professor <a class="thought" href="entries/gershenfeld_entry.html">Neil Gershenfeld</a>, reflecting a common theme at the seminar: building computers from the bottom up and using novel strata will enable Moore's 1<sup>st</sup> law (chip speed is doubling every 18 months) to continue far into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, while defeating the cost-doubling of chip manufacturing plants that occurs every three years--Moore's less-popular 2<sup>nd</sup> law.</p><h1>Advances in Nanoelectronics</h1><p>According to Dr. James Ellenbogen of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225171949/http://www.mitre.org/research/nanotech/index.html" target="_new">MITRE Nanosystems Group</a>, the advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in the final months of 2001 were like "living <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>...every other week something new was happening." He pointed out that two of the most important obstacles facing molecular-scale electronics are achieving signal amplification using molecular devices (basically, wiring them in a stable fashion) and building logic circuits using molecular or nanoscale devices--thus using them for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage.</p>
<p>Five <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> groups achieved these gains in Fall 2001 with different approaches (see "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225171949/http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html?id%253D819" target="_new">New world of nanoelectronics may arrive in the near future, AAAS speakers say</a>").</p>
<p>Dr. Charles Leiber of Harvard University has created what he calls "a damn good <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>" using nanowires. Because of their semiconducting properties, he believes they'e the best candidate for a fundamental building block. The cross-<a class="thought" href="entries/nanowire_entry.html">nanowire</a> field effect <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> that his group created from nanowires could be used as <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> sensors or scaled up to form a computing <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> without the need for <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>--quite possibly in three dimensions.</p>
<p>What these groups have in common is that they have achieved real results in manipulating electrons at a nanoscale to create reliable <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> devices. Although, as Professor Mark Ratner of Northwestern University pointed out, "the interconnects aren't there yet," these devices form an arsenal of building blocks for constructingscalable architectures. Instead of crunching components onto <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>, smart devices will be constructed from the bottom-up--achieving levels of precision in manufacturing at an atomic level, as opposed to the conventional top-down approach of etching features onto <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge is to begin putting devices together--a challenge that is overcome when, as Leiber said, "the same intellectual underpinnings are required when working with these building blocks, whether for bionanotechnology or <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>."</p>
<p>In his keynote, Leiber also spoke of the creation of NOR gates--a programmable logic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>--using <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, another key building block. Professor Cees Dekker of TU Delft used semiconducting <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> to build a single <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> that operates a room temperature. "Four years ago,we barely observed current through <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>," Dekker said. "Now, we have controlled transistors, semiconduction, working circuits." For Dekker, the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is in the merger of inorganic clusters of computable <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> with "<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> routines and material, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>."</p>
<p>Dr. Hendrik Schoen of <a class="thought" href="entries/bell_labs_entry.html">Bell Labs</a>/<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225171949/http://www.lucent.com/minds/transistor/molecular/" target="_new">Lucent Technologies</a> has demonstrated a compromise between the top-down world of conventional chip lithography and bottom-up nanomanufacturing. Schoen's approach is to grow layers of conductive molecules--"monolayers"--on <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> using interactions between gold molecules and thiols. This layer can operate as multiple transistors of molecules. The cost savings is clear--as Schoen put it, "no cleanroom, no lithography...[is required] to create <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> on a molecular scale."</p><h1>New Paradigms</h1><p>In a talk entitled "The Problem Before Us," James Crutchfield of the Sante Fe Institute opened the AAAS New Computing seminar by citing Moore's 2<sup>nd</sup> Law (the cost of conventional chip fabrication plants doubles every three years) and then asking the question, "what kind of intrinsic processes do natural systems use to store <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>?"</p>
<p>By turning away from the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of computing introduced by <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>--that all problems can be solved using the logic that forms the basis of modern computing--we may find more flexible, complex and far less expensive methods of computing in naturally occurring phenomena, according to Crutchfield. Instead of Turing Machines, he proposes a new class of theoretical machines called Epsilon Machines, which emulate the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> or symmetrical neuronal firing in the human brain.</p>
<p>How do you measure global <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> among neurons, asks Crutchfield? By representing the parallel connections between neurons with "causal states." Beginning with a 1 for a synchronized cluster of neurons and a 0 for a non-synchronized cluster, we have the roots for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage. "This forms intrinsic <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>: models of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> engineering can build on," said Crutchfield.</p>
<p>Crutchfield's basic thesis is that these systems abound in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> around us. To harness their informational power, one must ask three questions: how much <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> does the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> inherently have, how is it organized, and how does it produce further behavior? <a class="thought" href="entries/gershenfeld_entry.html">Neil Gershenfeld</a> followed this reasoning in a presentation that featured oddities ranging from printable bicycles to an <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a> engineered for a parrot (The Interpet Explorer): to "ask <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> to solve a problem instead of building a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to do it."</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/gershenfeld_entry.html">Neil Gershenfeld</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/mit_medialab_entry.html">MIT Media Lab</a> Professor and author of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050225171949/http://www.media.mit.edu/physics/publications/books/ba/" target="_new">When Things Start To Think</a>, spoke of bringing "ideas out of the box and into the world" with new methods of fabrication. Computational power will not be as important in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> as the ease and speed of producing computational devices. Gershenfeld spoke about allowing common objects in the physical world to take on <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and, perhaps more importantly, bringing computing to developing countries in novel ways--to people who need computing "first and most urgently."</p>
<p>Examples? A liquid that stores <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and can be used as paint, bringing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to walls. Reconfigurable ink that not only creates new methods of displaying <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> but can hold <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, forming "printable computers." By discovering and creating applications with "emergent multi-hop networks" and other programmable characteristics within existing physical materials, Gershenfeld feels that we will realize "more profound consequences than just creating faster computers."</p>
<p>He points out a dramatic reversal of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> divide that may occur if those without computers obtain the most advanced computational technologies and supersede the comparatively slow pace of the standard, desktop-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-literate world.</p>
<p>MIT's "Hole in the Wall" project documented the lightning speed in which children in a New Delhi slum learned <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> navigation and even advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word features on a laptop placed randomly before them--through a hole in the wall of an MIT lab out into the street. Within a month, they were organizing classes to instruct each other. Conflict didn't occur because "Instead of haves and have-nots, there were knows and know-nots," and, as Gershenfeld pointed out, "this is preventing war in a different way than using <a class="thought" href="entries/biometrics_entry.html">biometrics</a> to catch terrorists."</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>     The implications inherent in this exciting new field of human inquiry astonishes and refreshes my soul. It also gives me the creeps!
<br>
     My teacher taught that politics and religon are two wings of the same bird. " We all know," he would say, " That a one winged bird can't get off the ground. An if it could it would only fly in circles."
<br>
     We are two winged birds. We presently only have one wing flapping, and if we do not wake up and exercise the other wing now, we are headed for the wall.
<br>
     The present choices being made by 'mad scientists' in the name of progress is inherently a politico/commercial race toward more of the same. This persual will require the same element which is so desperately needed throughout human society: namely, spiritual guidance. 
<br>
     All indigenous wisdom and prophesy indicates that at this time in our evolution we have unprecedented access to this guidance.
<br>
     Scientists recently discovered that the cellular tissue in the human heart has 85% the syntactical ability of the braincells. There is a moral to this story. Our brain's wing is overloaded with information while our heartwing is lonely and illiterate. The overload of information requires the assistance of discernment, a sacred practice almost lost to modern man. That's why there is no course in our children's schools on how to live a good life.  What good is all the information if it never arrives at showing us the way?
<br>
     I have a proposal that I am hoping you will steal so I don't have to do all the work of a prototype alone. How about assembling a curriculum and membership for a modern Mystery School? The purpose for such in the past wwas always to facilitate transformation in times of change. We could have a diverse membership in order to build a 'Very Large Array (VLA)' for listening to God. Specific questions could be submitted by scientists, politicians, theologians, educators, ang thinkers without monikers. 
<br>
     Any takers?</p></td>
