<div class="TeaserText">The coming elimination of the barrier between living and nonliving materials will lead to "animats" (living materials) -- nanobiotechnology devices that can survive and function inside human beings, derive energy from biological metabolism, and copy themselves by molecular self-assembly. When that moment happens, it very likely may be beyond our control....</div>

<p>Don't call me Ishmael, for I am not a survivor. Don't call me Cassandra 
              either, since some might believe what I foretell. Perhaps I am the 
              final manifestation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> ignited in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_Gorge" target="_blank">Olduvi 
              Gorge</a> a million and a half years ago. The flame that has grown 
              to consume our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> and send sparks into outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. The singularity 
              that started as an ineffable, ineluctable pulse resonating through 
              the neural <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis" target="_blank">Homo 
              habilis</a>. A voice that said, You whoever you are, You must sharpen 
              that stone, pick up that bone, cross that line. A voice of supreme 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>; one that simultaneously makes us uniquely <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, yet is 
              itself not human. Nor is it the black <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> monolith 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/kubrick_entry.html">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s imagining. Rather, it was always here. Hard-<a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> 
              into us at the atomic level&#8212;and we into it. A voice whose physical 
              manifestation, the tool, sang its song millions of years before 
              human beings walked the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>. This voice prophesied and then enabled 
              our coming. It will instruct us in our going. Or so I say, while 
              understanding too well that in the 21<sup>st</sup> century we are all jaded 
              and stultified with sensory overload. It's always the end of the 
              world as we know it&#8212;and we feel bored. </p>
<p>So why listen to the voice of one who is not Ishmael, not Cassandra, 
              not even Ralph Nader? Because I can tell you something that no one 
              else can. I can tell you the exact moment when <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> will 
              cease to exist. And I can tell you how the end will come. I can 
              show you the exact design of the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that will bring us down. 
              I can reveal the blueprint, provide the precise technical specifications. 
              Long before we can melt the polar ice caps, or denude the rain forests, 
              or colonize the moon, we will be gone. And we will not&#8212;definitely 
              will not&#8212;end with a bang or a whimper. The human race will 
              go to its <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> in a state of supreme exaltation, like an actor 
              climbing the stairs to accept an Academy Award. We will exit the

<p>The usual suspects&#8212;those who have become known for predicting

              it. Mainly because they don't understand what the definition of 
              "it" is. They don't realize what evolution is. They have 
              come to the problem from <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s analysis,

              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0134.html?printable=1" target="_top">Ray 
              Kurzweil</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.salon.com/tech/view/2000/04/10/joy/" target="_top">Bill 
              Joy</a> and Eric Drexler have raised some alarms, but they are too 
              dazzled by the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and power of human cybersystems, devices 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s to see it coming. They think the power of our tools 
              lies in their ever-increasing complexity&#8212;but they are wrong. 
              The biotech folks just don't get it either. People like Craig Venter 
              and Leroy Hood are too enthralled with the possibilities inherent 
              in engineering <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> to get it. And our "bioethicists," 
              like Arthur Kaplan, and those who cling to their human <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> like 
              it was the <a class="thought" href="entries/holy_grail_entry.html">Holy Grail</a> or the original tablets of stone, blathering 
              on like Captain Kirk about what special, sacred things we humans 
              are&#8212;they can't possibly get it. All these people who think 
              (or fear) that technology will ultimately trump biology have missed 
              the cosmic point. They are not even wrong. To begin to get it, one 
              must dispense with artificial boundaries. If you are only thinking 
              about cybersystems and DNA you can&#8217;t possibly get it. And if 
              you are thinking outside the box, you are still thinking too much 
              like a human being.</p>
<p>Linus Pauling would have gotten it right away. Erwin Schr&#246;dinger 
              too, and probably Robert Oppenheimer. Bertrand Russell got it. In 
              fact he named it. What Ray, and Craig, and Eric, and Arthur can't 
              see is the power of pure <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>&#8212;what Bertrand Russell called 
              "chemical imperialism." What they don't get is this&#8212; 
              a system does not have to be complex to be transcendently, transformatively 
              powerful. After all, we and everything we have created are nothing 
              but the product of "carbon imperialism"&#8212;carbon being 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> that all known <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is based on. Nothing but the power 
              of pure chemistry. Living and nonliving materials, everything that 
              exists in the physical world of our <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> burns with that same 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> fire. The fire of the chemical bond.</p>
<p>And Prometheus has returned. His new screen name is nanobiotechnology.</p>
<p>Quick. What's the difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> and synthetic 
              biology? Don't know? Neither does anyone else, but that isn't stopping 
              nanobiotechnology <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers from building them&#8212;or it, or 
              that, or whatever. To stay up to speed, there is always Artificial 
              Life, the official journal of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&amp;tid=41" target="_blank">International 
              Society of Artificial Life</a>. According to the editors, the humble 
              mission of the journal "is [to investigate] the scientific, 
              engineering, philosophical, and social issues involved in our rapidly 
              increasing technological ability to synthesize life-like behaviors 
              from scratch in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, and other alternative 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>." Whoa!</p>
<p>The federal <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> is in the game big-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as well. For example, 
              the Physical Biosciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National 
              Laboratory tells us it has established the world's first <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.lbl.gov/LBL-Programs/pbd/synthbio/aims.htm" target="_blank">Synthetic 
              Biology Department</a>, "to understand and design <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              systems&#8230;"</p>
<p>Some people might argue that it is pretty cavalier to work on "artificial 
              life" or "synthetic biology" before we have even 
              agreed on definitions for these "things." They might even 
              point out that "artificial life" containing <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s or new forms of biology could drastically alter the ecological 
              balance or even the evolutionary trajectory of life on Earth. Of 
              course the Lawrence Berkeley folks tell us we "need" synthetic 
              biology for all kinds of excellent <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s. We need it for the efficient 
              conversion of waste into <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and sunlight into <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>. We need 
              it to create new life forms to use as "soft" biomaterials 
              for tissue/organ <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>. We need it to spawn new cells that will 
              swim through the air or water to get to chemical and biological 
              threats and decontaminate them. We need it, and we will build it, 
              and it will be OK because we are the good guys (and gals). Our new 
              life forms will only do good things.</p>
<p>In fact, we are very dangerously confused. To understand how confused, 
              we must introduce the First Law of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a>ics: <i>The fusion of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, now called nanobiotechnology, 
              will result in the complete elimination of the barrier between living 
              and nonliving materials</i>. In other words, nanobiotechnology not 
              only has the goal, it has the mandate to break through the "carbon 
              barrier" of life. The result: We will produce not mere <a class="thought" href="entries/cyborg_entry.html">cyborg</a>s, 
              but true hybrid artificial life forms&#8212;or manifestations of 
              synthetic biology, take your pick. In a previous article on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.lbl.gov/LBL-Programs/pbd/synthbio/aims.htm" target="_blank">nanomedicine</a> 
              I described a few of the rudimentary "things" that will 
              emerge from nanobiotechnology: molecular machines that contain parts 
              from both the worlds of biology and human engineering. Single-walled 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> linked to DNA. Gold nanoshells linked to <a class="thought" href="entries/antibody_entry.html">antibody</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s.</p>
<p>But gold nanoshells linked to antibodies are just a simple prototype. 
              The fact is, we have no idea what artificial life and/or synthetic 
              biology is, much less what it could do, or how it will behave. A 
              recent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5749/769" target="_blank">article 
              in <i>Science</i></a> provides terrifying evidence of our hubris. 
              Toward the end of this article, the author explains, "Ethical 
              and environmental concerns must also be dealt with before synthetic 
              biology fully matures as a field. MIT, the Venter Institute, and 
              the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, 
              D.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>., have teamed up to examine issues such as how to keep any new 
              life forms created under control ... One solution: Alter synthetic 
              genetic codes such that they are incompatible with natural ones 
              because there is a mismatch in the gene's coding for amino acids."</p>
<p>In other words, we will be protected because these <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s will 
              have <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s never before seen on Earth! Perhaps, but that could 
              also be a description of the ultimate biohazard. If the Ebola <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> 
              is considered a Biosafety Level 4 threat, what level would categorize 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>ic organism made completely from synthetic genetic codes?</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to understand the astonishing leap we are about to make, 
              one needs to grasp that nanobiotechnology is more than just another 
              tool. It is also a monumental <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> in molecular evolution 
              over which we may ultimately have very little control. A nanobiotechnology 
              device that is smart enough to circulate through the body hunting 
              viruses or <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells is, by definition, smart enough to exchange 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> with that human body. This means, under the right conditions, 
              the "device" could evolve beyond its original function. 
              Cancer-hunting nanobots are often depicted as tiny robotic machines 
              &#8212;thus reassuringly impervious to fundamental changes brought 
              on by merging with their biological environment. But they will <i>not</i> 
              be tiny robots. That mechanical fantasy, promulgated by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/file:///tech/feature/2003/09/02/nanotechnology/" target="_blank">proponents 
              of "Drexlerian"</a> nanotechnology who appear devoid of 
              even the most rudimentary <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of chemistry, has been <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:0IZ3JeQ4E8wJ:cohesion.rice.edu/NaturalSciences/Smalley/emplibrary/SA285-76.pdf+chemistry+love+nanobots&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" target="_blank">decisively 
              refuted</a> by people who actually build the components for nanobiotechnology 
              systems. People like the late Nobel Prize-winning chemist Richard 
              E. Smalley and the great Harvard bioorganic chemist George Whitesides.</p>
<p>What will really go into our bodies, or out into the environment, 
              will be hybrid molecular devices composed of both synthetic and 
              biological components. These "devices" will have been 
              fabricated to specifically exchange chemical information with biological 
              or ecological systems. They will not be nanobots, they will be <i>nanobiobots</i>&#8212;and 
              those three letters make all the difference. </p>
<p>In fact, the ability to exchange molecular information with biological 
              systems will be an absolute requirement for these devices to carry 
              out the functions for which they will be created. To find cancer 
              cells, or dissolve arterial plaque, or modify damaged neurological 
              pathways, nanobiobots will be required to "speak" the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of biochemistry&#8212;our language, evolution's language. 
              Yet they will not be classifiable as the products of biological 
              evolution, or genetic or human engineering. They will be true hybrids. 
              We cannot, must not, assume that our current safety and testing 
              standards, whether chemical, biological or toxicological, will be 
              sufficient to predict the behavior of nanobiobots once they are 
              released into the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://glossary.eea.eu.int/EEAGlossary/P/precautionary_principle" target="_blank">precautionary 
              principle</a> developed for environmental policy states that "where 
              there are threats of serious or irreversible damage to the environment, 
              lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason 
              for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental 
              degradation." This is generally interpreted to mean that a 
              lower level of proof of harm can be used in policymaking whenever 
              the consequences of waiting for higher levels of proof may be very 
              costly and/or irreversible.</p>
<p>Given that we don't even have definitions for artificial life or 
              synthetic biology, how would we even begin to apply the precautionary 
              principle here? But we urgently need to.</p>
<p>Let's take a simple example. Plans are currently underway to create 
              medical nanobiobots that will use our own metabolic energy (for 
              example, glucose oxidation) as a source of power. That means these 
              devices could remain <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>al as long as we are alive&#8212;or 
              longer if they manage to get into human egg or sperm cells. Any 
              nanobiobot that develops the ability to propagate in this or any 
              other manner across even one human generation has fulfilled the 
              definition of a non-biological life form. A true alien. And it can 
              happen.</p>
<p>Suppose a glucose-powered nanobiobot has been created to hunt cancer 
              cells via a component <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.answers.com/topic/antibody" target="_blank">antibody</a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.everyscience.com/Chemistry/Glossary/M.php" target="_blank">moiety</a>. 
              In effect, this nanobiobot has a protein grappling hook designed 
              to dock it with a specific type of tumor <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. Standard dosing therapy 
              will require that billions of these nanobiobots be released into 
              their human "host." If the antibody arm on even one of 
              these nanobiobots is modified (either by some type of catalytic 
              recombination with circulating antibodies or by simple chemical 
              damage) so that it binds to a different type of cell, it could stay 
              in that body for life, like cryptic viruses such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/ebv.htm%22" target="_blank">Epstein-Barr</a>. 
              If this nanobiobot is modified so that it can attach to a human 
              sperm or egg cell, it could theoretically stay in the population 
              for generations.</p>
<p>If this type of nanobiotechnology-based cancer therapy becomes 
              common (and according to the NCI's <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> site, that is a 
              real possibility), we could have tens of thousands of people carrying 
              cryptic nanobiobots. Even though these nanobiobots were designed 
              for different functions, it is reasonable to assume that they will 
              have a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of components in common. For example, many of them 
              may have antibody components that, in turn, have regions of identical 
              protein <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>. These interchangeable parts could act just like 
              the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5309" target="_blank">repetitive 
              DNA</a> of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron" target="_blank">introns</a>

              What happens when one nanobiobot (say) on a sperm cell meets a second 
              one on an egg cell? The probability of this is, of course, extremely 
              low. But if the population of nanobiobots introduced into the body 
              is high (say, billions), then a one-in-a-million <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> becomes common. 
              In fact, microbial and viral systems like E. coli and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteriophage_entry.html">bacteriophage</a>s 
              enabled the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> revolution precisely because with 
              billions (or even trillions) of test organisms in hand, one-in-a-million 
              events become commonplace.</p>
<p>Suppose in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, a routine nanomedical procedure involved 
              the introduction of billions of nanobiobots designed to scour the 
              arteries dissolving plaque. Cleaning out the circulatory system 
              would be considered a "one shot" treatment so that these 
              therapeutic nanomedical devices (nanobiobots) would not have the 
              engine necessary to use human metabolic energy as a power source. 
              But what if, during another "routine" nanomedical procedure, 
              a second therapeutic nanomedical device (nanobiobot) designed to 
              vaccinate against cancer is introduced into the same person? This 
              latter nanobiobot would, by definition, be designed for longevity 
              so that metabolic energy would likely be the power source. Now, 
              what if these two meet up and combine, or exhange vital components? 
              This could happen through physico-chemical damage or perhaps via 
              some type of catalysis mediated by the host's own complex biochemistry. 
              Now we have a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>, hybrid nanobiobot capable of crawling through 
              our circulatory system for life. Or until it exchanges even more 
              information&#8212;either with another nanobiobot or with the body 
              itself. In the world of biology, this type of event would be called 
              a mutation.</p>
<p>Even more likely is the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion" target="_blank">"prion"</a> 
              scenario, in which one of the billions of nanobiobots in the body 
              is damaged or modified and, as a result, gains the ability to convert 
              other nanobiobots in a manner that alters longevity, tissue target, 
              etc. (This is what the abnormally structured proteins called prions 
              do. Prions are responsible for fatal, mysterious <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-tissue <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s 
              like "mad cow" and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Familial_Insomnia" target="_blank">fatal 
              familial insomnia</a>.) These myriad possibilities bring us to...</p>
<p>The Second Law of Nanobotics: <i>It is not possible to ensure that 
              devices created using the techniques of nanobiotechnology will only 
              transmit molecular information to the target system.</i></p>
<p>This law essentially says it is impossible to ensure that molecular 
              information only flows in one direction. Just as today's <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s 
              almost always have side effects, there is no natural law that guarantees 
              against the reverse movement of fundamental chemical information 
              from the biosystem to the nanobiobot. Any real nanobiotechnology 
              system&#8212;one that uses a combination of biological and synthetic 
              components&#8212;is theoretically vulnerable to a reversal in the 
              flow of molecular information. This, in turn, will create opportunities 
              for the unpredictable evolutionary advances of these devices via 
              a process similar to biological mutation.</p>
<p>Put plainly, if the nanobiobot can modify us there is no way to 
              ensure that we can't modify the nanobiobot.</p>
<p>Corollary to the Second Law of Nanobotics: Before nanobiobots are 
              used outside of a controlled research laboratory environment, we 
              must try to define and understand what it is we are making. And 
              rigorous <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s and adversary-analysis systems must be developed 
              to test these devices to ensure that they are not obviously vulnerable 
              to the reverse flow of molecular information. Of course, we will 
              never know this with certainty. But we haven't even started trying 
              to find out.</p>
<p>What this all means is that within a generation, biology will face 
              its ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> crisis. Researchers in the field of nanobiotechnology 
              are racing to achieve the complete molecular integration of living 
              and nonliving materials. We will hack into the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">CPU</a> of life in order 
              to insert new <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. The purpose is to extend the 
              capabilities of biology far beyond the limits imposed by evolution, 
              to integrate the incredible biochemistry of life with the equally 
              spectacular chemistry of nonliving systems like <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a>s and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/fiber_optics_entry.html">fiber optics</a>. The idea is to hard-wire biology directly into any 
              and every part of the nonliving world where it would be to our benefit. 
              Optoelectronic splices for the vision impaired, micromechanical 
              valves to restore heart function.</p>
<p>But the moment we close that nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> and allow electron current 
              to flow between living and nonliving <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, we open the nano-door 
              to new forms of living chemistry&#8212;shattering the "carbon 
              barrier." </p>
<p>This is, without doubt, the most momentous scientific development 
              since the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s. When we open the door and 
              allow new forms of chemistry to enter, we will change the very definition 
              of life. Yet no coherent strategy exists to identify the moment 
              when nanoengineered smart materials cross over into the realm of 
              living materials. Could we even recognize a noncarbon life form 
              at the moment of its creation? The answer seems intuitively obvious 
              until we remember that we too are made of materials. That we too 
              are machines.</p>
<p>Humans operate entirely on electric current. There are 10 trillion

              is a protein nanomachine designed by evolution to burn sugar, one 
              molecule at a time. The heat from this controlled burn yields high-energy 
              electrons that are the anima of the living state. Every move you 
              make can be traced back to a specific flicker of this electron fire.

              the plants. The first step is the light-driven fusion of water and 
              carbon dioxide into sugar via the photosynthetic organisms&#8212;green 
              plants and some microbes. This sugar is the fuel that drives the 
              chemical engine of animal life. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a> use bio-catalytic 
              converters to strip electrons from sugar and feed them into your

<p><a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> conduction thus provides the true <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> between 
              living and nonliving materials. Today's technology does not allow 
              fabrication of components that plug directly into this interface, 
              but we are getting close. In the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, nanotechnology 
              will create the tools to hard-wire into the CPU of life, while biotechnology 
              will provide a <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/schema_entry.html">schema</a>tic of our living <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s. 
              It is the engineering destiny of nanobiotechnology to create the 
              first electro-molecular interface between the living and nonliving 
              worlds. Or, more correctly, the first interface that does not discriminate 
              between the living and nonliving states of matter. Fabrication of 
              the world's first true Biomolecule-to-Material interface will be 
              infinitely more than a landmark in the evolution of human technology. 
              Like the separate days of Genesis, the first nanofabricated BTM 
              interface will be its own monumental act of creation and a crucial 
              step on the path to bona fide living materials, aka artificial life.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, the conduction of signals between living 
              and nonliving materials will be divided into the pre-<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> and 
              nanotech eras. We are still pre-nanotech, which means that a direct 
              BTM interface has yet to be fabricated, although <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> 
              has created synthetic devices that communicate indirectly with living 
              materials. Take an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker" target="_blank">artificial 
              pacemaker</a>. This device transmits an electrical voltage to the 
              biological pacemaker cells of the heart. In a healthy human, these 
              pacemaker cells generate their own <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> potential, an electrical 
              waveform of about 100 millivolts. This may not sound like much energy 
              until we remember that this electrical potential is sustained across 
              an insulating membrane only five nanometers thick. That is 5 billionths 
              of a meter. So the energy of an action potential is almost 20,000,000 
              volts per meter. Compare this to the 12,000 volts per meter at a 
              standard wall plug. Healthy pacemaker cells spark the electrical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> that drives heart muscle contraction. When these cells malfunction, 
              an artificial pacemaker may be implanted to take over. Waves of 
              electrical voltage generated at the metal lead of the artificial 
              device cross over to living tissue and initiate normal muscle contraction.</p>
<p>While the pacemaker is a magnificent feat of bioengineering, it 
              does not operate via a true BTM interface. The metal lead of the 
              artificial pacemaker, a small wire, is physically embedded in cardiac 
              tissue and the wave of voltage spreads from the charged tip into 
              the surrounding region. Only pacemaker cells will respond to the 
              artificial voltage wave by initiating a further action potential. 
              So the living system must identify the artificial signal and act 
              upon it. The voltage produced by an implanted pacemaker, like a 
              radio signal, will pass through space unnoticed unless there is 
              an antenna to pick it up. In this case the receiving antennae are 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> protein molecules embedded in the membrane of the living 
              cardiac pacemaker cell. Other heart cells feel the electrical signal, 
              but do not respond to it. They may be considered as nonspecific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> in the system. We must flood the local tissue with electricity 
              in order to obtain the desired response.</p>
<p>This strategy is extremely effective, but it does not constitute 
              a direct interface between living and nonliving materials. In the 
              end, the pacemaker does not "know" that the target cells 
              are out there. It will send its signal regardless of whether it 
              is received or not. Likewise, the cardiac pacemaker cells do not 
              "know" that the charged metal lead is out there; they 
              simply respond to an electrical shock.</p>
<p>By contrast, a nanofabricated pacemaker with a true BTM interface 
              will feed electrons from an implanted nanoscale device directly 
              into electron-conducting <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule" target="_blank">biomolecules</a> 
              that are naturally embedded in the membrane of the pacemaker cells. 
              There will be no noise across this type of interface. Electrons 
              will only flow if the living and nonliving materials are hard-wired 
              together. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, the system can be said to have functional 
              self-awareness: Each side of the BTM interface has an operational 
              knowledge of the other.</p>
<p>Molecular imprinting offers one nanotechnology strategy to build 
              a BTM switch in the near future. A molecular imprint works exactly 
              the way one would think. An isolated biomolecule is surrounded by 
              some type of self-reactive liquified matrix, often an unpolymerized 
              plastic like acrylamide. A cross-linking reagent is added, and a 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer" target="_blank">polymer</a> 
              forms around the biomolecule. When the biomolecule is removed, its 
              ghostly outline is etched into a surface of solid plastic. The imprint 
              fits the biological surface with atomic precision so this nanoengineered 
              component is now a socket into which any identical biomolecule can 
              be plugged. In the case of a pacemaker, the voltage-sensitive protein 
              switches from cardiac cells would be imprinted into an electronic 
              material. The imprinted material would be nanomachined and joined 
              to an equally small power generator. The entire nanodevice, except 
              for the imprinted socket, is then coated with a <a class="thought" href="entries/biomimetic_entry.html">biomimetic</a> ultrathin 
              film. This coating makes the surface compatible with heart tissue. 
              This nanopacemaker will occupy less than 1 cubic micrometer, smaller 
              than a single bacterium. To complete the BTM interface, a living 
              cardiac pacemaker cell is excised from the patient and plugged into 
              the socket created by the original molecular imprint process. This 
              can be accomplished with a micromanipulator similar to those currently 
              used to move living nuclei in and out of cells. The "hard-wired" 
              nanopacemaker is implanted into the heart where it is cemented into 
              place by the body's normal healing process.</p>
<p>The example above was selected because it is relatively simple, 
              using technology that is already in the pipeline. Far more sophisticated 
              strategies are on the horizon. One involves literally drawing the 
              imprinted surface around the biomolecule by polymerizing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer" target="_blank">monomers</a> 
              with a computer-targeted <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a>. When bioengineers begin to fabricate 
              these BTM interfaces we will have entered the nanobiotech era.</p>
<p>If we continue to insist that life on Earth can only result from 
              biological evolution, then the first BTM interfaces built by nanobiotechnology 
              will be speciously trivialized as just a great invention of Homo 
              sapiens. We will congratulate ourselves and conclude that the supremely 
              gifted toolmaker has built the first <a class="thought" href="entries/portal_entry.html">portal</a> between the worlds of 
              living and nonliving materials. This simplistic view of nanobiotechnology 
              is very much like humanity's current strategy in the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for 
              extraterrestrial life. In a chemically diverse <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> we insist 
              on a perversely self-congratulatory strategy. Water and organic 
              molecules, such as methane, are the identified spoor on this trail. 
              We look for these signs because the biology-centric assumption is 
              that aliens will be just like us, only very, very different&#8212;little 
              green people with acid for blood, <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> jellyfish with a taste 
              for cheeseburgers, or <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s that have evolved with a sense of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>. Even search strategies that use "universal mathematical 
              constants" ignore the possibility, proposed by some postmodern 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics" target="_blank">philosophers 
              of science</a>, that formal modern mathematics is a function of 
              cognitive structure unique to humans, or less specifically to a 
              narrow range of beings similar to humans, for example, hominids. 
              The point is that technology analysts who can only see life as some 
              variation on biology will see the BTM interface as a way for "us" 
              to plug into "it." Within this <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> there are no consequences 
              for the definition of life, only new enhancements for the one true 
              life form: biology. We hold up the mirror of humanity and see our 
              own image reflected in the universe.</p>
<p>Most dictionaries define biology as "the science of living 
              things." But the (correctly) limitless <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of that definition 
              is truncated when plants and animals are immediately used as the 
              prime examples. <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>, an agency that should know better, has saturated 
              the media for decades with hypnotic invocations of water and organics 
              as the true signs of extraterrestrial life. Meanwhile, Hollywood 
              and pop culture endlessly <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/06/21/robots/print.html" target="_blank">anthropomorphize 
              aliens</a>. Robots get the blues. <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> sentience springs directly 
              from human mythology. Stories of demonic computers and undead cyber-blood 
              lust are endlessly refilmed with really cool graphics, a variety 
              of soundtracks, and excellent eyewear. Skynet, the "self-aware" 
              computer system of the "Terminator" series, hates us and 
              wants us dead. The equally demonic cyber-beings of "The Matrix" 
              want to enslave us and eat our energy (making this computer both 
              physically dangerous and dangerously ignorant of the physical laws 
              of the universe). It is distinctly ironic that when we consider 
              aliens, life on Earth infuses our scientific models, our dreams, 
              and our <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a>. We could call this "the biology paradox." 
              The biology paradox makes xenobiology speciously comprehensible, 
              but by clinging to it we dismiss almost all of the chemistry in 
              the universe.</p>
<p>It is time for serious students of sentience to accept that common 
              usage has rendered the term "biology" completely useless 
              in the nanotech age. Thinking outside the biology box leads to the 
              alternative, much more radical <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of living materials&#8212;materials 
              with anima. </p>
<p>To describe this new state of life, I suggest a contraction of 
              the term "anima-materials"&#8212;"animats." This 
              term has previously been used to describe adaptive or cognitive 
              systems capable of robust action in a dynamic environment. The goal 
              of these systems involves the creation of higher levels of cognition 
              from many smaller processes. Many scientists who work in this field 
              appear ready to dismiss chemical sentience as smaller and simpler 
              than anything they would consider smart. But we must not assume 
              that minds are built from mindless stuff. Chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              can manifest as the ability to catalyze a single chemical reaction. 
              It is a dangerous, and possibly terminal, error for the children 
              of carbon to dismiss the power of pure electron fire. Much of our 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/12/09/bioterror_funding/" target="_blank">fear 
              of bioterror</a> is based on the power (chemical intelligence) of 
              a single molecule that allows it to block a single metabolic reaction 
              inside the human body.</p>
<p>Better to heed Bertrand Russell's prescient warning that "Every 
              living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much 
              as possible of its environment into itself." Russell goes on 
              to use the term "chemical imperialism" as the driving 
              force for biological life. The obvious corollary to this warning 
              is that chemical imperialism spawned human intelligence, not the 
              other way around. Therefore, the definition of an animat as a living 
              material should have primacy over any definition involving more 
              complex cognitive functions. If we accept this <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>, the creation 
              of the first BTM interface by nanobiotechnology will require a new 
              operational definition for the living state.</p>
<p>To expand the chemical franchise of the living state we must first 
              deconstruct biology. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project" target="_blank">The 
              Human Genome Project</a> sold us the concept that DNA is the chemical 
              basis of life. But, in fact, that is not true. DNA is the result 
              of life, not its cause. Our genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> is the crowning achievement 
              of biochemistry, not its progenitor.</p>
<p>It is crucial to keep this distinction in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> when considering 
              the concept of animats. Life is not defined by DNA but by a continuous 
              chemical struggle against <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" target="_blank">second 
              law of thermodynamics</a> tells us that all natural systems move 
              spontaneously toward maximum entropy. By literally assembling itself 
              from thin air, biological life appears to be the lone exception 
              to this law. The gaseous molecules snared by plants during photosynthesis 
              were once free to roam the entire atmosphere of Earth. Plants&#8212;Earth's 
              primary producers &#8212;fix gas molecules from the air and minerals 
              from the water into sugars and proteins. Humans eat the plants, 
              or we eat the animals that eat the plants. Now those molecules that 
              were free to roam the skies and waters must be where you are, go 
              where you go, and do what you do. Clearly, the atoms in your body 
              have experienced a radical <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" target="_blank">entropy</a>. 
              But thermodynamics takes the full measure of the physical world. 
              What little biology can build is barely visible against the chaotic 
              horizon generated as the sun exfoliates into space. Like a tiny 
              windmill in the solar hurricane, the wheel of life is turned by 
              a unique <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of chemical reactions that capture and channel the 
              least part of that storm of dissipating energy into further cycles 
              of replication. Biological life is a tiny stowaway on the entropy-powered 
              craft of our <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>.</p>
<p>Life, then, is not based on DNA but on a chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming language 
              spoken by a discrete set of biomolecules. This language directs 
              the set of operations necessary to assemble the next generation 
              of biomolecules. DNA or <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>, the genetic material, stores the directory 
              of available biochemical operations but does not execute them. The 
              program steps for replication are executed by a set of protein catalysts 
              collectively known as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" target="_blank">enzymes</a>. 
              It is probable that the first biological life forms were RNA molecules 
              capable of both catalytic replication and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> storage&#8212;so-called 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribozyme" target="_blank">ribozymes</a>. 
              Through evolutionary time, RNA generated two biochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/subroutine_entry.html">subroutine</a>s, 
              proteins and DNA, to carry out some of the operations of replication 
              and data storage with greater efficiency. Yet a cursory look at 
              the molecular biology of the cell proves that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA" target="_blank">RNA</a> 
              retains its central role. If life is viewed as a discrete set of 
              chemical operations, then nanofabricated components that directly 
              interface biological and materials chemistry must create the possibility 
              of new life forms. These nanofabricated components are, in fact, 
              the next generation of self-replicating systems: not enzymes but 
              animats.</p>
<p>One could argue that it is too early to be talking about animats. 
              It is easy, and reassuring, to dismiss even the most advanced nanobiotechnology 
              systems of the near future as mere devices. But if biological evolution 
              is any guide, that viewpoint is both specious and potentially catastrophic. 
              During the 3-billion-year operation of the algorithm called evolution, 
              revolutionary new adaptations often began as trivial events. A small 
              genetic mutation resulting in a slightly altered protein that provides 
              an incremental, almost trivial, enhancement to catalytic function.</p>
<p>Thermal tolerance is a classic example. A mutation to the DNA sequence 
              translates into a modified physical structure for an essential protein. 
              This new structure has enhanced thermal stability, which means it 
              retains enzymatic function at a higher temperature than the original. 
              As a result, the mutant is capable of 100 percent catalytic efficiency 
              in climates a few degrees hotter than normal. This change in protein 
              structure will only involve the rearrangement of a few atoms, making 
              molecular evolution the original nanoengineer.</p>
<p>Over time, the heat-tolerant progeny of the original mutant may 
              be able to migrate into a warmer climate: say, move down the Sierra 
              Nevada into <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> Valley. But it takes thousands of reproductive 
              generations or more for this migration to actually occur. The original 
              mutation will not become essential for a hundred thousand, or even 
              millions of years. Evolution covers enormous distances one <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angstrom" target="_blank">angstrom</a> 
              at a time, which means it is almost impossible to catch an adaptation 
              at the exact moment, or even in the exact generation, that it becomes 
              essential for survival. Likewise, it is highly probable that the 
              BTM interface will evolve from smart material to living material. 
              This means that, in order to find the moment when the first animat 
              appeared on Earth, we will have to backtrack from the future. Or 
              be watching the present very, very carefully.</p>
<p>Based on this evolutionary model, it is highly unlikely that animats 
              will spring fully grown upon the Earth. It is much more likely that 
              animats will initially evolve as part of a larger biological system. 
              In order to identify the first true manifestation of a living nonbiological 
              material, we must develop a definitive test to distinguish an organism 
              that is at least part animat from one that carries a smart material 
              designed simply to assist or enhance life function.</p>
<p>This brings us to the Third Law of Nanobotics: <i>The carbon barrier 
              will be eliminated when humans create the first synthetic molecular 
              device capable of changing the state of a living system via direct, 
              intentional transfer of specific chemical information from one to 
              the other.</i></p>
<p>This law formalizes the concept of animats and leads directly to 
              the "Animat Test," which is designed to identify the moment 
              in time when life on Earth evolves to include both biological and 
              nonbiological materials&#8212;the date when we break the carbon barrier. 
            </p>
<p>Let us define a life form as an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> that reduces entropy by 
              self-executing the minimum set of physical and chemical operations 
              necessary to sustain the ability to execute functionally equivalent 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropic" target="_blank">negentropic</a> 
              operations indefinitely across time. Given that, a life form will 
              be considered an animat (living material) if all the information 
              necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations 
              cannot be stored in DNA or RNA. The corollary: If all the information 
              necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations 
              can be stored in DNA or RNA, the life form is biological.</p>
<p>In the beginning, nanobiotechnology will create minute supplemental 
              lifesaving medical devices for humans. The purpose of these devices 
              will rapidly expand to include the performance-enhancing&#8212;an 
              inexorable development I have <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://salon.com/tech/feature/2003/09/30/bioengineering/index1.html" target="_blank">discussed 
              previously</a>. Some of these things will remain devices. But some 
              will have the potential to evolve and should be termed proto-animats. 
              The animat test is designed to be a practical engineering tool to 
              identify the point in time when the proto-animat crosses over and 
              becomes a true living material, an animat. The conditions of the 
              test are independent of both the physical structure of the life 
              form and the physical modality by which the life form perpetuates 
              a negentropic existence across time. That modality could include 
              replication, and/or duplication, and/or continuous self-restoration. 
              The test cannot be applied to entropic life forms since human understanding 
              of physical laws does not currently allow discrimination between 
              life forms and other natural phenomena without cycles of entropy 
              reduction.</p>
<p>Much as we track incoming comets on a possible collision course 
              with Earth, extraordinary vigilance is required as we transition 
              into the age of nanobiotechnology. If the evolutionary model prevails, 
              we are seeking to identify proto-animats: smart materials potentially 
              capable of evolving into animats, living materials. This, in turn, 
              will require a radical expansion of our thinking with respect to 
              the potential sources of artificial life. Up till now (and thanks 
              to people like Ray, Bill and Eric), most models have focused on 
              computers and machine intelligence. Smart materials can certainly 
              contain computers. But it is unlikely that animats will spring to 
              life via some Hollywood scenario whereby a <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a> crashes 
              into A.I. self-awareness and begins photovoltaic-powered reproductive 
              assembly of little A.I.s (subsequent end-of-the-human-world-as-we-know-it 
              scenarios optional, heavy metal sound track preferred). If the evolutionary 
              algorithm is any guide, animats will break the carbon barrier the 
              way the Bell X-1 broke the sound barrier, carried aloft on the wings 
              of a mother ship. The mother ship will be named Homo sapiens. The 
              initial manifestation of an animat life form will be evolutionary 
              in form, but revolutionary in function. There is also the possibility 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion from the ternary fusion of biological life, machine 
              intelligence, and smart materials (proto-animats). But it is crucial 
              to recognize that living materials need only think with their chemistry. 
              No Boolean or <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> logic is required to qualify as life. The 
              absolute progress of chemical imperialism can only be measured in 
              entropy reduction.</p>
<p>Unless we know what we are looking for, the first proto-animats 
              will be invisible in the storm of nanobioengineering systems expected 
              to come online over the next generation of human life. Most of these 
              nanodevices will not have the potential to evolve beyond cyborg 
              mode, i.e., technical <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a>s to biological life forms. There 
              are many future scenarios in which humans will need their machines 
              to continue to live, but until an animat is carried through time 
              as part of a life form's self-executing set of essential operations, 
              the carbon barrier will remain intact. But when the portal between 
              two worlds is <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>-size, how will we know when it finally opens?</p>
<p>In a world where we are already doing research on artificial life, 
              synthetic biology and nanobiotechnology, this question cannot possibly 
              be considered academic. Materials will continue to get smarter until 
              they finally break the carbon barrier. In the near future, some 
              nanoscale cyborg technology will undoubtedly be designed to propagate 
              along with the host using molecular self-assembly, the same strategy 
              used by biological systems.</p>
<p>But self-assembly is not unique to living systems and, therefore, 
              cannot be used as the litmus test for new forms of life. Water molecules 
              can self-assemble into the simple crystalline <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of an ice 
              cube or the infinite complexity of a snowflake. Quartz and other 
              inorganic minerals can spontaneously crystallize and grow with a 
              concomitant reduction in entropy, yet <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://www.geodegallery.com/" target="_blank">geodes 
              are definitely not alive</a>.</p>
<p>However, molecular self-assembly is an excellent strategy for building 
              nanomachines and many researchers are studying ways to harness this 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>. Such nanomachines could even be designed to use self-assembly 
              to replicate. The original <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo" target="_blank">"Grey 
              Goo"</a> scare (the very mention of which is anathema to most 
              nanoscientists) involved a scenario whereby endlessly self-replicating 
              nanomachines literally covered the earth. This scenario is generally 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>d to speculation contained in Eric Drexler&#8217;s 1986 
              book "Engines of Creation."</p>
<p>While the science behind the original <a class="thought" href="entries/grey_goo_entry.html">Grey Goo</a> scare was and remains 
              completely unrealistic, we are getting better and better at using 
              molecular self-assembly to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080609114320/http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/research_selfassembly.html" target="_blank">build, 
              maintain and propagate nanomachines</a>. For example, it is certainly 
              realistic to posit nanomachines that use ingested trace metals and 
              semiconductor nanoparticles (for example, silica) to replicate inside 
              the host's cells, including germ cells. This type of device could 
              enhance human performance and even move from parent to child, yet 
              would not be considered to be a new life form (either alone or in 
              combination with its human host) unless it could pass the animat 
              test. More to the point, the animat test gives us a way to determine 
              when a smart material crosses over and becomes a life form.</p>
<p>It is ironic that, because of nanobiotechnology, we have never 
              been closer to a Grey Goo scenario&#8212;although the actual color 
              will more likely be green or red. Because biomolecules learned self-assembly 
              through billions of years of evolution, nanobiotechnology has a 
              tremendous advantage when it comes to applying this particular strategy 
              to create artificial life.</p>
<p>In fact, we have put into <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> research that will create every 
              component necessary to build an animat. One formula is as simple 
              as A + B + C.</p>
<p>A = Nanobiotechnology devices that can survive and function inside 
              human beings. Many therapeutic devices in development for drug delivery, 
              cancer therapy, etc., are designed to survive in the physicochemical 
              environment of the body.</p>
<p>B = Nanobiotechnology devices that can derive energy from biological 
              metabolism. Many nanomedical devices will be powered by the fuel 
              available inside the human body. A common idea is to take our own 
              glucose-oxidizing enzymes and use them as a fuel cell for the nanobiobot.</p>
<p>C = Nanobiotechnology devices capable of copying themselves by 
              molecular self-assembly.</p>
<p>Which creates a completely realistic animat formula. A + B + C 
              = a self-replicating nanobiobot capable of living inside the human 
              body powered by our own metabolic energy.</p>
<p>Of course, scientists are not intentionally putting A together 
              with B and C. No one is trying to create the first true animat&#8212;they're 
              just working on rudimentary forms of artificial life or synthetic 
              biology. But if, as part of this benign research initiative, they 
              happen to create nanobiobots some of which have traits A or B or 
              C&#8212;our definition of life will have changed forever.</p>
<p>Does this mean we will immediately cease to be human? Probably 
              not. The most probable scenario is that an array of proto-animats 
              will be carried as an evolutionary adaptation that enhances biological 
              function for generations before any of them become an essential 
              part of our <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a>. After that...</p>
<p>If the animat test described here is not sufficient, let it stand 
              as a challenge for the development of a completely rigorous test 
              for the unequivocal identification of nonbiological life forms. 
              The larger point is that humanity must initiate a search-and-test 
              protocol now in order to prepare for the arrival of the literal 
              alien from within.</p>
<p>Nanofabricated animats may be infinitessimally tiny, but their 
              electrons will be exactly the same size as ours&#8212;and their effect 
              on human <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> will be as immeasurable as the universe. Like an 
              inverted <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> program, humanity must now look inward, constantly 
              scanning technology space for animats, or their progenitors. The 
              first alien life may not come from the stars, but from ourselves.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Lately I find myself staggering from mere analysis into what I can best call "belief". Belief in this context would be from merely having an intuition to starting to have an primitive inkling of the permutations and implications that lie beyond intuition. It isn't religion, it's more a certainty that all there is will be more or less gone within a few decades, for good or for bad. 
<br>
<br>
If humanity succeeds in transferring its limited mind into the future substrates, and not just some white anglosaxon corporate elite, we can count ourselves bloody lucky. But it can all go very very "skynet".
<br>
<br>
I walk the streets today a believer, someone touched with a measure of certainty. That is no slight thing. People who talk to me look at me suspiciously but nod in agreement, when I tell them my arguments. They realize something is happening but they dont believe yet. They only glimpse the basics, not the vast implications.
<br>
<br>
As soon as more people will start to believe a whole lot of them will become affraid... very affraid. 
<br>
<br>
All of this will be gone. Within decades. For better or for worse. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>sounds like a "Blood Music" type prediction- I think the idea of nanobiotek hybrids causing more radical changes to humanity than mechanical or bio nanotech on their own is probably true- but I think it will go EVEN further when we start to incorporate various forms of artificial matter such as q-dot electron shells and proto-femtotechnology using artificicial neutronium femto-constructs- perhaps even the use of micro black-holes/wormholes and new forms of exotic 'programmed' matter from the harnessed atomic output states of special forms of nanoscale quantum computation-
<br>
<br>
I predict that very suddenly and uncontrollably all matter/energy/space/time of our local reality will become as free/ copyable/ programmable as digitial information is today- and EVERYTHING will be as just as easily accesible on this new global network- all linear histories and lines of evolution will become nonlinear/ parallel- the basic causality of our existence will no longer hold and space/time/memory/ human identity will all become moot</p></td>

You feel that identity, or as we'll come to define it, will necessarily, or by simple convenience, be refined in accessability and awareness of others. Enriched. (Nothing's lost).
<br>
<br>
If this is your meaning generally, i agree. I also think because of this a desire to inhabit several or a million different bodies won't hold much interest.
<br>
<br>
We're already so in-tune with each other from their perspectives, why bother be-boppin' about in a million us's from the same ol' identy perspective?
<br>
<br>
Now. If your saying this is the point.. we're merging so to speak, an all personality mixer 24/7 but still (inclusive of our original identity in its entirety).. then yea, i can see it.
<br>
<br>
If the later is your meaning specifically, then i agree completely, "linear histories" as we presently perceive time and our inclusive particpation are moot.. that's incredible to think about.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>When I first read stuff by Ray Kurzweil, what I first thought, and this persists to this day, is a sort of (is it Hindu or Buddha that believes in reincarnation?) religious reincarnation. Or even, reliving your past, or live as anyone or anything that you want. For me, I think the best sort of future we could make would not be really a future, but a way to just freeze time. I think the ultimate goal for me would not be to continue living in a radical new ever-changing world, but to essentially live in virtual environments. Honestly I've gotta side with Cypher from The Matrix that "ignorance is bliss" .. although we won't be exactly ignorant.
<br>
<br>
Plus it wouldn't be favorable to be controlled by machines obviously, because they would keep us in this constrained world, but I do think I would want to live in this time period for decades, maybe hundreds of years. I believe it would be wonderful to be able to pick and choose exactly the kinds of things you do, living a full life as another person, then, instead of dying, you just decided to start life all over, but as a different person, but still in today's "normal" world. 
<br>
<br>
I think the way we live now is the most enjoyable one. We have just enough technology to be comfortable most of the time, but are still ourselves enough to have the many facets of human drama. I wouldn't want to live perfectly, always having complete control of what happens to me, I would want that element of surprise, but it would be nice to know that it will someday be done if things are too painful, and I can keep on going. 
<br>
<br>
I think it would be marvelous to experience certain kinds of pain that we would be able to "prevent" and avoid with these new technologies. It would be kinda cool to feel what it's like to be shot, or in a car accident, or choked, or have cancer, or a heart attack or raped. All of these tragedies that we want to prevent, I would like to be able to live them, but just for a short while, and move onto another life, but always maintaining my memory, true identity and self awareness through all of it. 
<br>
<br>
In fact, the way I see us being "Enhanced" as Joel Garreau says, won't be doing radical things in the real world like having exponential memory or being able to heal ourselves, we would rather have a way to put a slight amount of control in our chaotic world, and do things as we do them now. This is the future I hope to see.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Since the thesis of the article is that we need to implement the precautionary principle with respect to "nanobiotechnology,"  I have a few questions:
<br>
<br>
Who will be the gatekeepers for accessing the technology?  Do you mean a group of attorneys or a group of elected representatives?  Do you mean yourself?  This has been a problem for me since Bill Joy's "The Future Doesn't Need Us."
<br>
<br>
What do you mean by certainty?  It is possible to determine certainty in an engineering sense provided you have enough systems in service (a large enough sample).  The precautionary principle means that you won't get the sample size or the cycles of learning necessary to make it either cost effective or safe.  As an example, let's say the technology will be at least as restricted as space technology is today.  The problem here is that nobody knows how safe space flight really is, in part, because there are so few flights.  Few flights means that don't uncover flaws to even make valid estimates as to the shape of the distribution of failures.  I'm guessing that the distribution is *not* Gaussian, by the way, therefore the estimates for safety today are probably too high.  Perhaps restricting citizen access to space is a feature since only 6-8 astronauts are killed during any given large-scale failure but we also miss out on unrealized benefits of permanent human habitation off-planet.
<br>
<br>
Someone would have to set a tolerance on the uncertainty of safety.  Why would you expect anyone to agree on these limits?  One person's "safe enough" will not necessarily be another's "Pure Food Act."
<br>
<br>
In short, the precautionary principle has been tried in weak forms (space) and strong forms (restriction of guns during the Tokugawa period in Japan -- yes, I know there was cheating) and has been a failure from the point of view of human advancement.  Is the point, then, not to have human advancement because you feel uncomfortable?
<br>
<br>
A quibble from the article:
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> The precautionary principle developed for environmental policy states that "where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage to the environment, lack of full scientific certainty should not (sic?) be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." </p></center>
<br>
Isn't the precautionary principle the "lack of scientific certainty *should* be used as a reason for postponing any technological advance which might threaten enviornmental degradation?"
<br>
<br>
I don't want to be part of the logic police but I think the article's quote actually means the opposite of what the precautionary principle says.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Interesting that, in order to promote this "catastrophic evolution is coming" theory, the author finds it necessary to discount "Drexlerian" nanotechnology (Smalley's charmingly snide SciAm "Love, Chemistry and Nanobots" article pointed to in an attempt to make that point, was very lame - even a non-chemist like me could see a dozen holes in his arguments. ).  
<br>
<br>
"Drexlerians" have already recognized the core danger the author focuses on - self-replication - and shifted focus to a more practical and far less dangerous approach approach that minimizes that danger.
<br>
<br>
However, the author is correct - synthetic biology *is* far more dangerous than it's proponents are willing to admit, precisely because - in order to be an effective tool - it must rely on some form of self-replication - either an artificially implemented form, or a parasitic form that modifies natural life forms to reproduce the synth-life.
<br>
<br>
The syn-bio researchers really need to be hit with a "gray goo" meme, to get them thinking beyond simplistic ideas like containing their creations by reliance on special "vitamins" not normally found in living creatures.
<br>
<br>
Still, I don't think the author made a good case for how evolution of his "animats" will proceed so fas as to rapidly cause the end of humanity.  Humans may well bootstrap syn-bio past the first billion years of evolution that life had to go through, but that doesn't imply that the mutation and independent evolution of animats will continue at that same rate.  Syn-bio may cause disasters - but they'll probably happen slow enough that we have time to react and do something about them.</p></td>
