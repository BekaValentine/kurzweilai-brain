<p>It has been said that when people make forecasts, they overestimate what can be done in the short run and underestimate what can be achieved in the long run. I have worked in the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> for twenty years and confess to being chronically optimistic about its <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. The gains have been substantial, even impressive. But we have hardly begun, and we must not lose sight of the point to which we are heading, however distant it may seem.</p>
<p>We are beginning the transition from <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> processing to <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> processing. The key tool of our specialty is the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the most complex and yet the most general <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> ever invented. Though the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is a universal symbol-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, we have exploited to date only its mundane capabilities to file and retrieve <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> (file service) and to do high-speed arithmetic. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> have been studying techniques for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> representation of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and the methods by which that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> can be used to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> toward the solution of problems, the formation of hypotheses, and the discovery of new concepts and new <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. These <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have been inventing the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>s of our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>Like all creators, scientists and technologists must <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, must put forth a vision, or else they relegate their work to almost pointless incrementalism. My <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> is about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development over the next several decades and the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that can be produced thereby to assist the modern <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> worker.</p><h1>The Beginnings of the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">Dream</a></h1><p>Fifty years ago, before the modern era of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> began, Turing's theorems and abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s gave hint of the fundamental idea that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could be used to model the symbol-manipulating processes that make up the most <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> of all behaviors: <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. More than thirty years ago the work began in earnest (1991 will mark the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Dartmouth Summer Conference on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>). The founding principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is really an article of faith that the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. This first principle is called the physical-symbol-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> hypothesis.</p>
<p>The early dreaming included dreams about intelligent behavior at very high levels of competence. Turing speculated on wide-ranging conversations between people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and on <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Later Newell and Simon wrote about champion-level <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and began their work toward that end. Samuel (checker playing), Gelernter (<a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>-theorem proving), and others shared the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>.</p>
<p>At Stanford, Lederberg and I chose <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> as our task and began work with Buchanan and Djerassi on building a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that would elucidate chemical structure at a high level of competence: the <a class="thought" href="entries/dendral_entry.html">DENDRAL</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. What emerged from the many experiments with <a class="thought" href="entries/dendral_entry.html">DENDRAL</a> was an empirical hypothesis that the source of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>'s power to figure out chemical structures from spectral <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> was its <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> and spectral <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>. For <a class="thought" href="entries/dendral_entry.html">DENDRAL</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> was power. Obvious? In retrospect, perhaps. But the prevailing view in Al at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> ascribed power to the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing processes-in modern terms, to the inference <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>, not the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>. Thus, in the late 1960s the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-is-power hypothesis stood as a counter-hypothesis awaiting further tests and the accumulation of evidence.</p>
<p>Much evidence came in the 1970s. Medical problem solving provided the springboard. The <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> of Shortliffe and others at Stanford was the prototype of the expert-level advisory (or consultation) <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The core of <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> was its <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> of rules for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing process was simple (<a class="thought" href="entries/backward_chaining_entry.html">backward chaining</a>), even ad hoc in parts. But <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> was built as an integrated package of intellectual abilities. It could interact with a professional in the professional jargon of the specialty. It could explain its line of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. And it had a subsystem that could aid in the acquisition of new <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> by guiding an expert to find defects in the stored <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Overall, <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a> provided strong confirmation to the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-is-power hypothesis.</p>
<p>At nearly the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> other efforts in medical problem solving were providing similar results. At the University of Pittsburgh the focus of the Internist project was the construction of an enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> textbook of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of internal <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. With its current <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> of 572 diseases, nearly 4,500 manifestations, and hundreds of thousands of links between them, Internist has provided the strongest confirmation yet of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-is-power hypothesis.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s an explosion of <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s was taking place in fields other than <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, manufacturing, geology, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, financial services, diagnostic servicing of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> signal processing, and many other areas. There is little that ties these areas together other than this: in each, high-quality problem solving is guided by experiential, qualitative, <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The explosion of applications created a new type of professional, the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er (now in extremely short supply) and a new industry, the <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s industry (now rapidly expanding). One generalization from the frenzy of activity is simply massive additional confirmation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-is-power hypothesis. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing procedures associated with all of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are weak. Their power lies in their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s.</p>
<p>Other areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> made shifts to the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> viewpoint. It is now commonplace to say, A <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> must have extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of its domain of discourse. A vision <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for image understanding must have <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the world it is intended to see. And even, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s must have a substantial body of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from which to expand (that is, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> takes place at the fringes and interstices of what is already known. Thus, the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that performs at a high level of competence over a wide variety of tasks that people perform well seems to rest upon <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in the task areas.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-is-power hypothesis has received so much confirmation that we can now assert it as the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a>:</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> exhibits intelligent understanding and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> at a high level of competence primarily because of the specific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that it contains about its domain of endeavor.</p>
<p>A corollary to the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a> is that <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing processes of an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, being general and therefore weak, are not the source of power that leads to high levels of competence in behavior. The <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a> simply says that if a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is to perform well, it must know a great deal about the world in which it operates. In the absence of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing won't help.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a> is the emblem of the first era of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>; it is the first part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>. It should inform and influence every decision about what it is feasible to do in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and with <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p><h1>The Middle of the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">Dream</a></h1><p>Today our intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s perform well on specialized tasks within narrowly defined domains. An industry has been formed to put this technological understanding to work, and widespread transfer of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been achieved. Although the first era of the intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is ending, many problems remain to be solved.</p>
<p>One of these is naturalness. The <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligent_agent_entry.html">intelligent agent</a> should interact with its <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> user in a fluid and flexible manner that appears natural to the person. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of the first era share with the majority of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s an intolerable rigidity of stylistic <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, vocabulary, and concepts. For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s rarely accept synonyms, and they cannot interpret and use metaphors. They always interact in a rigid grammatical straitjacket. The need for metaphor to induce in the user a feeling of naturalness seems critical. Metaphorical reference appears to be omnipresent and almost continuous in our use of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. Further, if you believe that our use of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> reflects our underlying cognitive processes, then metaphor is a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> ideational process.</p>
<p>In the second era we shall see the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of the natural <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. The processes controlling the interaction will make greater use of the domain <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how to conduct fluid discourse. Harbingers of naturalness already exist; they are based to a large extent upon pictures. The ONCOCIN project team at Stanford invested a great effort in an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> flow sheet to provide a seamless transition for the oncologist from paper forms for patient <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> entry to <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> versions of these forms. The commercially available <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> tools for expert-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> development sometimes contain elegant and powerful packages for creating pictures that elucidate what the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is doing and what its emerging solution looks like (for example, IntelliCorp's KEE Pictures and Active Images).</p>
<p>Naturalness need not rely upon pictures, of course. The advances in natural-<a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> understanding have been quite substantial, particularly in the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to facilitate understanding. In the second era it will become commonplace for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to interact with users in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, within the scope of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The interaction <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of the second era will increasingly rely on continuous natural speech. In person-to-person interactions, people generally talk rather than type. Typing is useful but unnatural. Speech-understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of wide applicability and based on the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a> are coming. At Stanford we are beginning experiments with an experimental commercial <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>d with the ONCOCIN <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>.</p>
<p>A limitation of first-era <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is their brittleness. To mix metaphors, they operate on a high plateau of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and competence until they reach the extremity of their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>; then they precipitously fall off to levels of utter incompetence. People suffer from the same difficulty (they too cannot escape the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a>, but their fall is more graceful. The cushion for the soft fall is the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and use of weaker but more general models that underlie the highly specific and specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the plateau. For example, if an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er is diagnosing the failure of an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> for which he has no specific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, he can fall back on his <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> analysis, and handbook <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. The capability for such model-based <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is just now under study in many laboratories and will emerge as an important feature of second-era <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. The capability does not come free. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers must explicate and codify general models in a wide variety of task areas.</p>
<p>Task areas? But what if there is no "task"? Can we envision the intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that behaves with <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> at the interstices between tasks or when task <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is completely lacking? <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">Common sense</a> is itself <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, an enormous body of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> distinguished by its ubiquity and the circumstance that it is rarely codified and passed onto others, as more formal <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is. There is, for example, the commonsense fact that pregnancy is associated with <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a>s, not males. The extremely weak but extremely general forms of cognitive behavior implied by commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing constitute for many the ultimate goal in the quest for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers are now beginning the arduous task of understanding the details of the <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> and representation of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and are codifying large bodies of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The first fruits of this will appear in the later <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of the second era. Commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing will probably appear as an unexpected naturalness in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s interaction with an <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligent_agent_entry.html">intelligent agent</a>. As an example of this in medical-consultation advisory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, if pregnancy is mentioned early in the interaction or can be readily inferred, the interaction shifts seamlessly to understanding that a <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> is involved. Magnify this example by one hundred thousand or one million unspoken assumptions, and you will understand what I mean by a large <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> of commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>As <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s expands, so does the scope for modes of <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing that have so far eluded the designers of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Foremost among these modes are <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing by <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> and its sibling metaphorical <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. The essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> has been evident for some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but the details of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>izing have not been. An <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> is a partial match of the description of some current situation with stored <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The extent of the match is crucial. If the match is too partial, then the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> is seen to be vacuous or farfetched; if too complete then the "<a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>" is seen as hardly an <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> at all.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a>izing broadens the relevance of the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>. It can be used to construct interesting and <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> interpretations of situations and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. It can be used to retrieve <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that has been stored, but not stored in the "expected" way. <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a>izing can supply default values for <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s not evident in the description of the current situation. <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a>izing can provide <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to powerful methods that otherwise would not be evoked as relevant. For example, in a famous example from early twentieth century <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, Dirac made the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> between quantum theory and mathematical group theory that allowed him to use the powerful methods of group theory to solve important problems in quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. We shall begin to see <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing by <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> emerge in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of the second era.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a>izing is seen also as an important process in automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> acquisition, another name for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. In first-era <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, adding <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s has been almost always a manual process: people codify <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and place it in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures. Experiments by Douglas Lenat have shown that this laborious process can be semi-automated, facilitated by an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>izing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> suggests the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> to a new situation, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er fills in the details. In the second era we shall see <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s that acquire the details with less or no <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> help. Many other techniques for automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> will find their way into second-era <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. For example, we are currently seeing early experiments on <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> apprentices, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that carefully observe people performing complex tasks and infer thereby the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> needed for competent performance. The second era will also see (I predict) the first successful <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that couple <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> understanding with <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, so that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s can be augmented by the reading of text. Quite likely these will be specialized texts in narrow areas at the outset.</p>
<p>To summarize, because of the increasing power of our concepts and tools and the advent of automatic-<a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> methods, we can expect that during the second era the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will become very large, representing therein hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of facts, <a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">heuristic</a>s, concepts, relationships, and models. Automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> will be facilitated thereby, since by the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_principle_entry.html">knowledge principle</a>, the task of adding <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is performed more competently the more <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is available (the more we know, the easier it is to know more).</p>
<p>Finally, in the second era we will achieve a broad reconceptualization of what we mean by a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Under the broader concept, the "<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s" will be collegial relationships between an intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> and an intelligent person (or persons). Each will perform tasks that he/she/it does best, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will be an emergent of the collaboration. If the interaction is indeed seamless and natural, then it may hardly <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> whether the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> or the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing skills needed are in the head of the person or in the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p><h1>The Far Side of the Dream: The Library of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a></h1><p>Here's a "view from the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>," looking back at our "present," from Professor <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> of MIT: "Can you imagine that they used to have libraries where the books didn't talk to each other?" The libraries of today are warehouses for passive objects. The books and journals sit on shelves waiting for us to use our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to find them, read them, interpret them, and cause them finally to divulge their stored <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> libraries of today are no better. Their pages are pages of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> files, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> pages are equally passive.</p>
<p>Now imagine the library as an active, intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>. It stores the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the disciplines in complex <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures (perhaps in a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-representation formalism yet to be invented). It can <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> with this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to satisfy the needs of its users. These needs are expressed naturally, with fluid discourse. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can, of course, retrieve and exhibit (i.e., it can act as an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> textbook). It can collect relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>; it can summarize; it can pursue relationships. It acts as a consultant on specific problems, offering advice on particular solutions, justifying those solutions with citations or with a fabric of general <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. If the user can suggest a solution or a hypothesis, it can check this and even suggest extensions. Or it can critique the user viewpoint with a detailed rationale of its agreement or disagreement. It pursues relational paths of associations to suggest to the user previously unseen connections. Collaborating with the user, it uses its processes of association and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>izing to brainstorm for remote or <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> concepts. More autonomously, but with some guidance from the user, it uses criteria of being interesting to discover new concepts, methods, theories, and measurements.</p>
<p>The user of the library of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> need not be a person. It may be another <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, that is, any <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligent_agent_entry.html">intelligent agent</a> with a need for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Thus, the library of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will be a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s in which people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s collaborate. Publishing will be an activity transformed. Authors may bypass text, adding their increment to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> directly to the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures. Since the thread of responsibility must be maintained, and since there may be disagreement as <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> grows, the contributions are authored (incidentally allowing for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> of royalties for <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> and use). Maintaining the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> (updating <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>) becomes a vigorous part of the new publishing industry.</p>
<p>At the far horizon the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> can take many forms and dimensions. I have briefly sketched only a few, and I invite you to exercise your imagination to sketch your own. At the far horizon, the question is not "whether," but only "when."</p><h1>Power Tools for the Mind: A Statement of the Encompassing Vision</h1><p>The hard work of the farmer was revolutionized by agricultural <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. The labor of the industrial worker was revolutionized by <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s and heavy <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. As we move toward the postindustrial period of the twenty-first century, as work becomes increasingly the work of professionals and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> workers, the power tools are and will be <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. The economic and social well-being of the advanced societies is increasingly the result of working "smarter" rather than working harder, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are the agents of that change. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> is power, in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> affairs, and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are amplifiers of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. As Carlo De Benedetti, Chief Executive of Olivetti, has said, "For the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of mankind, innovation is the fundamental raw material. Real strategic resources are no longer represented by coal, steel, or oil but by the cleverness and cognitive capability of man."</p>
