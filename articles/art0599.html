<div class="TeaserText">Virtual Humans is the first book with instructions on designing a "V-human," or synthetic person. Using the programs on the included CD, you can create animated computer characters who can speak, dialogue intelligently, show facial emotions,  have a personality and life story, and be used in real business projects. These excerpts explain how to get started.</div>
<br>
<br><i>To be published in </i>Virtual 
            Humans<i>, AMACOM, November 2003. Published on KurzweilAI.net October 
            20, 2003.</i>
<p>About 30% of building a virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>.&#160; A good 
              engine will make it easy for you to create a believable personality.&#160; 
              It provides functions that allow things like handling complex sentences, 
              bringing up the past and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> better responses if one doesn't 
              work. But in the end, it's your artistry that gives the <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> its 
              charm.</p>
<p>There are many <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> approaches that can handle the 
              job. Simple <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> matching engines are the least sophisticated 
              and most useful of them all.&#160; With the rash of recent interest, 
              I'm not going to pretend I know all the nuances of all the engines 
              out there.&#160; Instead, I'll concentrate on using simple <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to 
              build complex personalities.&#160;&#160; Together we will build a clever virtual 
              person using a <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> engine kindly supplied by Yapanda <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>, 
              Inc. of Chickasha Oklahoma. I selected this one because it can drive 
              a real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 3D head animation with lip-synch. Nevertheless, the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> steps in creating a virtual personality are <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> independent.</p>
<p>I've included some additional engines to play with.&#160; The most powerful 
              is <a class="thought" href="entries/alice_entry.html">ALICE</a>.&#160; She's an <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Markup 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/aiml_entry.html">AIML</a>).&#160; Alice <a class="thought" href="entries/source_code_entry.html">source code</a> is available to those of you 
              who want to modify it and build your own Virtual Human engine, adding 
              your own special features.&#160; I've also included a copy of Jacco Bikker's 
              WinAlice for <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> users. It demonstrates some unique features such 
              as the ability to bring up ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and to learn new responses 
              from you.</p>
<p>I'll talk more about the actual engines in chapter three.&#160; But 
              it's <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to realize that the software you use to build your 
              virtual human is just a tool for expressing your artistry.&#160; </p>
<p>The most important and least understood part of virtual humans 
              -- their personalities is our focus.&#160; We are going to have some 
              serious fun.&#160; Let's look at some uses for <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_people_entry.html">virtual people</a>.</p>
<h3>Good For Business</h3>
<p>From a business perspective virtual humans with a personality are 
              a major boon.&#160; Imagine a person signing onto your web page.&#160; There's 
              already a <a class="thought" href="entries/cookie_entry.html">cookie</a> that contains significant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about them, 
              gathered by your virtual host on the guest's first visit.&#160; The encounter 
              might go a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> like this:</p>
<p>Host "Hey, Joanne, Its nice to see you again." &lt;smile&gt;</p>
<p>Joanne: "You remember me?"</p>
<p>Host "Of course I do.&#160; But it's been a while.&#160; I missed you." &lt;expression&gt;</p>
<p>Joanne "Sorry about that, I've been really busy."</p>
<p>Host "So did you read 'The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>?'</p>
<p>Joanne "Yeah, it was really interesting. &lt;beat&gt; Are you one 
              of them?"</p>
<p>Host "Not yet, I'm afraid, but I'm working on it.&lt;beat&gt; Before 
              I forget, you should know about Greg Stock' new book on how to live 
              to be 200 plus years old!"</p>
<p>Joanne "I read his last book and liked it.&#160; Can you send me a copy?"</p>
<p>Host "Sure, we have it in stock &lt;grin&gt;.&#160; Same charge, same 
              place?</p>
<p>Joanne "Yup. Also, do you have any books on Freestyle Landscape 
              Quilting?</p>
<p>Host "I'll check. &lt;beat&gt; Hold on a few more seconds.&#160; Okay, 
              I found two&#8230;..</p>
<p>And so forth. You can see that Virtual humans bring back that personal 
              touch so sorely missing in commerce today. Believe it or not, I've 
              observed people from every level of sophistication and background 
              respond positively to personal attention from a Virtual Human. It 
              feels good.&#160; </p>
<p>Your marketing software can be made to generate marketing variables 
              that can be fed to your virtual human host: Joanne's buying patterns, 
              personal information like her date of birth etc. Trust is a big 
              issue, so such <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> must be handled with respect for the <a class="thought" href="entries/client_entry.html">client</a> 
              and used in clever ways. Imagine when Joanne comes online within 
              a week of her birthday and Host sings happy birthday to her.&#160; Hokey? 
              Yes.&#160; Appealing, you bet.&#160; I've also discovered that many people 
              tolerate hokey behavior from V-people. It's a bit like the ways 
              we tolerate&#8230;even appreciate the squash and stretch exaggeration 
              in animated film characters.&#160; Of course Host would not want to sing 
              happy birthday to every customer.&#160; She has to know how to tell which 
              is which.&#160; Later in the book will look into using unobtrusive personality 
              assessment to provide those cues.&#160; This is one of the most important 
              and most neglected tools you have. You'll see why later.&#160; </p>
<p>An advantage of rule based approaches is that you can have multiple 
              sets of rules, each one with responses specifically honed to a specific 
              task or person or language.&#160; For example when Joanne logs in, her 
              cookie can initiate the <a class="thought" href="entries/uploading_entry.html">uploading</a> of a rule <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> tailored specifically 
              to her general personality and buying patterns. That means that 
              when a rule triggers, it will respond in a way likely to make Jonnie 
              comfortable while meeting her needs. Next a person from Korea logs 
              on and the host <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es to a Korean intelligencebase, greeting 
              the client in that language.&#160; One well designed host can handle 
              orders in more than 20 languages.&#160; This clearly presents opportunities 
              for small companies to expand internationally.</p>
<p>Depending on your type of business or usage, Virtual Human needs 
              will vary. For example, voice-only virtual humans are already very 
              active in phone information and ordering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. They don't have 
              much personality yet, but we're going to work on that. In fact there 
              are a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of different types of virtual humans and we'll be building 
              one up from the simplest to one of the more complex with a 3D animated 
              talking head.&#160; By taking it step by step you'll be amazed at your 
              own ability to master Virtual Human design.</p>
<p>A good Virtual Human should be able to cope with language.&#160; Changing 
              language should be as easy as switching databases and voice engines.&#160; 
              Monica Lamb, a Native American scientist and V-person developer 
              has used Alice to build a V-person that teaches and speaks Mohawk.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>&#160;At a minimum, your V-person will be able to handle general <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>al 
              input by voice or keyboard, parse that input to arrive at appropriate 
              behaviors, and output behavior as text or speech, on-screen information, 
              and/or <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> commands to software or external <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. It should 
              also have a face display capable of at least minimal <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> 
              such as smile, frown and neutral.&#160; I prefer a 3D face capable of 
              complex emotional expression that is part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> system. 
              This is a tall <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, but I believe we can handle it.&#160; Here's and 
              interesting example of how one creative company has used this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              in a mechanical robot: </p>
<p>Redgate Technologies is a company that thrives on <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>. They 
              became interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) early on.&#160; 
              They had invented a new <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> technology to monitor and control complex 
              technical systems. NLP was useful for interpreting the complex codes 
              generated by their chips. Just for fun, they expanded their NLP 
              engine to represent several personalities. They quickly discovered 
              that a virtual human hooked into their system became a super-capable 
              assistant to a human supervisor.&#160; Imagine one on a <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> station, 
              keeping track of all mechanical systems and keeping the inhabitants 
              company with casual conversation. For luck we won't name her <a class="thought" href="entries/hal_entry.html">HAL</a>.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>A wonderful example of this V-person <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> is Redgate's Sarha.&#160; 
              She's an innovative virtual human <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> for industrial monitoring 
              and control.&#160;&#160; Sarha stands for "Smart Anthropomorphic Robotic Hybrid 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">Agent</a>."&#160; Redgate has used NLP pattern matching to monitor an entire 
              industrial complex.&#160;&#160; The Virtual Human system they devised sends 
              out queries to specialized monitoring modules using the special 
              Redgate chips. She then reads and interprets the encoded feedback 
              in spoken English, issuing warnings when conditions warrant.&#160; She 
              can also take emergency <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> on her own, if necessary.&#160; Her supervisor 
              communicates with her in spoken English, asking her to start processes 
              or check specific conditions.&#160;&#160; In a demonstration of Sarha's application 
              to home security, she reported "Anthony, someone left the garage 
              door open."&#160; Anthony replied "Close it for me will you please, Sarha?"&#160; 
              And of course she does.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>The thing I like most about Sarha is her personality. She makes 
              personal comments; even chides her operator, whom she knows by name. 
              As a demonstration, Sarha was installed into a fully robotic interface 
              that could move around, point to <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s and complain about and 
              avoid objects in her path.&#160; She was linked by microwave to a control 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> she used to monitor her charges. She even gave a brief 
              talk on those special chips Redgate designed to transmit monitoring 
              data back to her.&#160; She reached into a bowl, pulled out a chip, pointed 
              at it with a metal finger and started her spiel. Later she took 
              questions.&#160; All the while she was monitoring various systems.&#160; She 
              even brought on-line, a loud monster generator in another room during 
              the demonstration. </p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important applications for Virtual Human 
              technology is in teaching.&#160; I've found that young people have trust 
              issues with the <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al system. I can't blame them when administrators 
              waste millions on bad decisions but there aren't enough books to 
              go around. Virtual teacher's seem separated from all this.&#160; It's 
              hard to <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> ulterior motives to an animated character, even 
              if she is smart and talkative and knows you by name.&#160; Properly scripted, 
              a V-teacher can get to know a student on a personal basis.&#160; The 
              real human teacher can feed her personal tidbits she can bring up 
              during a lesson:</p>
<p>"So Bill, is it true you threw the winning touchdown in Saturday's 
              game?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, how'd you know about that?"</p>
<p>" Hey, I keep on top of things.&#160; Congratulations.&#160; Now let's teach 
              you how to estimate the diameter of an oleic acid <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. </p>
<p>Young children can be fascinated by virtual people.&#160; I got a call 
              from a retired engineer from rural New Mexico.&#160; He had spent a lot 
              of time tweaking the voice input on his V-person so that she would 
              understand his very bright 3 year old grand daughter, and had a 
              story to tell me.&#160; He'd been remarkably successful and the little 
              girl spent hours in happy conversation with her virtual friend.&#160; 
              One evening a few neighbors came by to play Canasta.&#160; While they 
              were playing, the little girl came into the adjoining room and fired 
              up her computer.&#160;&#160; In moments an animated conversation ensued.&#160; 
              One of the neighbors, a devout fundamentalist Christian became terrified 
              and insisted he smash the girl's computer immediately. It was inhabited 
              by the devil.&#160;&#160; He refused of course. He told me he'd been using 
              the virtual character to teach his grand daughter everything from 
              her ABCs to simple math.&#160; I gave him some unpublished information 
              on how to get her to record the granddaughter's responses to questions, 
              so he could check on them later.</p>
<p>The point is, in creative hands virtual humans already have enormous 
              potential and the platforms are constantly improving.</p>
<p>Blending <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, technology and a little <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> allows us to take 
              a functional leap, decades ahead of pure artificial intelligence. 
              Although the simple VH software of today will eventually be replaced 
              by highly sophisticated neural nets or entirely new kinds of computing, 
              it will be a long time before they'll have unique human like personalities&#8230;if 
              ever.&#160; Meanwhile let's give the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of technology a kick in 
              the butt by building really smart, personable virtual people today.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Because creating a believable synthetic personality is more of 
              an art than <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, it's important that we get a feel for how we 
              humans handle our conscious lives. It's part <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, part psychology

<h3>Synthespians: Virtual Acting (Chapter 13)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>with <a href="#hooks">Ed Hooks</a>
<p> </p>
<p>Virtual people have to convince us they have wheels spinning inside. 
              They do, of course, have <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s spinning in service of the plot, 
              but if they don't show it on their faces, we just don't buy it. 
              We're used to seeing people think. It's true; <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> is conveyed 
              through action. 
            <p> Although I'm remarkably opinionated about acting in animation, 
              I'm not a certified expert on the subject--Ed Hooks is. He teaches 
              acting classes for animators internationally, and has held workshops 
              for companies such as Disney Animation (Sydney), Tippett Studio 
              (Berkeley), <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, Washington), <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Arts (Los 
              Angeles), BioWare (Edmonton, Canada), and PDI (Redwood City, California). 
              Among his five books, Acting for Animators: The Complete Guide to 
              Performance Animation. , Heinemann; Revised edition (September 2003) 
              has been a major hit. 
            <p> </p>
<h3>The Seven Essential <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">Concept</a>s in Face Acting</h3>
            The following concepts are interpretations of Ed Hooks' "Seven 
            Essential Acting Concepts." We've adapted them here to focus 
            on the V-people and their faces. 
            <p> 1. The face expresses thoughts beneath. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, real or artificial, 
              is the most alive part of us. <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a>, awareness, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing 
              are active processes that affect what's on our face. Emotion happens 
              as a result of thinking. Because these characters don't have a natural 
              link between thinking and facial expression, your job as animator 
              is to create those links. In effect, you want your synthetic brain 
              to emulate recognizable human cognition on the face, which leads 
              to the illusion of real and appropriate emotions. 
            <p> 2. Acting is reacting. Every facial expression is a reaction to 
              something. Even the slightest head and hand movement in reaction 
              to what's happening can be most convincing. If the character tilts 
              its head as you begin to speak to it, or nods on occasion in agreement, 
              you get the distinct feeling of a living person paying attention. 
              A double take shows surprise. Because you have very few body parts 
              to work with, you have a superb challenge in front of you. 
            <p> 3. Know your character's objective. Your character is never static. 
              He is always moving, even if the movement is the occasional twitch, 
              a shift of the eye, or a blink. Your objective is to endow your 
              character with the illusion of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. As such, it is wise to follow 
              Shakespeare's advice, "Hold the mirror up to nature" (Hamlet, 
              III. ii.17-21). Notice that when a person listens, she may tilt 
              her head to the side or glance off in the distance as she contemplates 
              and integrates new information. When she smiles and says nice things 
              to you, her objective is to please. Always know what your character's 
              objective is because it is the roadmap linking behaviors to their 
              goals. Knowing her personality and history are essential here. 
            <p> 4. Your character moves continuously from action to action. Your 
              character is doing something 100 percent of the time. There must 
              always be life! Even if she appears to be waiting, things are going 
              on mentally. Make a list of boredom behaviors and use them. When 
              people talk, a good emotion extraction engine will feed her cues 
              on how to react to what's being said. Her actions expressing emotional 
              responses are fluid. They flow into each other forming a face story. 
              You should be able to tell from the character's expression how she's 
              reacting to what you're saying. Say she takes a deep breath and 
              you see the cords on her neck tighten. They then relax. Her body 
              slumps a bit and perhaps she nods. Always in <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, she maintains 
              the illusion of life. 
            <p> 5. All action begins with movement. You can't even do math without 
              your face moving, exposing wheels spinning beneath. Your eyes twitch. 
              You glance at the ceiling, pondering. Your brow furrows as you struggle 
              with the solution. Try this <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>: Ask a friend to lie as still 
              as possible on the floor. No movement at all. Then, when he is absolutely 
              stone still, ask him to multiply 36 by 38. Pay close attention to 
              his eyes. You will note that they immediately begin to shift and 
              move. It is impossible to carry out a mental calculation without 
              the eyes moving. Sometimes movement on the screen needs to be a 
              bit more overt than in real life. That's okay, even essential. It 
              nails down the emotion. Done right, people won't notice the exaggeration, 
              but will get the point. 
            <p> 6. Empathy is audience glue. The main transaction between humans 
              and Virtual humans has to be emotion, not words. Words alone will 
              lose them. You will catch a viewer's attention if your character 
              appears to be thinking, but you will engage your viewer emotionally 
              if your character appears to be feeling. You must get across how 
              this V-person feels about what's going on. If you do it successfully, 
              the audience will care about (empathize with) those feelings. I 
              promise you it can be done. A great autonomous character can addict 
              an audience in ways a static animation cannot. The transaction between 
              audience and character is in real-time and directly motivated, much 
              as it is on stage. This is a unique acting medium, which is part 
              live performance and part animation. It's an opportunity for you 
              to push things--experiment with building empathy pathways. 
            <p> 7. Interaction requires negotiation. You want a little theatrical 
              heat in any discourse with a V-person. To accomplish this, remember 
              that your character always has choices. We all do, in every waking 
              moment. The character has to decide when and whether to answer or 
              initiate a topic. If your character is simply mouthing words, your 
              audience response will be boredom. Whether they know it or not, 
              people want to be entertained by your character. Artonin Artaud 
              famously observed that "actors are athletes of the heart." 
              Dead talk is not entertaining. There must be emotion. Recognize 
              that you're working with a theatrical situation and that the viewer 
              will crave more than a static picture. 
            <p> Sure, there are loads more acting concepts we could talk about, 
              but these seven are the hard-rock core of it. You're faced with 
              a unique acting challenge because you have an animated character 
              that is essentially alive. If that character is a cartoon or <a class="thought" href="entries/anime_entry.html">anime</a> 
              design and personality, you'll have to read Preston Blair , for 
              example, to learn the principles of exaggerated cartoon acting, 
              and then incorporate these squash and stretch type actions into 
              your character's personality. If you take the easier road and use 
              a photorealistic human actor, you still must make their actions 
              a bit larger than life, but not as magnified as cartoons demand. 
            <p> The stage you <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> will depend on the Virtual actor's intention. 
              If he's there to guide a person around a no-nonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> Web 
              site, you'll need to think hard about how much <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a> to 
              inject. Certainly you need some. Intelligent Virtual actors in games 
              situations--especially full-bodied ones--present marvelous opportunities 
              to expand this new field of acting. You'll know their intentions. 
              Let them lead you to design their actions. Embellish their personalities, 
              embroider their souls, and decorate their actions. Making them bigger 
              than life will generally satisfy. 
            <h3> Synthespians: The Early Years</h3>
<p> Next I want to tell you about the clever term "Synthespian," 
              which unfortunately I didn't coin. I do believe it should become 
              a part of our language. 
            <p> Diana Walczak and <a class="thought" href="entries/kleiser_entry.html">Jeff Kleiser</a> produced some early experimental 
              films featuring excellent solo performances by <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> human characters. 
              For example, Nestor Sextone for President premiered at SIGGRAPH 
              in 1988. About a year later, Kleiser and Walczak presented the <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> 
              Synthespian, Dozo, in a <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> video: "Don't Touch Me." 
              These were not <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligent_agent_entry.html">intelligent agent</a>s, but they were good actors. "It 
              was while we were writing Nestor's speech to an assembled group 
              of "synthetic thespians" that we coined the term "Synthespian," 
              explains Jeff Kleiser. Nestor Sextone had to be animated from digitized 
              models sculpted by Diana Walczak. 
            <p> As history will note, the field of digital animation is a close, 
              almost incestuous one. Larry Weinberg, the fellow who later created 
              Poser, worked out some neat software that allowed Jeff and Diana 
              to link together digitized facial expressions created from multiple 
              maquettes she'd sculpted to define visemes. That same software allowed 
              them to animate Nestor's emotional expression. I've put a copy of 
              this wonderful classic bit of animation on the <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a>, with their 
              blessing. 
            <p> Note that this viseme-linking was an early part of the development 
              chain leading to the morph targets you see in Poser and all the 
              high-end animation suites today. Getting your digitized character 
              to act was difficult in those days before bones, articulated joints, 
              and morphing skin made movement realistic. Nestor was made up of 
              interpenetrating parts that had to be cleverly animated to look 
              like a gestalt character without any obvious cracks or breaks or 
              parts sticking out. 
            <p> In most cases, V-people don't have a full body to work with, just 
              a face, and perhaps hands. Body language is such an effective communications 
              tool, but when we just don't have it we end up putting twice as 
              much effort into face and upper body acting. Fortunately a properly 
              animated face can be wonderfully expressive, as shown in Figure 
              13-1.

<h3> Synthespians All Have a Purpose</h3>
<p> A Synthespian playing a living person is probably the trickiest 
              circumstance you'll encounter. Depending on the situation, you want 
              to emulate that person's real personality closely, or exaggerate 
              it for comedic impact or political statement. If you exaggerate 
              features and behavior heavily you've entered a new art form: interactive 
              caricature or parody. 
            <p> Let's say we've built a synthetic Secretary of Defense Donald 
              Rumsfeld. The interactive theatrical situation is that we are interrupting 
              him while he is hectically planning an attack somewhere in the world. 
              He might be impatient and have an attitude regarding our utter stupidity 
              and lack of patriotism for bothering him at a time like this. His 
              listening skills might be shallow. He might continually give off 
              the dynamic that he has better things to do. By thus exaggerating 
              his personality, we create interest and <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>. As a user, you want 
              to interact because you feel something interesting is happening. 
              There is comic relief, and all the while this character is making 
              a political statement. I suspect Rumsfeld would get a kick out of 
              such a representation, as long as it's done in good taste. 
            <p> Action conveys personality, and you can't set up a virtual actor 
              without knowing the character well. For example, Kermit the Frog 
              has a definite psychology behind him. As a Web host, he is just 
              very happy to be there. He enjoys being in the spotlight, and his 
              behavior strongly implies he doesn't want to be any place else. 
              He's happy to show you around his Web site, and he might even break 
              out in song along the way. Occasionally he'll complain about Miss 
              Piggy's lack of attention or the disadvantages of his verdant complexion. 
            <p> Think first about your intention and then the character's intention. 
              Mae West and Will Rogers wanted to make 'em laugh. No <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what 
              your purpose for a Synthespian, you want it to entertain. Sometimes 
              it may be understated. Remember that cleverness is always in style. 
              Notice the look people get on their faces when they think they're 
              being clever. It's usually an understated cockiness that shows around 
              the eyes. The intention is to be clever, the words are smart, but 
              remember to add that subtle touch of smugness or self-satisfaction 
              around the eyes and the corners of the mouth. 
            <p> Note: There is a new book titled Emotions Revealed: Recognizing 
              Faces and Feelings to Improve Communication and Emotional Life, 
              by Paul Ekman (Times Books, 2003), which is well worth your time 
              to read. Ekman, who is professor of psychology in the department 
              of psychiatry at the University of California Medical School, San 
              Francisco, is one of the world's great <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a>es on the subject of 
              the expression of emotion in the human face. His new book has more 
              than one hundred photographs of nuanced facial expression, complete 
              with explanations for the variances. 
            <p> As an aside, I used to train counter-terrorist agents in psychological 
              survival. One way to spot a terrorist in a crowd is that they often 
              have facial expressions that are inappropriate to the situation. 
              I used Ekman's work as a reference to help my agents recognize when 
              facial expression and body language don't match up, an indication 
              often exhibited by potential terrorists. You can use Ekman's work 
              to make sure your V-human agents have appropriate expressions for 
              the situation. 
            <h3> You Are the Character</h3>
<p> When you've done your homework, you'll know your character like 
              you know yourself. You'll identify with the character so intensely 
              you will have the sensation of being that character. Stage actors 
              learn to create characters by shifting from the third person to 
              the first person reference. Instead of saying, "My character 
              would be afraid in this situation," a stage actor might say, 
              while portraying the character, "I feel afraid." In your 
              case, you are creating a second-party character, but you're empathizing 
              personality with the emotions of your own creation. There is an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> between the two of you that will be both fun and compelling. 
            <p> Designing animation <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s for the character requires feeling 
              them. I remember watching my daughter as she animated a baby dragon 
              early in her career. Her natural <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a> was to get inside that 
              baby dragon and be it. I smiled as I watched her body and face contort 
              as she acted out each part of the sequence. Her instruction had 
              not come from me&#8230;it was intuitive. At Disney, I've watched 
              animators making faces in little round mirrors dangling from extension 
              arms above their desks. They glance in the mirror, make a face and 
              then look at the cel and try to capture what they've seen. That 
              part hasn't changed. For us it's glance at the mirror, glance at 
              the screen, and then tweak a spline or morph setting. You won't 
              be able to do all this with the simple animation tools I've given 
              you for free. Those are just to get you hooked. If you intend to 
              learn this stuff, get ready to invest heavily in time and commitment 
              and a fair amount in coin as well. A small investment considering 
              the return. 
            <h3> If You Want to Go Further</h3>
<p> There are great animation schools, and this continent has some 
              of the best. My favorite is at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario. 
              But there are many good schools here in the United States as well. 
              A few years ago, most of them were a waste of money. But things 
              have improved. Do some Web <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and find which school can best 
              help you meet your goals. There is a long-term need for talented, 
              well-trained character animators, and in general the pay for the 
              talented is phenomenal. 
            <p> If you're a developer, you have to be familiar with all this stuff 
              to manage it effectively. You're responsible for the final product. 
              If you have animators working for you, believe in them, give them 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>, but guide them toward your vision as well. The best animated 
              characters reflect the <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, vision, and artistry of their prime 
              artists and the producers behind them. A great producer is an artist, 
              a business person, and a technician. It's not easy to get there, 
              and too may producers only have the business end down. As a producer, 
              you have to understand the artistry of production. You have to feel 
              the emotion of good animation. How else will you know what to approve 
              and not approve. So learn it and you'll be way above the crowd. 
            <p> I want to thank Ed Hooks for contributing his wisdom to this chapter. 
              Remember, what you've read here is just a taste of what you need 
              to learn. If you're lucky, you'll find a way to take a live class 
              with Ed, who now lives in the Chicago area. It will change your 
              perspective forever. 
            <p> In the chapter upcoming, I'm going to kick it up a notch with 
              ways to give your character true awareness of his surroundings. 
              Imagine your well-developed character, now able not only to listen 
              and talk, but actually to see you, look you in the eyes, and recognize 
              you without asking. You don't want to miss this one.

So the challenge I can envision to this whole accelerating field of virtual humans is to start even now the direction of virtual simulation of living individuals, which can later lead according to the points mentioned to digital survival or digital immortality or at least a good backup copy of someone in case anything else in his survival strategy will go awry.  firstly i am intended to offer this project to Ray Kurzweil.

<br>
I noticed that real people were refered in the masculine and artifical ones femine.
<br>
  Let me bring your attenttion to the fact that women are real beings with souls.
<br>
<br>
A woman may choose an artifical character in female likeness just a a guy may choose an artificaial character in male likeness to represent himself.
<br>
<br>
Human techology has evolved greatly,throughout the centuries stil you fail to see the fact that women are subjects, living souls.  A woman's body is her object, but she  is the living concious soul or creator.
<br>
<br>
Also, a  a guy is his conciousness who uses his body a.k.a. body.
<br>
<br>
Women are the creator of the creation.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I am confident that the AI will produce convincing "actors" in the phenomenological sense in time, but I do loath all these needed, clumsy and desperate attempts to get us there. To put forth the example image as displayed above to illustrate "convincing" emotion is delusional. Our thresholds for realism are MUCH higher than this. Remember the story of the birds landing to eat the grapes from the 5th c. BC painter Zeuxis. Our threshold of "realism has come a ways since the, lets just say that representational conventions you hold forth as examples are ridiculous. 
<br>
<br>
Take  as an an example animated movie (I understand AI is not a movie) it does not look real. You may experience emotion in the viewing experience but no one mistakes it for real "emotion" being displayed in the characters. It should also be noted that human "actors" in the theatrical sense, actually have an internal reference points when it comes to displaying "convincing" emotions and this is what facilitates the seeming realism.
<br>
<br>
It would likely be useful to map the faces of actors providing highly convincing performances to generate the emotional lexicon for facial expression the other route would be to hook your own face up and map it while in "genuine" states of despair joy or boredom and so on. Just a thought.</p></td>
