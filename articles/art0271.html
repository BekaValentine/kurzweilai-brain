<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>'s keynote address delivered at "Connections," American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>, April 28, 1996.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally presented April 28, 1996. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 8, 2001.</p>
<p>My parents were from Vienna and liked to tell this story:</p>
<p>Four pastry shops competed on the same street eking out a living, but the market demand was not sufficient to support four shops. So one shop brought in a management expert, and the next morning, there was a small sign in the window "Best Pastries in Vienna," and they started to get a lot of curious pastry shoppers.</p>
<p>So the second shop brought in their own turnaround consultant and the next morning there was a bigger sign in their window, "Best Pastries in Austria."</p>
<p>The third shop followed suit with a really big six foot high sign, "Best Pastries in Europe."</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth shop owner decided that she needed to do something as well and the next morning there was a really big sign that took up the entire window, "Best Pastries on this Block."</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that you don't have to be the best in the world, you only have to be on the best in your neighborhood and you have to be in the right field.</p>
<p>In the Vienna of 1930, the right field was pastries. I grew up eating those Viennese pastries, but I don't eat them anymore--not since my nutrition book came out.</p>
<p>In 1995, the right field is <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. But you don't have to be in the right neighborhood anymore. It doesn't <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> whether you're in Vienna, or Massachusetts, or Tel Aviv, because the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is the great leveler, the great equalizer--everyone has ready <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the marketplace. A couple of Yahoos in California can be as prominent as <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>I was in Israel last Summer, and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/export_entry.html">export</a> markets used to be a big issue, but with the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, high tech and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> in particular is booming, so Israel today has a GNP that is twice that of Saudi Arabia. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> and the intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> it represents exceeds the value of oil. I'll come back to Israel in a moment.</p>
<p>Some of you remember the movie "The Graduate." For some of you, it may be before your time but you remember the enigmatic advice that Dustin Hoffman received... I don't remember the name of his character... I remember <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> at the time, plastics?? Even then I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> "computers" would have been better advice.</p>
<p>Today, the advice would be <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Some might say <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, but in my view that is just another manifestation of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. After all, <a class="thought" href="entries/netscape_entry.html">Netscape</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> company.</p>
<p>You've no doubt noticed the extraordinary value of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> companies, including, not so incidentally Israel <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> companies. There is a great migration of American venture capitalists going to Israel and investing in Israel <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> startups.</p>
<p>One of the best things that has happened to the Israel economy was the influx of Russian immigrants--very talented and educated people--doctors, mathematicians. They weren't able to get jobs, so they started <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> companies.</p>
<p>In my view, this is not a passing trend, it is not a bubble that's going to burst, which is not to say that there will never be a correction or that none of today's high flyers will crash, but what we are seeing today is a fundamental transformation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> away from commodities and toward <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, as embodied in <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, you can draw a reverse exponential curve where the y axis is the percentage of value of a product represented by natural resources and the x axis is time, and the percentage of value represented by natural resources is asymptoting to zero as we go forward in time, and every product and service is on the curve. Some are closer to zero than others, and some categories of products are moving faster than others as they move down the curve, but every product is on the curve, marching on down to nearly zero contribution from material resources and nearly 100% contribution from intellect.</p>
<p>Indeed, over the past twenty years the value of commodity resources, as measured in constant dollars, has fallen substantially, about 40 percent, and this trend is accelerating. So, sell short on your natural resource stocks. That will be my only stock tip for today.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not an economist but that doesn't inhibit me from sharing with you economic opinions. Very few people are inhibited from expressing economic opinions. That is, I am sure, very frustrating to economists.</p>
<p>My own background is in signal processing and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, and very few people express opinions about signal processing and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. But everyone likes to express their economic views.</p>
<p>I'm reminded of the <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> professor who year after year has the questions to his final exam stolen by his students, and explains why he's really not upset about this. The questions are always the same anyway, he points out, it's the correct answers that keep changing.</p>
<p>A lot of people feel that's why <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> differs from <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. But if you pay close attention to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> you know that the correct answers keep changing here, too.</p>
<p>Today, the correct answer to the question of how to advance economic competitiveness is to foster the creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, that is, sequences of 1's and 0's--one might say protected sequences of 1's and 0's that have economic value. And that has not always been the case in human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>Now, what is fueling this extraordinary and in my view permanent shift to <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, to <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>, to <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> as the foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and power in this <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a>?</p>
<p>The answer in my view is <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a>. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> is the driving force behind a revolution so vast that the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> revolution to date represents only a minor ripple of its ultimate implications.</p>
<p>Okay, now what is <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a>? How many of you are familiar with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a>? <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> states that computing speeds and densities double every 18 months. In other words, every 18 months we can buy a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that is twice as fast and has twice as much <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> for the same cost.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> actually is corollary of a broader law I like to call <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s law on the exponentially quickening pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that goes back to the dawn of human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>--I mean not much happened in the tenth century, technologically speaking. In the eighteenth century, quite a bit happened. Now we have major <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> shifts in a few years time? But that's another speech.</p>
<p>But with regard to <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a>: Remarkably, this law has held true since the beginning of this century, from the mechanical card-based computing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the 1890 census, to the relay-based computers of the 1940s, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>-based computers of the 1950s, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>-based machines of the 1960s, to all of the generations of integrated circuits that we've seen over the past 25 years.</p>
<p>If you put every <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for the past 100 years on a logarithmic chart, it makes an essentially straight line.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, for example, is about 16,000 times more powerful today for the same unit cost as it was about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is 150 million times more powerful for the same unit cost than it was in 1948, the year I was born. If the automobile industry had made as much <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the past forty-five years, a car today would cost about a hundredth of a cent, and would go faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> will continue unabated for many decades to come. We have not even begun to explore the third dimension in chip design. Chips today are flat, whereas our brain is organized in three dimensions. We live in a three-dimensional world; why not use the third dimension?</p>
<p>Improvements in <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> materials, including the development of superconducting circuits that do not generate heat, will enable the development of chips, or I should say cubes, with thousands of layers of circuitry, which when combined with far smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> geometries, will improve computing power by a factor of many millions. There are more than enough new computing technologies being developed to assure a continuation of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> for a very long time.</p>
<p>The implications of this geometric trend can be understood by recalling the legend of the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of chess and his patron, the emperor of China. The emperor had so fallen in love with his new game, he offered the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> a reward of anything he wanted in the kingdom. "Just one grain of rice on the first square, your Majesty." "Just one grain of rice?" "Yes, your Majesty, just one grain of rice on the first square, and two grains of rice on the second square, four on the third square, and so on."</p>
<p>Well, the emperor immediately granted the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>'s seemingly humble request. One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt because the doubling of grains of rice for each square ultimately equaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. Another version has the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> losing his head. It's not yet clear which outcome we are headed for.</p>
<p>But there is one thing that we should take note of. It was fairly uneventful as the emperor and the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> went through the first half of the chessboard. After 32 squares, the emperor had given the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> about 8 billion grains of rice.</p>
<p>That's a reasonable quantity of rice--it's about one field's worth--and the emperor did start to take notice. But the emperor could still remain an emperor, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> could still retain his head. It was as they headed into the second half of the chessboard, that at least one of them got into trouble.</p>
<p>So where do we stand now? Well, there have been exactly 32 doublings of performance since the first operating computers were built in the 1940s. So where we stand right now, is that we've just finished the first half of the chess board. And indeed people are starting to take notice.</p>
<p>But now as we head into the rest of the nineties, and the next century, we are heading into the second half of the chessboard, and that is where things start to get interesting.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> is providing us the infrastructure in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> to embody all of our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and methodologies and to harness them on inexpensive platforms.</p>
<p>It enables us to live in a world today in which all of our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, all of our creations, all of insights, all of our ideas, our cultural expressions--pictures, movies, art, sound, music, books and the secret of life itself--are all being digitized captured and understood in sequences of ones and zeroes.</p>
<p>I speak to many different groups: <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists and engineers, librarians, musicians, magazine publishers, doctors, graphic artists, architects, researchers of different kinds. All of them, in diverse ways, are experiencing the same thing: the digitization of their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> bases, their methods and the expressions of their work.</p>
<p>Just to make the point, let's consider one example in a field I've had some <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in, musical instruments. The percentage of value represented by natural resources and labor for instruments using the nineteenth century acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, such as pianos with their hundreds of feet of wire, and hundreds of pounds of metal and wood, is very high--it's about 60 to 70%. For <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> musical instruments, which are basically computers, the figure is closer to 5% and in this industry, we are gradually replacing <a class="thought" href="entries/acoustics_entry.html">acoustics</a> with electronics.</p>
<p>Consider pianos. And by the term piano, I am not referring to synthesizers, but rather to instruments that you put in your living room for your eight-year-old daughter to use while she's taking piano lessons.</p>
<p>Six years ago, the percentage of pianos that used <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was 4%. Today, it's 60%, and again I'm not including synthesizers or portable keyboards. In two to three years, that figure is expected to hit 80%. So, if you take the industry as a whole, ten years ago, the value of musical instruments was 60% natural resources, today it's down to 20% and in five years, it will be 10%.</p>
<p>Now with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a> as our road map, I'd like to share with you a few of lessons I've noticed in the 35 years I've been in this industry.</p>
<p>Lesson one is to always consider where we are on Moore's path, to consider the pace of change. It's not sufficient to target an <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> at today's needs using today's <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is increasing at a geometric pace. Product lifetimes for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> products average two years. For <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, you've got 6 to 12 months and these periods continue to get shorter. Typically, it takes several years to develop a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and another year or so to develop a product. Your product has got to make sense when its completed, not when the development <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is started.</p>
<p>Fred Zieber, Senior Vice President of Dataquest, said that "Every <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> product being sold today is obsolete." He said that five years ago, but it's even more true today. The failure of an enterprise is frequently the result of a miscalculation is assessing the rates of change in either the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the market needs, the channels of distribution, or perhaps all of the above, or, incredibly, in the common failure to even consider that the world two years from now will be a very different place than it is today.</p>
<p>A second lesson is to determine what your real expertise is, to determine where you have a sustainable competitive edge and then forge a series of alliances. Don't worry if the alliances are strategic or tactical, so long as they allow you to concentrate on where you can make a unique contribution.</p>
<p>A third lesson is that a good way to resolve a dispute is with an agreement that can be viewed, and that indeed does represent a win-win for both parties. A resolution that requires one side or another to admit a defeat may be too difficult and not be worth the time and trouble.</p>
<p>A fourth lesson is to harness the scientific and educational resources in your midst.</p>
<p>When I spoke to the Gartner Group last Summer with Shimon Peres last Summer, he articulated all of these themes very eloquently.</p>
<p>With regard to <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a>, he spoke of a changing world where <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, particularly <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, is erasing borders.</p>
<p>Consider missile <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which is one manifestation of computers and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, a missile does not respect borders.</p>
<p>Consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, another manifestation of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> represents a global market, where products and <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> flow across borders with great ease, which is of some consternation to tariff collectors.</p>
<p>With regard to the second lesson--knowing where one's real expertise is--Israel is demonstrating its expertise in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, through such scientific and educational institutions as the Weizmann Institute. This expertise is already very well manifest in the enormous impact Israel's high tech sector is having on its own economy and that of the Mideast in general.</p>
<p>In terms of dispute resolution, we can view the current peace process as one where all parties have a stake and are already benefiting in terms of increased economic activity and cooperation.</p>
<p>With regard to the fourth lesson, I used to wonder some years ago why Tel Aviv and Israel was not a great <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> center like Massachusetts and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a>. But now that Israel is devoting more of its resources and brain power to its economy, and there is somewhat less requirement to invest such a large portion of these resources into the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> sector, we are now indeed seeing Israel as one of the world's leading centers for <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> development.</p>
<p>As a final note, I want to underscore the revolutionary <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a> Another revolutionary, Mao Tse Tung, said that power comes from the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>And that statement was true when he said it. But he said it in the last possible decade that one could make that statement. Because through physical coercion you could control natural resources. If you could control natural resources and compel people to labor, you could control <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>. And while not providing the happiest or most productive or workers, it worked well enough.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/second_industrial_rev_entry.html">second industrial revolution</a>, however, the one that is now in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, is based on machines that extend, multiply and leverage not our physical but our mental abilities.</p>
<p>A remarkable aspect of this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is that it uses almost no natural resources. <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> chips use infinitesimal amounts of sand and other readily available materials. They use insignificant amounts of electricity. It's a fortunate truth of human <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that whereas labor can be forced, <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and innovation cannot be.</p>
<p>But there's something else Mao said that is true today, although not in the sense that he meant it and that is the desirability of permanent revolution.</p>

<p>It's not just that densities of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> double and that computing speeds double, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a> constantly changes everything--the needs of the market the methods of development, the channels of distribution.</p>
<p>It is a continual <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>, and to understand how to revitalize a company or a country with significant <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> assets, one needs to understand how that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will fit into not just the world of today, but the world one year from now, and two years from now, which will be very different.</p>

<a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> is full of missed <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> shifts. When the telephone was first invented, the chief engineer of the British post office said "this is no big deal, we have plenty of messenger boys."

<br>
I just want to add one aspect.  The Open Source movement will redistribute wealth among the IT companies and nations.  The USA has said no thanks, by accepting the software patents laws and maybe the European Union is accepting software patents now in 2005. Then the main stream in IT development will be given to the developing world as a very powerful weapon.  Sooner or later this will cause the IT giants to fall.
<br>
I hope Israel will see the potential here.  Whit the double license model used by MySQL you have the best solution for making big money and still keeping the source code open.
<br>
<br>
When the source is open you cannot stop the development of the code.  Read "Just for Fun" by Linus Torvalds the brain behind LINUX.
