</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">Mathematics</a> has often been viewed as the ultimate formalization of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process, at least of the rational side of it. As I noted in the last chapter (and as was noted in several of the contributed articles at the end of the last chapter), the relationship of logic and the analytic process underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> to cognition has been debated through the ages by philosophers, many of whom were also mathematicians. The actual deployment of mathematical techniques to emulate at least certain aspects of human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> was not feasible until the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> became available after World War II. However, the foundations of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> theory, along with the <a class="thought" href="entries/set_theory_entry.html">set theory</a> on which <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> theory is based, were established long before the potential of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> to revolutionize applied <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> was realized.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">Mathematics</a> has often been described as a branch of <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, the branch most concerned with logic.<sup>3</sup> It has only been in this century that the fields of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> have split into largely distinct disciplines with few major figures doing important work in both areas. Bertrand Russell, having been a pivotal figure in the establishment of both modern <a class="thought" href="entries/set_theory_entry.html">set theory</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/logical_positivism_entry.html">logical positivism</a>, was perhaps the last.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Russell\'s%20Paradox')">Russell's Paradox</a></h1><p>In the early part of this century Bertrand Russell, a young and as yet relatively unknown mathematician and philosopher, became increasingly occupied with a certain type of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> and attempts to understand its implications. The resolution of the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> had important implications for the subsequent development of the theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. The following story illustrates Russell's class of paradoxes:<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>A judge is sentencing a man for a crime that he finds reprehensible and for which he wishes to mete out the most severe sentence he can think of. So he tells the convicted man not only that he is sentenced to die but also that because his crime was so offensive, the sentence is to be carried out in a unique way. "The sentence is to be carried out quickly," the judge says. "It must be carried out no later than next Saturday. Furthermore, I want the sentence to be carried out in such a way that on the morning of your execution, you will not know for certain that you are going to be executed on that day. When we come for you, it will be a surprise."</p>
<p>When the judge finished describing his unusual sentence, the condemned man seemed surprisingly pleased and replied, "Well, that's great, judge, I am greatly relieved."</p>
<p>To this the judge said, "I don't understand, how can you be relieved? I have condemned you to be executed, I have asked that the sentence be carried out soon, but you will be unable to prepare yourself because on the morning that your sentence is to be carried out, you will not know for certain that you will die that day."</p>
<p>The convicted man said, "Well, your honor, in order for your sentence to be carried out, I could not be executed on Saturday."</p>
<p>"Why is that?" asked the judge.</p>
<p>"Because since the sentence must be carried out by Saturday, if we actually get to Saturday, I will know for certain that I am to be executed on that day, and thus it would not be a surprise."</p>
<p>"I suppose you are right," replied the judge. "You cannot be executed on Saturday. I still do not see why you are relieved."</p>
<p>"Well," said the prisoner, "if we have definitely ruled out Saturday, then I cannot be executed on Friday either."</p>
<p>"Why is that?" asked the judge.</p>
<p>"We have agreed that I definitely cannot be executed on Saturday. Therefore, Friday is the last day I can be executed. Thus, if Friday rolls around, I will definitely know that I am to be executed on that day, and therefore it would not be a surprise. So I cannot be executed on Friday."</p>
<p>"I see," said the judge.</p>
<p>"Thus, the last day I can be executed would be Thursday. But if Thursday rolls around, I would know I had to be executed on that day, and thus it would not be a surprise. So Thursday is out. By the same reasoning we can eliminate Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday, and today."</p>
<p>The judge scratched his head as the confident prisoner was led back to his prison cell.</p>
<p>There is an epilogue to the story. On Thursday the prisoner was taken to be executed. And he was very surprised. So the judge's orders were successfully carried out.</p>
<p>If we analyze the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> contained in the above story, we see that the conditions that the judge has set up result in a conclusion that none of the days meets, because, as the prisoner so adroitly points out, each one of them in turn would not be a surprise. But the <i>conclusion itself</i> changes the situation, and now surprise <i>is</i> possible again. This brings us back to the original situation in which the prisoner could (in theory) demonstrate that each day in turn would be impossible, and so on. The judge applies <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Alexander\'s%20Solution')">Alexander's solution</a> to this <a class="thought" href="entries/gordian_knot_entry.html">Gordian knot</a>.</p>
<p>A simpler example and the one that Russell actually struggled with is the following question about sets: Consider set <i>A</i>, which is defined to contain all sets that are not members of themselves. Does set <i>A</i> contain itself? As we consider this famous problem, our first realization is that there are only two possible answers: yes and no. We can therefore exhaustively consider all of the possible answers (this is not the case for many problems in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>). Let us try "yes." If the answer is yes, then set <i>A</i> does contain itself. But if set <i>A</i> contains itself, then according to its defining condition set <i>A</i> would not belong to set <i>A</i>, and thus it does not belong to itself. Since the assumption that <i>A</i> contains itself led to a contradiction, it must have been wrong. If the answer is "no," then set <i>A</i> does not contain itself. But again according to the defining condition, if set <i>A</i> does not belong to itself, then it would belong to set <i>A</i>. As with the story about the prisoner, we have contradictory propositions that imply one another. The assumption of no yields yes, which yields no, and so on.</p>
<p>This type of <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> may seem amusing, but to Russell it threatened the very foundations of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>.<sup>5</sup> The definition of set <i>A</i> appears to be a perfectly reasonable one, and the question of whether set <i>A</i> belongs to itself also appears perfectly reasonable. Yet it cannot be answered. Without a resolution to this <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> the basic theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> was in question.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, Russell invented a <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a logical transformation as an <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> that requires the equivalent of a quantum of time. Russell designed a set of logical operations in which a particular problem would be expressed as a "<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>" of operations to follow.<sup>6</sup> We then turn the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> on and let it run. Each logical inference or other transformation is implemented in turn, and when the process is completed, we get our answer. If we apply this theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to the problem of set <i>A</i>, the logical operations are "executed" in turn. At a certain point the answer will be yes, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> keeps running, and at a later point the answer becomes no. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> runs in an infinite loop, constantly alternating between yes and no.</p>
<p>Russell then provides narrow and broad definitions of a set. In the narrow sense, a set has a definition that allows the construction of a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that can determine whether a given <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> is a member of the set in a finite amount of time. According to this definition, set <i>A</i> (whose <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> produces an infinite loop) is not a true set, so the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> is eliminated.<sup>7</sup>
</p>
<p>In the broad sense, the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> defining the logical rules of set membership need not come to a halt in a finite amount of time, it just needs to come to <i>an</i> answer in a finite amount of time; it is allowed to change that answer as the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> continues to run. According to this definition, set <i>A</i> is a proper set. The question of whether set <i>A</i> belongs to itself will be yes at one point in "time" and no at another point, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> will alternate between the two. Thus, logical inferences are not implemented <i>instantly</i>, but rather one at a time with an orderly change of state between each. In our case, the answer is never yes and no <i>at the same time</i>. In the broad definition, set <i>A</i> is a particular type of set that is "unstable," just as an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> can be unstable. Nonetheless, the contradiction is eliminated.</p>
<p>Russell does not explicitly refer to time in his theory of types (of sets). He provides procedures for allowable transformations on propositions that can be considered <i>meaningful</i> within a logical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. This contrasts with the transformations generated by the logical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> itself, which are used to determine the truth or falsity of propositions. Thus, according to Russell, certain propositions are neither true nor false and cannot be addressed by the axioms. In our discussion above, a proposition concerning an "unstable set" would not be meaningful. The theory is interesting in that we have one set of transformations generated by the axioms of a logical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> determining truth or falsity and another set of transformations generated by the metarules of Russell's theory of types determining meaningfulness. Russell's transformations are algorithmic in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, and the issues raised are similar to certain issues in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> theory that received attention after Turing devised his <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>. Though Russell did not explicitly link the theory of types to <br>

<span class="Caption">An unstoppable proposition: Russell's <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">Paradox</a></span>
<br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> theory (otherwise, we might be referring to a Russell <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> rather than a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a> as a primary model of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>), Russell's theory of types clearly provided a foundation for Turing's later work.</p>
<p>The lecture on logic delivered by the prisoner changed the situation. He has shown quite logically why it is not possible for him to be executed following the judge's instructions. The judge then realizes that the prisoner's belief that he cannot be executed makes it possible once again to execute him. Before the prisoner can formulate another lecture on logic (that is, before the "<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>" simulating this situation can alternate again to "impossible to execute"), the judge quickly implements his sentence.</p><h2>Principia Mathematica</h2><p>Russell expanded his theory to lay a new foundation for logic and the theory of sets in his first major work in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, <i>The Principles of </i><i>Mathematics</i>, published in 1903. He subsequently felt that all of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> should be recast in terms of his new theory of sets, since the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of sets and their interactions is fundamental to all other mathematical disciplines. With the help of his friend and former tutor Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), he labored for nearly ten years to apply his new theory of sets and logic to all realms of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. Russell reported that the effort nearly exhausted him, and even late in his life he felt that this had been the most intense work of his extremely prolific career.<sup>8</sup> It was probably his most influential. As it was, Whitehead and Russell did not manage to complete their reexamination. They nonetheless published their work in three volumes in 1910, 1912, and 1913 under the title <i>Principia Mathematica</i>. The work was truly revolutionary and provided a new methodology for all <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> that was to follow.</p>
<p>As significant as <i>Principia</i> was to <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> in general, it was a pivotal development in terms of the foundations of the theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> that would be developed two decades later. Russell had created a theoretical model of a logic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, which we now recognize as similar to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, particularly in its execution of logical operations in cycles.<sup>9</sup> Indeed, Turing's subsequent theoretical model of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>, has its roots directly in Russell's theoretical logic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>.<sup>10</sup> Russell also created a <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a logical programming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that is remarkably similar in many respects to one of the most recent programming languages, <a class="thought" href="entries/prolog_entry.html">PROLOG</a>, developed originally in France and now the basis for the Japanese Fifth Generation <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> project.<sup>11</sup> <i>Principia</i> was also influential on efforts by Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and J.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Shaw to develop theorem-proving machines in the 1950s.<sup>12</sup>
</p>
<p>Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/set_theory_entry.html">set theory</a>, still based on Russell's <i>Principia</i>, provides a foundation for much of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. It is interesting to note that modern <a class="thought" href="entries/set_theory_entry.html">set theory</a> is in turn based on Russell's theoretical model of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Viewing things in this way, we could argue that <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> is a branch of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> theory. What is particularly impressive about Russell's achievement is that there were no computers even contemplated at the time he developed his theory. Russell needed to invent a theoretical model of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and programming to address a flaw in the foundation of logic itself.</p><h1>The Five Contributions of Turing</h1><blockquote>We must know, we shall know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>David Hilbert</blockquote>
<p>Turing was perhaps the pivotal figure in the development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and its underlying theory. Building on the work of Bertrand Russell and <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a>, he created his own theoretical model of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and in the process established modern <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> theory.<sup>13</sup> He was also instrumental in the development of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> computers, thus translating theory into <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. He developed specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> engines to decode the German <a class="thought" href="entries/enigma_code_entry.html">Enigma code</a>, enabling the British to withstand the Nazi air force. He was also a major champion of the possibility of emulating human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> through <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.<sup>14</sup> He wrote (with his friend David Champernowne) the first chess-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and devised the only widely accepted test of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (discussed from a variety of perspectives in several of the contributed articles at the end of chapter 2).<sup>15</sup>
</p>
<p>As a person, Turing was unconventional and extremely sensitive. He had a wide range of unusual interests ranging from the violin to morphogenesis (the differentiation of cells).<sup>16</sup> There were public reports of his homosexuality, which greatly disturbed him, and he died at the age of 41, a suspected suicide.</p><h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/enigma_code_entry.html">Enigma code</a></h2><p>By 1940 Hitler had the mainland of Europe in his grasp, and England was preparing for an anticipated invasion. The British <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> organized its best mathematicians and electrical engineers, including <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>, with the mission of cracking the German <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> code. It was recognized that with the German air force enjoying superiority in the skies, failure to accomplish this mission was likely to doom the nation. In order not to be distracted from their task, the group lived in the tranquil pastures of Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>The group was fortunate in having a working model of the German code <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> Enigma, captured by the Polish Secret Service. Working with several hints gathered by British <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>, they were able to narrow the coding possibilities, but only slightly. Under Turing's leadership, their strategy was to build an <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, use telephone relays to do an exhaustive <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> of all possible codes that the Enigma <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could produce, and apply these codes to intercepted messages. The strategy was a challenging one because an (<a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> had never been built before. They named the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>, after a popular cartoonist who drew "Rube Goldberg" machines.<sup>17</sup> The group's own Rube Goldberg succeeded brilliantly and provided the British with a transcription of nearly all significant Nazi messages.</p>
<p>The German <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> subsequently made a modification to Enigma, adding two additional coding wheels, which greatly expanded the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible codes. To meet this new challenge, Turing and his fellow cryptoanalysts set to building a substantially faster <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a>, built with two thousand <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> tubes.<sup>18</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> and nine similar machines running in parallel did their job again and provided uninterrupted decoding of vital <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to the Allied war effort.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> was regarded by the Turing team as the world's first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, although unlike Harvard's relay-based Mark I, it was not programmable. Of course, it did not need to be: it had only one job to do.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the Germans relied on Enigma throughout the war. Refinements were added, but the world's first computers built by <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> and his associates were able to keep up with the increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. Use of this vital <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> required supreme acts of discipline on the part of the British <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>. Cities that were to be bombed by Nazi aircraft were not forewarned, lest preparations arouse German suspicions that their code had been cracked. The <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> provided by the <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> machines was used only with the greatest discretion, but the cracking of Enigma was enough to enable the Royal Air Force to win the Battle of Britain.</p><h2>Hilbert's twenty-third problem and the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a></h2><p>While many in England and elsewhere remain grateful to Turing for his contributions to the war effort, his greatest legacy is considered to be the establishment of the modern theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. Yet his original goal was not the development of such a theory but rather to address one of the problems set down by his predecessor David Hilbert (1862-1943).</p>
<p>The works of Hilbert, a German mathematician born in 1862, are still widely regarded as highly influential on the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> goals of today's mathematicians. He is credited with consolidating the accomplishments of nineteenth-century <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> with such works as <i>The Foundations of</i> <i>Geometry</i>, published in 1899.<sup>19</sup> Perhaps of even greater significance, he set the agenda for twentieth-century <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> as well with a list of the twenty-three most pressing unsolved problems that he presented at the 1900 International Mathematical Conference in Paris. In his address he predicted that these problems would occupy the attention of the next century of mathematicians. Hilbert appears to have been correct. The problems have been solved slowly and each solution has been regarded as a major event. Several that remain unsolved today are regarded by many mathematicians as the most important unsolved problems in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>Hilbert's twenty-third problem is whether or not an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> exists that can determine the truth or falsity of any logical proposition in a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of logic that is powerful enough to represent the natural numbers (numbers like 0, 1, 2, . . .). The statement of this problem was perhaps the first time that the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> was formally introduced into <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>The question remained unanswered until 1937. In that year <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> presented a paper entitled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" (the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i> is the decision or halting problem).<sup>20</sup> The paper presented his <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>, a theoretical model of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, which continues to form the basis of modern computational theory.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> consists of two primary (theoretical) units: a "tape drive" and a "<a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> unit." The tape drive has a tape of infinite length on which there can be written (and subsequently read) any series of two symbols: 0 (zero) and 1 (one). The <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> unit contains a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that consists of a sequence of commands made up from the list of operations below. Each "command" consists of two specified operations, one to be followed if the last <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> read by the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> was a 0 and one if it had just read a 1. Below are the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read tape</li>
<li>Move tape left</li>
<li>Move tape right</li>
<li>Write 0 on the tape</li>
<li>Write 1 on the tape</li>
<li>Jump to another command</li>
<li>Halt</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> has persisted as our primary theoretical model of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> because of its combination of simplicity and power.<sup>21</sup> Its simplicity derives from its very short list of capabilities, listed above. As for its power, Turing was able to show that this extremely simple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can compute anything that any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> can compute, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how complex. If a problem cannot be solved by a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>, then it cannot be solved by any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (and according to the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>, not by a human being either).<sup>22</sup>
</p>
<p>An unexpected discovery that Turing reports in his paper is the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of unsolvable problems, that is, problems that are well defined with unique answers that can be shown to exist, but that we can also show can never be computed by a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>. The fact that there are problems that cannot be solved by this particular theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> may not seem particularly startling until one considers the other conclusion of Turing's paper, namely, that the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> can model any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is regarded as any process that follows fixed laws. According to Turing, if we regard the human brain as subject to natural law, then Turing's unsolvable problems cannot be solved by either <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> or human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, which leaves us with the perplexing situation of being able to define a problem, to prove that a unique answer exists, and yet know that the answer can never be known.<sup>23</sup>
</p><h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a></h2><p>One of the most interesting of the unsolvable problems, the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> problem, was discovered by Tibor Rado.<sup>24</sup> It may be stated as follows. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> has a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of states that its internal <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> can be in. This corresponds to the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of steps in its internal <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. There are a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of different 4-state Turing machines that are possible, a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 5-state machines possible, and so on. Given a positive <a class="thought" href="entries/integer_entry.html">integer</a> <i>n</i>, we construct all the Turing machines that have <i>n</i> states. The <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of such machines will always be finite. Next, we eliminate those <i>n</i>-state Turing machines that get into an infinite loop (that is, never halt). Finally, we select the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (one that halts) that writes the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 1s on its tape. The <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 1s that this <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> writes is called the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of <i>n</i>. Rado showed that there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>, that is, no <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a>, that can compute this function for all <i>n</i>s. The crux of the problem is sorting out those <i>n</i>-state Turing machines that get into infinite loops. If we <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> to generate and simulate all possible <i>n</i>-state Turing machines, this <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a> <i>itself</i> goes into an infinite loop when it attempts to simulate one of the <i>n</i>-state Turing Machines that gets into an infinite loop.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> function can be computed for some <i>n</i>s, and interestingly, it is also an unsolvable problem to separate those <i>n</i>s for which we can determine the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of <i>n</i> from those for which we cannot. Aside from its interest as an example of an unsolvable problem, the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> function is also interesting in that it can be considered to be itself an <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligent_function_entry.html">intelligent function</a>. More precisely stated, it is a function that requires increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to compute for increasing arguments. As we increase <i>n</i>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the processes needed to compute the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of <i>n</i> increases.</p>
<p>With <i>n</i> = 6, we can deal with addition, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of 6 equals 35. In other words, addition is the most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> that a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> with only 6 steps in its <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is capable of performing. A 6-state <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> is not capable, for example, of multiplication. At 7, the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">Busy Beaver</a> does learn to multiply, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of 7 equals 22,961. At 8 it can exponentiate, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 1s that our eighth <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> writes on its tape is approximately 10<sup>43</sup>. By the time we get to 10, we are dealing with a process more complex than exponentiation, and to represent the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of 10 we need an exotic notation in which we have a stack of exponents the height of which is determined by another stack of exponents, <br>

<br> the height of which is determined by another stack of exponents, and so on. For the twelfth <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> we need an even more exotic notation. It is likely that human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (in terms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of mathematical operations that can be understood) is surpassed well before the <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> gets to 100.</p>
<p>Turing showed that there are as many unsolvable problems as solvable ones, the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of each being the lowest order of <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>, the so-called countable <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a> (that is, the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of integers). Turing also showed that the problem of determining the truth or falsity of any logical proposition in an arbitrary <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of logic powerful enough to represent the natural numbers was an unsolvable problem. The answer, therefore, to Hilbert's twenty-third problem posed 37 years earlier is no; no <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> exists that can determine the truth or falsity of any logical proposition in a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of logic that is powerful enough to represent the natural numbers.</p><h2>The second and third answers to Hilbert's question</h2><p>Around the same time Alonzo Church, an American mathematician and philosopher, published Church's theorem, which examined Hilbert's question in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of arithmetic. Church independently discovered the same answer as Turing.<sup>25</sup>
</p>
<p>Also working independently, a young Czech mathematician, Kurt G&#246;del (1906-1978), sought to reexamine an issue that was not entirely settled by Whitehead and Russell's <i>Principia Mathematica</i>.<sup>26</sup> Whitehead and Russell had sought to determine axioms that could serve as the basis for all of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, but they were unable to prove conclusively that an axiomatic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can generate the natural numbers (theirs or any other) would not give rise to contradictions. It was assumed that such a proof would be found sooner or later, but G&#246;del stunned the mathematical world by proving that within such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> there inevitably exist propositions that can be neither proved nor disproved. Some have interpreted G&#246;del's theorem to imply that such uncertain propositions are simply indeterminate, neither true nor false. This misses the depth of G&#246;del's insight, however. Such propositions, according to G&#246;del, are <i>not</i> indeterminate; they are definitely either true or false. It is just that we can never determine which. Another implication is that in such axiomatic systems it is not certain that the axioms will not result in contradictions. G&#246;del's incompleteness theorem has been called the most important in all <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, and its implications are still being debated.<sup>27</sup> One of the implications is that the answer to Hilbert's twenty-third problem is again no.</p>
<p>Taken together, the work of Turing, Church, and G&#246;del, all published in the 1930s, represented the first formal proofs that there are definite limits to what logic, <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> can do. These discoveries strongly contradict Wittgenstein's statement in the <i>Tractatus</i> that "if a question can be framed, it can be answered" (6.5).</p><h2>Hope and order versus distress and perplexity</h2><p>As a final comment on Turing's, Church's and G&#246;del's perplexing insights into the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of logic, it is interesting to note the stark contrast of the mood and attitude of the intellectual and cultural life in Europe and the United States at the turn of the century in comparison with that of several decades later.<sup>28</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">Music</a> had shifted from the romantic style of Brahms (1833-1897) and the early Mahler (1860-1911) to the atonality of Schoenberg (1874-1951). <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">Art</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/poetry_entry.html">poetry</a> had made the same <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> from romantic styles to the cubism and expressionism of Picasso (1881-1973) and the minimalism of Pound (1885-1972), Eliot (1888-1965), and Williams (1883-1963). It is not unusual for changes in attitude and world view to be reflected across the arts, but it is interesting to note that the shift was reflected in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> as well. In <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, mechanics had gone from a fully refined and consistent Newtonian model to a paradoxical quantum model. The most puzzling aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> and one of its essential features, the Heisenberg <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a>, is its conclusion that there are profound limits to what human beings can know. In addition, the principle of <a class="thought" href="entries/duality_entry.html">duality</a>, which had existed previously only in metaphysical doctrine, was now firmly established in the apparently contradictory wave-<a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of light. Perhaps most disturbing, <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> itself had gone from its turn-of-the-century emphasis on comprehensive formalisms that covered all of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> to a conclusion in the mid 1930s that logic had inherent and irremovable contradictions and that problems existed that could never be solved.</p><h2>Turing's test</h2><p>Having established a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and having played a major role in the implementation of that theory, Turing's interest ran to speculation on the ultimate power of this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. He was an enthusiast for the potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and believed that it was feasible, although he appeared to have a reasonably realistic sense of how long such a development would take.</p>
<p>In a paper entitled, "Computing Machinery and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>," published in the journal <i>Mind</i> in 1950, Turing describes a means for determining whether or not a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is intelligent: the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. It should be noted that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> "passing" the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is an indication that it is intelligent. The converse of this statement does not necessarily hold. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (or <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>) unable to pass the test does not necessarily indicate a lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Some observers ascribe a high level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to certain <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of animals such as dolphins and whales, but these animals are obviously in no position to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> (they have no fingers, for one thing).</p>
<p>To date no <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has come close to passing this test. The test basically involves the ability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to <i>imitate</i> human performance. Narrower versions of the test have been proposed. For example, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chess <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> was recently able to "pass" a narrow version of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> in that observers (again, observing through terminals) were unable to distinguish its playing from that of a skilled human chess player. Another variation-one involving the ability of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to compose stanzas of <a class="thought" href="entries/poetry_entry.html">poetry</a>-is provided in "A (Kind of) <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>" in chapter 9. Computers are now beginning to imitate human performance within certain well-defined domains. As Dan Dennett said in his article at the end of chapter 2, such narrow formulations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> fall far short of the original. I discuss the prospect of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> passing the original <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> in chapter 10.</p>
<p>Turing expected that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would pass his test by the end of the century and remarked that by that time "the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> without expecting to be contradicted." Turing's prediction contrasted with other statements around the same time that were much more optimistic in terms of time frame. (In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted that by 1985 "machines will be capable of doing any work that a man can do."<sup>29</sup>) Turing was as optimistic as anyone with regard to the power of cybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.<sup>30</sup> Yet he appears not to have underestimated (at least not as much as some other observers) the difficulty of the problems that remained to be solved.</p><h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a></h2><p>In addition to finding some profound limits to the powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, Church and Turing also advanced, independently, an assertion that has become known as the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>: if a problem that can be presented to a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing machine</a> is not solvable by one, then it is also not solvable by human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Others have restated this thesis to propose an essential equivalence between what a human can think or know and what is computable. The <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> can be viewed as a restatement in somewhat more precise terms of one of Wittgenstein's primary theses in the <i>Tractatus</i>.</p>
<p>I should point out that although the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of Turing's unsolvable problems is a mathematical certainty, the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> is not a mathematical proposition at all. It is a conjecture that, in various disguises, is at the heart of some of our most profound debates in the <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> of mind.<sup>31</sup>
</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> has both a negative and a positive side. The negative side is that problems that cannot be solved through any theoretical means of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> also cannot be solved by human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Accepting this thesis means that there are questions for which answers can be shown to exist but can never be found (and to date no human has ever solved an unsolvable problem).</p>
<p>The positive side is that if humans can solve a problem or engage in some intelligent activity, then machines can ultimately be constructed to perform in the same way. This is a central thesis of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> movement. Machines can be made to perform intelligent functions; <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is not the exclusive province of human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. We can thus arrive at another possible definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> represents attempts to provide practical demonstrations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>.</p>
<p>In its strongest formulation, the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> addresses issues of <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">free will</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/free_will_entry.html">Free will</a>, which we can consider to be purposeful activity that is neither determined nor random, would appear to contradict the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>. Nonetheless, the truth of the thesis is ultimately a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of personal belief, and examples of intelligent behavior by machines are likely to influence one's belief on at least the positive side of the question.</p>
<p>The skepticism of Ada Lovelace (companion and assistant to <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a>, the nineteenth-century <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a>, a "mechanical" <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) regarding the possibility of intelligent machines was no doubt related to the limitations of computers with whirling gears and levers that he proposed to her. Today it is possible to imagine building machines whose <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> rivals the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the human brain. As our algorithms grow more sophisticated and machines at least appear to be more intelligent and more purposeful, discussions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/church_turing_thesis_entry.html">Church-Turing thesis</a> will become more practical than the highly theoretical debate in Church's and Turing's time.</p>
