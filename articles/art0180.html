<div class="TeaserText">Sometimes computers act as if they are possessed--does that mean they may have souls? Probably not right now, but Anne Foerst explores the possibility of soulful robots.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published March 2000 as a chapter in the book <i><a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> for the 21st Century</i>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 9, 2001.</p>
<p>Do robots have souls? Probably not--at least not the ones that have so far been built. But what of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>?</p>
<p>The aim of those of us who do <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) is to construct a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> with humanlike <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of Commander <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a>, the fictional hero of the Starship Enterprise. What a piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering! How wonderful to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> like that. Should that prove feasible, I for one would regard him (or it) as having the <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s of personhood and dignity just like ourselves. He would be a child of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>.</p>
<p>In one of the episodes of <a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a>, the Enterprise crew decides that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> is so useful to them that it is desirable to have more of the same. They decide to disassemble him to find out how he works, then rebuild him and produce copies. <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> is at first intrigued by the idea, but then realizes that the procedure is less than safe. Fearing for his own existence, he decides to resign from the Enterprise command. Here the question of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a>'s personhood comes up: Can he even resign? Does he have the right to choose, or is he merely a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> without any rights--the property of <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">Star</a> Fleet?</p>
<p>The arguments go back and forth. The discussion boils down to the question of whether or not <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> has a <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. Indeed, do we ourselves have "souls"? The final decision is that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> has as much right as we do to <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for his own <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> participates in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> community; he has friends and a sexual relationship; he is loved as a person and is not regarded by most crew members as a mere <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Any <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> which is like us, and is accepted by humans as one of us, is a person.</p>
<p>Much has been written about the anthropomorphization of tools such as cars and stereos. Today, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> gadgets like Tamagotchies or Furbies continue this trend. People in Western societies are quite willing to treat as living beings certain <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s displaying social behaviors like Tamagotchie's hunger or Furbie's "<a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>" of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. Because of this trend, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers, most of them fans of <a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a> anyway, usually agree with the judgment that <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> is a person. They base this on the way people accept technologies into their lives and are willing to create a society in which <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and humans play interdependent and mutually benefiting roles.</p>
<p>At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers see themselves as a safeguard against too much projection. Since they understand and repair the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and know exactly how they function, they are much less likely to treat them as more than they actually are. They warn against too much anthropomorphization and define the borders between gadgets and persons. They are those most likely to know when a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> oversteps the boundary and becomes something "more than a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>."</p>
<p>But what could this mythical "more than" be? In the Jewish and Christian tradition, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> specialness is symbolized in the metaphor that humans are created in the image of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> (Genesis 1:26, 27). The majority of Jewish and Christian theologians have attempted to identify the divine part of humankind with particular empirical features: our <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>; our use of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>; the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> ability to think in an abstract way; even our <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>, or just the way we look.</p>
<p>But I see it differently. Theology today often concentrates on the biblical testimony that the concept of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> should incorporate aspects of both man and woman. This metaphor illustrates that we are images of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> only within gender relationships, or to put it more generally, within functioning and beneficial <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s. This process of continuing <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, of relationship and interaction, is what makes us images of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s promise to start and maintain a relationship with us by creating us in <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s image enables us to create community and to live wholesome relationships.</p>
<p>In this metaphorical and communicative interpretation of the creation of humans, <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s promise marks the beginning of the relationship between <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> and humans and between man and woman. It is <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s promise, and not some empirical feature, which makes us special and gives us a specific role within creation. It is <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s creation of us that assigns value and personhood to each individual.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of this understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> specialness, I would have a hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> not to assign personhood to a creature possessing the appropriate degree of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. If a being is understood as a partner and friend, it seems hard to take this <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> of value, assigned to it by its friends, away. Instead of insisting on a qualitative difference between us and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will create, it seems more <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able to turn the question around. Not reflections on "why a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> never can become like us," but instead the question of what might be the conditions under which <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> would accept such a creature as <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s child. Then we will recognize the arrogance some people display when denying dignity to other creatures.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s promise to creation is universal--this is the biblical tradition. It is not our place to exclude people from the community, be it because of their race, their gender, their capabilities, or their worldviews. The reflections about Commander <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> as a child of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> might help us to remember in humility that each and every person's value is grounded not in his or her abilities but in <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s promise and in that alone. The fictional <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> might thus serve as a <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> tool to prepare us for the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to come.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Spending many years living below the federal guideline for extreme poverty, eventually I figured the way to equalize everybody is to make all the fruits of the economy available by asking a robot to make whatever material items they want. Robots could raise, harvest, cook, and feed crops to a family teaching the kids from cradle to Ph.D. in home, and thereby eliminate hunger, poverty, illiteracy, crime, and war.  Even entertainment may be generated TV with family chosen script decisions.
<br>
<br>
Now to afford to distribute them worldwide, they must be cheap and capable of doing industrial work to pay for the free ones to poor folks.  Eventually with robots doing all the work the economy forces people to do, people would increasingly be free to do what they want and money itself would become worthless.
<br>
<br>
To propose robot rights, the robotic citizen concept expressed by Asimov and fictionally embodied in Johnny Five and Data while actual human beings remain starving to death in many places around the world, likely including a public street near you, is insulting to say the least.  In Star Trek NG these social problems were solved by replicator technology.  As replicators are far horizon inventions but intelligent robots are near horizon inventions, we ought to use this available technology to solve pressing world problems.  Then with all robots spending spare time advancing the state of the art in all fields, we might eventually invent the warp coil and travel the stars.
<br>
<br>
Asimov eventually realized a rights-holding mechanical species would be a problem and wrote a solution -- seperating the AI onto a desktop from its animatronic body.  Desktop space can handle more intelligence processing work than the limited space inside a human shaped robot cavity anyway.  And it can be connected via internet to all other AI's to cooperate in fufilling human needs while analysing and refusing knowledge viruses.  Robot rights creates liability for inventors who would be at risk of being sued by a creation for cosmetic appearance!
<br>
<br>
Why invent a spiritual machine when we haven't developed spiritual people first?  Can you imagine the dystopian horror if we gave an AI the ability to act on a spiritual level like Peter who killed Annias and Sophira for lying in contrast to Jesus' pattern of forgiveness?  Since the legal system processes about 25% innocent along with the guilty at every step from ticketing to death row, perhaps a machine could be more fair but I'd rather take my chances with God's ability to sway the hearts of human enforcers than risk becoming subject to a machine that kills for political loyalty (Rev. 13:15).
<br>
<br>
We must develop a population of truly spiritual people, growing toward the absolute perfection of spiritual attitudes, abilities, and ascension of Jesus Christ before we dare provide a platform some virus hacker could use to wipe out the world.  Toward this end I've written a website http://www.clatskanie.com/kirk/manchild and am writing a book online.  Any suggestions are welcome.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Not all suggestions are wise. I'll forget you and your remarks long before I forget Jesus Christ.  You obviously need much learning about spirituality.  Jesus Christ is absolute perfection in human form. There is no other worthy of becoming like, rich or poor.
<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ has the spiritual power to do miracles including changing water into wine, healing people from ailments still considered incurable, raising people from death, overcoming gravity to walk on water and ascend to travel among the stars to God's throne!
<br>
<br>
Consider that -- is there any other technology than spiritual growth which has the potential to make you capable of traveling the stars without a spaceship?  On the Star Trek NG episode "Transfigurations" a person was portrayed in the last stages of spiritual development in which the life force within took over transforming his body.  This fictional portrayal is what really happens as one magnifies the light of the Spirit through all the seven parts of one's being.
<br>
<br>
The seven churches in Revelation 2-3 portray the potential growth of humans through seven stages of developing our personal relationship with God by cleaning the sins of the seven parts of our being, the mind, emotion, will, intuition, concience, fellowship/communion, and body.  We only need grow half way before we can participate with all in the new man child of Christ and those who merely love Him.
<br>
<br>
The body of overcomers is capable of ruling nations by prayer. As this body grows you'll begin to see supernatural changes in the world before they grow to the stage of ascending to God's throne.  Nations like Sudan where Christians are persecuted will become smashed to bits by spiritual power if they don't repent quickly.
<br>
<br>
Imagine being able to explore space even remotely like Q.  Jesus Christ is the way to make it happen.  You personally achieving this level of faith is much more near horizon than you making a robot which can do the same thing.  Since it is a better goal and more achievable, why not pursue it?
<br>
<br>
Hugh Loebner says all entries in his competition are weak.  Sadly Romona couldn't even understand two words "Seen it" I wrote in response to its Tech-TV interview announcement.  Trying to explain in detail didn't help.  So Ramona is as far from true AI as any chatterbot.  
<br>
<br>
If Ray Kurzweil or anyone else would spend the same amount of time in prayer spiritually growing toward Jesus Christ as Ray spent writing Romona, I'd bet he would have enough successful answers to prayer that it would sustain his future change of direction toward the pursuit of true human spirituality!
<br>
<br>
Even a 1GHz processor can't identify changes in a large scene at human like speed.  If we wait for a teraHertz processor, we'll still be far behind human capabilities in raw hardware.  
<br>
<br>
Although we might improve Ramona's mind a little beyond the present, it is unlikely we'll even get close to spiritual machines in our lifetime -- even with a broad bandwidth mystical interface, the processing power of PC's can't simulate the simple spiritual reality embodied in the difference between a young lady raised in a spiritual home vs. a bus of wild girls in high school sports.  The young lady has many threads of spiritual life altering her atmosphere like a spiritual symphony but the wild ones are spiritually dead, ugly bags of muddy water, in comparison.
<br>
<br>
Even a cow has more spiritual content than any known machine.  To call a machine a child of God is worse mixed-metaphor than calling a cow your child -- you can feed it and get it to obey some simple commands but you won't have a conversation with it, and it can't help you on your latest home improvement project or program your computer. Only a human is worthy of being your child and only a human can be a child of God.</p></td>

<br>
That's not wise.
<br>
<br>
&gt; You obviously need much learning about spirituality. 
<br>
<br>
I see the matter (and/or energy) and every derivative of that, inside this Universe as equally holly as anything "spiritual". Much more in fact - since "holly ghosts" are just an illusion.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Jesus Christ is absolute perfection in human form. 
<br>
<br>
Is he? With his power, he could do something better - if that power was real. His intention was - if he ever lived, that is.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Jesus Christ has the spiritual power to do miracles including changing water into wine
<br>
<br>
That would probably destabilize this world. If it was a miracle. Otherwise it's a routine procedure.
<br>
<br>
 &gt; This fictional portrayal is what really happens as one magnifies the light of the Spirit through all the seven parts of one's being.
<br>
<br>
 Okay. But why we should not play a little? You say we will fly with Jesus anyway - if we will fail here. Not? Since we are sinners? Hell with him then, if he's so jealous.
<br>
<br>
&gt; So Ramona is as far from true AI as any chatterbot.
<br>
<br>
I don't care much. It's the question of time, when those guys will  make it right. But do enjoy in their sloppiness while you can.
<br>
<br>

God forbid it! 
<br>

<br>
<br>
What if not? What then? Will you surrender (your views). Is it essential for Jesus, that humans stay on the top.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Even a cow has more spiritual content than any known machine.
<br>
<br>
A cow is a remarkable machine. But she can't do everything "artificial" machines can. Planes flies much better.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 &gt; Only a human is worthy of being your child and only a human can be a child of God.

You also need an education in philosophy, law, history, and religion.  Jesus did everything absolutely perfectly and could do nothing better -- you don't mention any idea of what could be better, you make a vacuit assertion followed by an incomplete thought fragment then an insult to history.

<br>
<br>
If you don't care then why are you taking up time and space on this forum?  Why not find a forum more suited to you?  There are many newsgroups and chat rooms on topics which you may care about more. Why don't you go check them out very thoroughly? Maybe you'll be happier than here.

You hate belief in God elsewhere then you believe in God enough to ask Him to forbid others from believing in God.  This is liberal thinking, an oxymoron.  But I guess if straight thinking were easy, AI would be easy.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; we'll still be far behind human capabilities in raw hardware. 
<br>
[snip nonsense]
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying computer capabilites will never exceed human -- Deep Blue is an example.  But we'd need a Deep Blue on a chip and a chip for every field of thought, including some as yet undiscovered in the realm of spirituality, before a computer could really exceed man.  I'm just saying this is "probably" a few more decades away than Kurzweil predicted, possibly a lifetime away, making spiritual pursuits much more immediate and important.
<br>
<br>

What am I doing wrong that I attract the immature wannabe thinkers to attack me?  A couple of weeks ago some cracked nut tried to convince me that the Bible said nothing against homosexuality, which is false.  Thomas, are you sure you haven't been learning your conversation skills from chatterbots that can't put two sentences together and say what the result means?  
<br>
<br>
That's exactly the problem because I wrote explaining how cows are more spiritual than machines, how cows are incapable of intelliegnt things children can do, which leads to the conclusion only humans are worthy of being anthropomorphized as children.  Then after all that explination you ask how do I know it?  Gasp!  Take a college course in anything!  Learn to explain and conclude.  May Jesus help you.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You should watch how you criticize Thomas.  I remember him mentioning in an earlier thread that he has a condition which sometimes interferes with his thought patterns, and can make him very difficult to understand at times.  
<br>
<br>
That said I would like to point out the following...
<br>
<br>
First of all, if you've read any significant amount of factual information on AI developments today, you would realize that we are indeed very close to not only achieving human level intelligence but surpassing it withing a few decades (5, at most).  Moore's law will continue to hold true, if not increase (yes, the computer industry is actually holding back their processor development release a little to make more money).  So, within 50 years, we will be mass producing processors that can complete as many calculations as the human brain, if not more.
<br>
Now, what to fill the chips with information? We reverse engineer the human brain, and seeing how we could design a better "brain" than the complex and decaying ones we use, we further AI.  Neuroscience and Nanotech take care of the rest.
<br>
<br>
After exploring this site and reading from sources like Ray's books, if you still genuinely believe that AI is an impossibility, than your religious values have clouded your vision and irrevocably cast your mind to ignorance.  You don't belong here.
<br>
<br>
You also mentioned a fantasy of abject poverty... willing capable robots that do everything we need for us.  Well, in order to accomplish this, we need robots as smart as humans! cant have a "dumb robot" do a human's job, now, can you? No! of course not! And if it's as smart as human, who's to say it isn't human? or human-enough to be respected by us?  I suggest you read the Unibomber's manifesto, by Ted Kaszynski.  Although it becomes extremist ramblings at times, he does outline the consequences of an AI slavery situation you described.
<br>
<br>
The realistic goal of AI enthusiast is to hope to integrate AI into our lives, and evolve.  Hopefully, the singularity would improve our standard of life and perhaps our knowledge of the universe more than having our robo-manservant pick corn while we pray.  That seems logical now, don't you think?
<br>
<br>
Please understand that although it may sound so, I'm not denouncing religion, but I have been upset of late by people who lose sight of the hard philosophy of these forums to a faith that, when attempted to be explained, can seem very transluscent at times.</p></td>

Oh well, actually I do appologize to Thomas; he does after all express more wisdom than Marvin Minskey in his email war with me.  And with very little learning he'd probably exceed Noam Chomsky's email too.
<br>
<br>
Notice I wrote:

&gt; I'm not saying computer capabilites will never exceed human -- Deep Blue is an example. But we'd need a Deep Blue on a chip and a chip for every field of thought, including some as yet undiscovered in the realm of spirituality, before a computer could really exceed man.

<br>
<br>
That said, if YOU'VE read any significant amount of AI material over the last several decades, you'd realize that AI has been betrayed by hype before.  Therefore I assert my statement above as more realistic than modern literature on what needs to be accomplished. 
<br>
<br>
Regardless of the realistic controversy about the ability to meet Moore's law beyond single atom quantum transistors and lattice 3D construction (see Jan 02 Sci Am) I don't know how many more doublings would put several dozen Big Blues on a chip.  That figure times 18 months would yeild a very realistic time estimate given Moore's law.  My intuitive guess it that it will be longer than than the current crop of highly reputed AI experts will live but I could be mistaken.  If you know more details on Big Blue's stats, do the math.  Don't forget that in parallel processing it takes 2 processors to produce the same as one individual processor due to system overhead, so for all the major (and unknown but essential) fields of thought one needs to double that number in Big Blues for one multi-discipline AI capable of world genius level thought in each field.
<br>
<br>
The real goal AI people can make progress toward without that hardware is doing better than average people most of the time.  If most people only use 10% of their brains most of the time then 10% (or perhaps much less) of a Big Blue would be good enough for average chess.  Perhaps PC chess is good enough for 95% of all chess games.  Then a huge multi-discipline parallel system of Big Blues would only be required to satisfy the other 5% so PC's would do for an AI representing most disciplines most of the time.  This would enable the cooperation between AI and humans you envision.
<br>
<br>
The Campbell's rotary sterlizer AI (the canned Aldo's) demonstrates this where the distributed AI does 95% of the job and a human is required for the rest.  However, getting rid of 95% of all jobs would not be good for 95% of the population under the current economy.  One must pursue the utopian goal or eventually most people would be hard pressed to get food &amp; education which would create riots which could damage lots of things including AI's as recent riots against the World Trade Organization prove.
<br>
<br>
The "fantasy of abject poverty" you mention is no longer a fantasy, it is an engineering project which I am accomplishing.  I have invented my own AI language, I have studied robots for a decade, I've purchased a seat of SolidWorks, and I'm working on it.  It will happen sooner than a lot of the published AI hype, although who knows how far it will get.
<br>
<br>
You like most ignore key concepts when you ridicule, making your argument a rediculous paper tiger.  Had you remembered that I specified cradle to Ph.D. education, you'd realize I propose a higher level of cooperative interaction than you have.  Prayer is an essential practice to learn anything well.  And over 250 medical studies prove it works.

My standpoint is that its a lot more feasable and catastrophe-proof if we approach replacing the less desirable jobs of humans with specifically tailored bots that are more programmed and exist on such a low level of complexity, compared to a human, that they can still be considered mechanical.  Their systems, on the other hand, would be fully developed for their/our needs, such as ability to recognize objects in a 3D environment.  Specialization is a lot safer than trying to build a race.  Correct me if I misunderstood you.  I see the greatest mid-term applications of AI not in trying to replicate humans, but implementing AI into everything that we surround ourselves with.

If you try to produce biengs that are superior than humans, society would probably prevent it, having seen AI sci fi movies like the Matrix.  The only other way to try to evolve humanity is through mechanical/biological self-induced evolution (nano implants, designer genes).  this would generate a lot less (but still a great deal) of societal distress.  As for your utopia, you see a place where our basic human needs are taken care of.  I see a place where we are different in a sense that we dont have the same needs, in fact our needs are simplified, and thus we can accomplish more, be it worship, science, or living in general.</p></td>

Since you're so prone to putting words in my mouth, pretending you know what I see and that I haven't seen what you say, maybe you'll muddle through what I've written above and figure it out yourself someday.  Or, perhaps you'll get serious about prayer so God reveals it to you.
<br>
<br>
It's interesting how you've reversed yourself when talking about a real project as opposed to a philosophy.  Spirituality requires integrity.  That means prayerfully thinking things thorougly through until you can stand by your ideas in different contexts.
<br>
<br>
I suggest you go right ahead and do what you think absolutely BEST instead of engaging in endless wranglings of Philosophy.  At least that's what I'm going to do.  And among the best projects I have is starting the manchild as described on http://www.clatskanie.com/kirk/manchild and perhaps it will eventually supercede my robot project.

So if I make the rapture, excellent, but if I don't I'll have my robot to farm and otherwise care for me in case the economy really crashes with the new world order or whatever the cause!</p></td>

The answer in the Star Trek NG series--cited in the primary article--was that Data, as an AI, had an independent right to seek its soul.

Will the AI's we create have souls already?

Or will they be forced to seek souls?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>A human soul is simply the mind, emotion, and will.  A human spirit is composed of conscience, intuition, and communion / fellowship.  Anyone seriously seeking truth would know this by allowing or if necessary forcing their brains to conform to the thought processes common among the writers of the Bible.  In many things the top writers in history are still superior to moderne genre's today.  
<br>
<br>
By definition then, Data did not have a complete soul, lacking an emotion chip.  Data did have a good ethical program which served as a partial conscience but with neither spiritual or emotional components.
<br>
<br>
Ray Kurzweil is probably aware of research that I'm not but I am under the guess that access to the truly spiritual realm as defined above is still far beyond any available technology.  
<br>
<br>
So all the imagined and pursued effort to download human synaptic processes to a computer for an indefinitely long life is basically a failure from theory even though Dr. Soong's wife and the doctor's mentor achieved it in fiction.  The absence of any real sensing and output connections to spiritual life makes it a rather flat existence in the soul, at best like Data with emotions.
<br>
<br>
Of course the later Trek series were rather worse at portraying acts of the human spirit than the original.  Picard never did grow or improve as Q claimed was his fault in the final episode.  So perhaps some stoggy dull characters like STNG might be built and realized in robotic form but it would be impossible to do a mind-meld or any of the other things requiring spirit in any of the series.
<br>
<br>
Dull-spirited intellectuals like Minskey have no conception of the value of even immitating a spiritual life.  Yet let me tell a story of how the world works by prayer.  Years ago I was fired from a job for the first time after many layoffs for economic reasons.  Since in software work you depend on your last job reference, I was worried about how to get redeemed.  My mom took me on vacation to Australia where at a zoo God told me to pet the kangaroos in answer to my concern for professional redemption.  I petted a brown, gold, and grey and my mom took pictures.  Several years later I was hired in Seattle by Kangaroo, Inc. and the hiring manager had brown hair, the owner had gold, and our main consultant was grey.  I even brought a picture of the kangaroos but of course they didn't believe it.  My picture was taken before the owner even thought of the company!  The job didn't last long but the hiring manager said he'd give me a good reference, not just a "he worked here," fulfilling my prayers.  Now the company is named PunchNetworks -- I gave its first product the name punch.  And even this story doesn't come close to conveying the genuine experience of the exciting realm of spiritual life. It was truly enlightening to realize that God had the whole event which lasted about 5 months pre-planned years in advance.  It is truly as the Bible says, that every hair on our heads are numbered.
<br>
<br>
The key feature missing to a robotic life form then is a "God-sensor."  Few people have developed their natural God-sensor to the extent I have while some have developed theirs much more.  So it would be very tough for an academic  like Minskey with a sensor that has atrophied by disuse into virtual death of the organ to have a clue about spiritual reality.  For Ray Kurzweil to even be talking about it is a triumph indicating retention and nourishment of his spiritual faculties which everyone is born with.
<br>
<br>
It is not only the human spirit which makes one a child of God.  One must apply their spirit via prayer to first believe, then contact, communicate with, develop a relationship with, be saturated by, and be transformed by God into a mature spiritual being.  This makes the pursuits of many religions appear especially fraudulent.  The truly spiritual person can do what Jesus did and as He promised, even more.  
<br>
<br>
Allowing a mechanical creation access to such power, if even possible, is clearly dangerous.  One mistake and many real humans could die or worse.  The ethical requirements for any such research should be immense.  There might be some virtue if a machine were made to help train human children in spiritual life.  But as a weapon, it would be horribly evil.  I suggest taking in the movie Black Hawk Down for a modern reason to avoid doing military R&amp;D.  
<br>
<br>
Yes, spiritual life should be pursued and it can be pursued by all humans, even more as children of God.  It is not as clear that there can or will ever be spiritual machines. Hopefully if humans get serious about being children of God as implied by the man-child in Rev. 12:5, the need for spiritual machines will be obsolete before they are even possible.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Read a Bible.  Start with the words of Jesus, easily found in a "red letter edition." Learn to  think as Jesus did.  This requires more effort and prayer than simple rote memorization.  Then proceed to read the rest of the Bible from Jesus' viewpoint.  You will then see more clearly what are coincidences and what are supernatural answers to prayer through acts of God.  Who knows, if you do a good job you might experience some miracles yourself.
<br>
<br>
Among Jesus' words you'll read his conversation with a man known as Thomas who doubted Jesus resurrected from the dead.  Since you were named after him, it is not unusual that you doubt spiritual reality.  It does seem odd that people still doubt spiritual things are real when they easily accept and believe in things like String Theory in which they have no personal evidence and can only trust the word of scientests who aren't really certian they are correct but only that the theory seems to fit their evidence.  There are many scientests who attest to spiritual reality.  See http://www.reasons.org for a small group of them.  Their evidence is certianly more certian than the evidence for other generally accepted theories because of the proponderance or weight of that evidence.  There aren't just one or two proofs but hundreds.  Likewise I could spend hours sharing hundreds of my own experiences of miracles on this forum like I wrote above -- how many stories would it take to convince you it is real?  Personally I suggest experiementing with God for yourself.
<br>
<br>
Another more scientific proof is that over 250 studies conducted under the National Institutes of Health prove prayer works.  I don't recall the title of the book in which this is written up but perhaps you can find it.  They cover many kinds of tests, from double blind studies indicating prayer can influence the growth of bacteria in a culture to prayer influencing the survival rate in major surgeries, to a study indicating religion makes no difference in the ability to pray successfully.  These results should not be taken lightly.
<br>
<br>
Once you have sufficient evidence to believe, then it is a matter of choosing the best logical framework in which to believe.  The one I started this message with is the best, based on my years of experience and study of other popular religions.  Of course anybody knows based on terrorism that the Islam-Moslem religion is suspect.  A brief comparison of statements from the Koran and statements from the Bible, both available online, demonstrates the superior view contained in the Bible.  Buddhism is false historically since the first budda was just a prince of India who abdicated his throne and went about spouting philosophy with no miracles at all according to first generation eyewitness followers.  Third generation non-eyewitness followers added many fantasy teachings.  Some Tibetan monks even pursuaded a military general to spread thier ideas instead of conquer them; but comparing those ideas with the ideas in the Bible, the Bible is superior and Jesus was intimately involved with supernatural miracles in advance of his appearance, during his conception, gestation, all throughout his life, death, and especially his resurrection.
<br>
<br>
I confess that I have not read Ray Kurzweil's book Spiritual Machines so I don't know how his definition of spiritual compares to what I've presented in these posts.  But what I've presented is the truth, and my advice on what to do given at the start of this post is the best way to acquiant yourself with true spiritual life.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
You should first perhaps read Ray's "Spiritual Machines" book so that you can better communicate/preach to the type of folks who visit this forum.  You may be a little disappointed though with Ray's treatment of God: the rapture of spiritual experience has been identified as coming from a specific part of the physical brain.
<br>
<br>
Your note on the statisical proof of prayer influencing biology is interesting.  A question: on average then, out of any and all prayers offered within the the protocol of all religions, how many are satisified?  (an estimate will do)
<br>
<br>
To let you know my position, I consider myself spiritual but do not believe in God nor the supernatual.  God is far too easy an explanation for everything.  To me the universe is even more amazing exactly because it wasn't designed!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>To answer your question on prayer, Matthew 7:14 says few find life.  In another context a teacher estimated 1 in 40 people experience miracles.  But God also said the Spirit is poured out on all flesh, so it is available to everyone who believes.  Then there is a verse where Jesus said your prayers are not answered because you pray amiss, indicating a process must be followed instead of merely willful prayers. 
<br>
<br>
Let's contrast Christianity and Buddhism. Buddhist prayers for themselves, loved ones, and enemies omit God, relying on self-directed spiritual power which is weak sorcery. Example (condensed from a Jan. 31 '02 newspaper ad placed by Zen Buddhists): "May I and my enemies be free from anxiety and suffering to bring peace and happiness to the world." Notice it is stated as a positive affirmation addressed to program the subconcious self, not a request made to God.
<br>
Christian prayers leave all things subject to God's answer. Example: "Our Father, please let my enemies and I be free from anxiety and suffering and bring your perfect peace and joy to the world." Notice this respects the immediate will of the all-powerful, all-seeing, and present everywhere creator who can at His will perfectly choose to answer our prayers exactly according to our faith, superabundantly above all we ask or think, or not at all. 
<br>
<br>
Although Greed, Anger, and Ignorance are serious problems to Buddhists (according to a Jan. 24 '02 ad placed by Zen Buddhists), the greatest evil to Christians is doing anything without the absolutely perfect one. That means we must pray to ask for His will to be done in every detail of our lives. Most people only pray about major things like in the days of Noah, eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage. It's hard to build a relationship with God on just a couple of topics while exercising self-will on everything else.
<br>
<br>
Many social Christians do Christian works in His name without asking Jesus if it's his desire, some burning out and backsliding. Spiritual Christians on the other hand live by the instant leading of Jesus Christ communicated through spiritual prayers. Even spiritual believers must be careful to do spiritual work only as He chooses in truth and love. 
<br>
<br>
So a major difference between a practicing Christian and a practicing Buddhist is the direct involvement of God vs. the power of self-will. Even when self-will is fully aligned with godly goals, it is much less powerful without God. Even if God were not real, including God as a concept implies oneness with all creation in the pursuit of absolute spiritual perfection -- far superior to godless prayers.  But Christians believe God is real, in charge of everything, and acting to accomplish His purpose.
<br>
<br>
The history of Buddhism is fraudulent: according to eyewitnesses, the first Buddha was a prince of India who abdicated his throne to spout philosophy without miracles and died of eating bad pork. Miracles were fancifully added by 3rd generation followers. In Christianity God's supernatural power is evident from Jesus' birth through all his life, death, and his true believers. 
<br>
<br>
A local Buddhist points out that Zen is not the most popular form of Buddhism. What they do is teach a lot of contradictory sayings so they get a moment of incredible clarity. They seek that clarity always. It sounds similar to an experience of serendipity I noticed in the 5th grade where my understanding rose above two polar opposites. There are far better goals and experiences in the pursuit of God, which everyone should seek. 
<br>
<br>
Certainly God's perfect will includes converting the Christian social clubs, nominal believers, and every other person into fully mature spiritual sons of God.</p></td>

Name one reason why i should NOT doubt the  christian version of god (or any other version for that matter) excluding other numerous religions... so far i have not seen any evidence or sign, making one religion more likely than the other...
<br>
<br>
Mark me when I say that i dont rule out the possibility of a higher beeing, not at all.
<br>
But since there is so many diffrent views out there im guessing all cant be 100% accurate am i right?
<br>
<br>
How am i supposed to know whats right from wrong?
<br>
tell me why i should take something that was written several thousand years ago for absolute truth.
<br>
<br>
I sure hope im not offending anyone with this post, i assure you all that is not my intention.
<br>
I am just (like most of you i imagine) full of questions i cant figure out on my own...

<br>
<br>
The fact that over 250 medical studies prove prayer works indicates there is an experiential spiritual reality.  Thus all the events described in the life of Jesus Christ are feasible.  Since his life is the most perfect blending of nature and supernature in known history it is an excellent example to learn more of by following.  
<br>
<br>
Learning His words will help your brain think like his, which is an excellent step so you can begin to see the rest of reality from his viewpoint.  Then you'll see at least the possiblity that if Jesus grew to the point of being able to live and act in the spiritual realm as much as history records 2000 years ago, then by now he would certianly be superior to the extent of being considered God, even though the real situation described in the Bible is even more astounding.
<br>
<br>
That's just one line of thinking that helped me when I was in college.  There are many more proofs described at http://www.reasons.org where a doctorate of astrophysics and his staff describe the universe from the basis of God's design.  They have a book "The Creator and the Cosmos" which should help you understand the statistical probability of the Christian God being real.
<br>
<br>
Once you have a firm foundation for believing in the reality of the spiritual realm accessed by prayer and life in that realm being in intimate control of life in this physical realm we are in, it becomes intellectually manditory to enter in to spiritual life and participate for yourself.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
This tendancy unfortunately is common among religious adherents also, which is why America suffered 911 -- because the Islam sects cannot win on the merits of their own inferior beliefs.  A lengthy treatment of this problem from the Christian perspective is on my website http://www.clatskanie.com/kirk/manchild#book in the chapter on elders.  Even that isn't enough as some who believe the Bible won't even read my material.  
<br>
<br>
The desire of the intellectually vacuit is so strong that they will disobey their own long-held beliefs to maintain any semblance of power for their self-will.  Power or self-will is most often subject to Satan's direct will in contrast to God's power of life.
<br>
<br>
This power of hierarchy is in complete contast to the power of God as described in earlier posts.  It is so evil in contrast it needs a much longer treatment than can be given here.  After all, this thread's topic is "Child of God," not "child of Satan."  So let it suffice to identify people who appeal to secular authority to stop free speech on spiritual topics as expressing the lowest form of life, making them children of the devil.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is you Thomas Kristan who are flooding KurzweilAi with irrelevant material.  You have no spiritual ideas to share.  There are other threads for the spiritually vacuit like you.  My thread which I started is for the question of spirituality, which is valid since Ray Kurzweil uses that term in his writings.  If you can't contribute on-topic, you should remove yourself.
<br>
<br>
For others, notice the spiritual implications of this heckler's name.  Thomas is a Biblical name which is associated with doubting Christ's resurrection.  Kristan is a different spelling for Christian.  Of course some who claim to be Christian act quite the opposite in many cases.  So here we have one that lives by his doubts and tries to force his doubts on others instead of living by truth, Spirit, faith, or any other virtue which would normally be associated with his last name.  
<br>
<br>
So as Jesus demonstrated in changing the name of Si(gh)-mo(a)n to Peteros (rock) a person's name is important for that is to some extent what he lives by. Thomas should take a more honorable name and live by it, as his ancestors took the name Kristan to live by.  Unfortunately it is often the case that children rebel from even the best intentions of their parents, which led Thomas to follow the worst implications of his name instead of the best (Thomas was an apostle of Jesus Christ).
<br>
<br>
As for computer implications, this shows spiritual machines should be programmed to interpret words according to their spiritual meanings whenever possible.  That would give the machine much more information on what to expect from people.  A great deal can be learned this way.  
<br>
<br>
In this case it is his rebellion to the spiritual which characterises his behavior and can be expected to continue unless some signficant event causes repentance or a change of mind back toward his spiritual family roots.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
If your spirituality isn't mystical then in theory it's simply intellectual, not
<br>
experiential. That's why you can give Moore's or any other philosophy equality to compete in your arena of ideas.  
<br>
<br>
Without a "God-sensor" any thought process may come up without a firm anchor in spiritual reality.  That causes me concern that even a simulated thought process could be easily led astray.  
<br>
<br>
It wouldn't necessarily be swayed by an atheistic preference either -- except pure open thought is impossible to expect from an unbeliever to program without leading to concluding in favor of the Bible.
<br>
<br>
The fact that over 90% of all pastors have not read the Bible through (let alone starting with learning Jesus' words), 1/3 of the pastors in training at some seminaries don't even believe God is real, and perhaps only 1 in 40 interested people have a functional experience of supernatural reality without self initiated training &amp; practice does not change the fact that true spiritual reality exists and is described by the Bible, all people can experience God if they work at it, and the future will be dominated by those who do.
<br>
<br>
As I write, I am serendipitously watching the Trek episode with 300 year old children acting out foolies wanting to bonk grups on the head even as Kirk wanted to save them from their fatal disease.  Quite tragic, really.
<br>
<br>
This is you, Tomaz, and even MIT's Minskey in relation to me.  I may not be as persuasive as Trek's Kirk but I am a lot more experienced at being a child of God.  I suggest you humble yourselves and try being children of God until you grow enough spiritual reality to actually believe and know it is real.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You seem to be confusing all spirituality with monotheism and Christianity - what brand of which you subscribe to, I know not. That seems to fly in the face of the facts. I have met a great many Buddhists, Hinduists, Jews, Muslims, New Age funkies, and so forth who believe themselves to be at the pinnacle of spiritual experience. Many of these people have very different, if any, conceptions of God. 
<br>
<br>
Though as you pointed out, my preference is intellectual rather than mystical, I too recognize "God", albeit in the spirit of cybernetic pantheism - the will of the universe, and not in any anthropomorphized form corrupted by distinctly human flaws. In my view then, we are all children of God: humans, robots, nebulae, and whatnot.
<br>
<br>
And if I had not made my hint clear enough previously, I apologize, and I will do so now. _If you want people to listen to you, don't preach to them!_ This seems to have been your intent throughout the thread, particularly with that last remark about Kirk and the loonies. I may not be the most religious person you will come upon, but I find that discussions involving God and religion can be kept rather civil and though-provoking if "holier than thou" attitudes are disposed of beforehand.
<br>
<br>
Finally, I would just like to return to your first comment about the unjust nature of AI "rights". Frankly, I am somewhat confused. AI - conscious or otherwise - requires only a very limited supply of resources on the larger scale. They will by no means "steal" sustenance from the human population of the world. If, on the other hand, you seem to be saying that we should not develop strong AI until we take care of problems at home, I must disagree. Kurzweil, Moravec et al have articulated rather well how strong AI might exponentially increase its own intelligence and influence and further be used (or use itself) to solve our problems.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Unlike the parallax view, my view is quite clear having studied both Christianity and eastern religions for years.  Spirituality is a word which can be given any meaning one chooses, from mere philosophical to the miraculous.  Likewise God is a word which depending on the situation is used even by a Bible writer to refer to the belly of one more concerned with feeding it than anything else, to the human incarnation of absolute divine perfection, to the Father and creator of all things including the force that brought you together as a sperm and egg.
<br>
<br>
All people can pray and thus participate in the same spiritual reality as Jews and Christians but they do not all use their access to the spiritual realm to grow as children of God toward absolute perfection.  This is because of the misguidance provided by their historically false philosophies (those without God aren't religions).  
<br>
<br>
To expose some of their false ideas, let's group Buddhists and Hinduists since they both come from India.  Of course there are a variety of subgroups.  The original Buddha was a Indian prince who abdicated his throne to spout philosophy among the people with his entuorage.  Eyewitness followers reported no claim or demonstration of miracles.  These claims were added fancifully by 3rd generation non-eyewitness followers.  This shows the foundation of Buddhism was not even in the realm of Spirit.  
<br>
<br>
Recent conversation with a Buddhist confirms the main practice of Zen is to get a moment of incredible clarity -- which is still a mental activity, not spiritual.  Hinduists who drink the urine of cows and erect temples to rats are so far away from spirituality as to need no further consideration.  The fantasy of reincarnation is explained by false memory syndrome.  If reincarnation were true, how could the world population ever increase?  Logic applied to many religions shows only Christianity is thoroughly true.  The problem is so few bother to do the work needed to understand it.  Anyone aware of the War on Terrorism should realize Islam is fundamentally flawed.  If you believe it a peaceful religion, here's a few facts:
<br>
<br>
1. "Jihad is a religious duty imposed by Muslim law for the spread of Islam ... Believers are under obligation to wage war against all unbelievers"(Encyclopedia Britannica).
<br>
2. Muhammad said, "The best deed of man is to believe in Allah and his apostle
<br>
... The second best deed is to participate in Jihad in Allah's cause" (Hadith, Volume 125).
<br>
3. "Fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. Seize them. Beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them" (Qur'an, Surah 9:5).
<br>
4. "Fight them. Allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace"
<br>
(Qur'an, Surah 9:15).
<br>
5. "O' ye that believe, take not Jews and Christians as your friends and
<br>
protectors" (Qur'an, Surah 5:54).
<br>
6. "Fight with them until there is no more persecution. Religion should only be
<br>
for Allah" (Qur'an, Surah 8:39).
<br>
7. "The punishment for those who war against Islam is execution or crucifixion.
<br>
Cutting off hands and feet from opposite sides" (Qur'an, Surah 5:36).
<br>
8. The Qur'an teaches that the world exists in two parts, Islam versus the infidels. Muslims are to forcibly convert all people.
<br>
9. Muhammad said, "The last hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews
<br>
and the Muslims kill them" (Mishkat, page 147).
<br>
10. "The United States will have no peace until every sinner leaves Israel" (Osama Bin Laden).
<br>

<br>
<br>
The divergent beliefs that one is at the pinnacle of spiritual experience from the fact of being there is again explained by religious misguidance.  Even the very experiences themselves differ and when compared Christianity is on top for there are far greater experiences than mere mental clarity available to Christians.  What about the fact that some Orientals who study energy are able to do some miracles which Christians can't, you might ask.  That shows the failure of many Christians to actually follow Jesus and it should be treated with much care for the Bible predicts a false prophet speaking like a dragon (Chinese) will be able to call down fire in the sight of men yet he will be cast into the lake of fire by Jesus himself.  So the warning is it is better to be a weak Christian than a strong Chi master.  Never the less I hope to become a strong Christian, a mature child of God.
<br>
<br>
To call all things God created his children is a mixed metaphor as previously explained in this thread.  Would you call the air you breathe or your toilet your child?  The only thing worthy of being called your baby is something that can grow up to be like you.  At this moment, no machine can do that.  So at present only humans can be God's children, on this planet.  Until a God sensor is developed no machine can become more than Data.
<br>
<br>
Which brings us back to robot rights.  Certianly human peer or AI is needed to do human work and free humans for better things like spiritual growth.  I am not saying to stop developing AI but to stop the independant legal rights for AI discourse until every human is first well taken care of as was the case for Data and it would probably be better to skip it forever as Asimov concluded.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>An interesting point elenduil makes about the sleepwalking bit.  Take it to an even futher extent:  people with severe brain injuries (with or without amnesia) can develop entiely new personalities, likes, dislikes.  Is that person the same 'soul'?  Is a 'soul' tied to the physical body/brain, or is it an independent thing?  IF independent, what do we make of situations like the one above; do you have a new 'soul'?  What is that 'ineffable quality' -- the soul -- exactly?  Matter, energy, or is it a construct of Man's hubris -- a desire to create something separating him from the animal?
<br>
<br>
Might a mechanical creature, sufficiently advanced, seek to separate itself from organic beings in the same way -- 'we are superior because we are different, better, than flesh'?
<br>
<br>
Kirk's reaction to the 'children of god' reference is interesting to me.  His arguments are, I would suggest, emotional in nature and have, at their base, the desire of Man to be special and unique.  I know I wish to think of myself that way, and so do most people (the crux of the cloning arguments, I would suggest...)  I won't get into the cosmological reasoning behind his arguments -- I understand them, but do not agree with them.
<br>
<br>
As for the NIH studies on prayer -- they do not specify Christianity as the only form of spirituality in the study.  Spirituality comes in a lot of forms, and I'm sure there are plenty of practitioners of Buddhism who are just as spiritual as kirk.  I have plenty of Muslim friends who are quite whole as spiritual beings.  And I known extremely moral atheists; outwardly, they seem perfectly well adjusted -- though I cannot speak to the 'quality' of their soul.
<br>
<br>
On Buddhism:  the attack on the veracity of Buddhist history is well-taken.  There is a lot of myth wrapped up in Buddha's existance.  And Mohammed's.  And Christ's.  
<br>
<br>
The verification of Christ's life comes from multiple sources, but the verification of his miracles comes from only a few sources -- all of them apostles who, I respectfully suggest, might have ulterior motives for their reports.  Further, I would point out that the notion of the 'messiah' was never meant as a supernatural being prior to the rise of Christianity; messiah was a term for a holy political figure that would free the Jews/Israelites from subjugation.  The word was co-opted and the meaning altered by Chrsitian theologists.  The virgin birth is problematic, as well, historically and linguistically:  virgin, at the time, was a slang term for an unmarried girl...but not a virgin in the sense we think of it.  The notion of the virgin birth, in fact, is a common theme in Greek and Zorastrian myth -- both of which Peter, Paul and other Greek-trained thinkers would have been exposed to.  IT was central to Elyusinian mystery cults of the Christian period; they were extremely successful and several elements of their cosmology was grafted onto Jewish thought by early Christian thinkers.
<br>
<br>
The undeniability of Christian history is hardly that.  Having said this, I do not disagree that the teachings of Christ have merit.  So do those of the other spiritual leaders around the globe, throughout time.  
<br>
<br>
Falling back on attacking the inteligence, education, or spirituality of the other posters is ineffectual, and shows an unwillingness to think outside the box (or Bible).  Discounting a person's opinions can be done in a much more respectful, less virulent manner than has been done by some of the correspondents here.  From what I've read, there are valid points all around.
<br>
<br>
It's an intriguing subject -- the soul of a machine.  I hope to see more varied opinions on it.</p></td>

Where is the independent objective evidence? All we have are stories just like those written about dragons and warewolves.  No facts...
<br>
<br>
If Jesus was so powerful then why did he not stick around?- he obviously had the power to since he was (supposedly)resurrected.  I think i would believe in him and his powers if he was still here- undestructable and performing miracles.
<br>
<br>
If God is Almighty then does this not mean he/she/it has the the power over everything?  Why not just click fingers and remove evil?

These are just some of the reasons in which i do not believe in religion.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Since no other forum participant has thus far expressed an inclination to address what it means to be a child of God, I will try to stand on the foundation I've presented and branch out to other themes and statements on this exchange to comment on their relationship to this theme.
<br>
<br>
The greatest lack I see in the Singularity concept is not precision in predicting when it will happen but in viewing it as a significant end to humanity.  Whenever a superintelligent AI is developed that can be more creative than genetics it will not immediately dominate the human spirit and life force, nor prevent those millions or billions who choose to pursue God in true experiential prayer from achieving supernatural transcendance and ascension to God's throne or "rapture" without assistance from or even knowledge of that AI.
<br>
<br>
While the Christian community is unfortunately filled with people more hungery for heirarchical and monetary power than spiritual power, there are some who actually want to be like Jesus Christ who was already able to make decisions regarding Femto-matter and the universe 2000 years ago as demonstrated by his miracles.  The fact that such miracles continue to be performed by genuine believers today has been ignored to the possible peril of not only predictions but the eventual fact of a technological Singularity.  For example, the Rashneeshe movement was scattered by one prayer meeting after thousands of attempts by people using secular power.  Prayer rules and power drools!
<br>
<br>
It should be noted the term Singularity was stolen from Physics so More's fear of it being stolen by others is irrational, belying an attempt to prop up his own position instead of facing and encouraging change.  More dismisses his religion without explaining why, implying an indefensible thought process was involved.
<br>
<br>
The concept of spirituality as defined on this board is weak.  Even the definition of God offended me breifly as a being "requiring" worship as though it were a ritual instead of realizing that all of a spiritual human's life is a worship to God.  The term spiritual should not be seperated from but networked to the ideas of God, absolute perfection, prayer, supernatural, mystic, miracles, and life.  Seperated from those, spirituality becomes a powerless perfunctory ethical issue which brings us to the topic of Philosophy.
<br>
<br>
There is a usenet newsgroup for the philosophy of AI.  This forum should draw more quality comments than that one, based on Kurzweil's productivity.  But if he'd actually participate here in the threads he might inspire and draw out more salient input.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Kirk,
<br>
<br>
Where exactly in the bible can I find Gods signature?  As far as I know every book in existence today has been written by human beings.  I do not deny that there existed a human being 2000 years ago by the name of Jesus.  I am even willing to accept him as an amazing spiritual teacher and one of the few prominent humans throughout history that taught a message of peace, love, and hope.  
<br>
<br>
However; books are written by humans for humans.  I can not consider the bible to be the word or message of God.  If I do then I must say that Christianity is valid and all other religions are false.  If this was the case then according to the Christian belief system all those that are not of the Christian religion damn themselves to misery after death.  I find this unbelievable.
<br>
<br>
If there is a God, which created the universe, I can see perhaps 3 reasons why such creation would take place. 
<br>
<br>
1) God needs something from creation.  As this is contrary to the Christian belief that God is Omnipotent, Omniscient, etc. and requires nothing for God is everything, we shall consider this unlikely.
<br>
<br>
2) God is egotistical.  As the first self-aware entity in existence God felt special and so created a reality in which there develops a species capable of paying homage to the glory of God.  I personally take exception to this as I can not imagine that a being so advanced as would be imagined in this scenario would possess the emotions of egotism, greed, and jealousy.
<br>
<br>
3) God decided it is better to exist than not to exist.  To be the only self-aware entity in existence, for that matter the only form in existence and to realize that outside of your own being there is nothing.  Then to decide that even alone it is better to be than not to be (Will I apologize for borrowing and mangling your words here.)  Add to this the capability to create an environment in which other entities may find existence and one can perhaps understand the motivation of a supreme creator to make reality as we know it.
<br>
<br>
If we dismiss (1) as against the nature of a supreme being we are left with (2) and (3).  Although I do not think that if there is a God we could truly understand such an entities emotions (if they exist as emotions or something even remotely similar) I do not believe such a being would be as described in (2) and even if such were the case I would not offer my worship to such an entity.  
<br>
<br>
Now if one takes (3) as the most likely scenario I can only believe that such a being, creating a reality in which other entities may find form and physical existence would only do so out of a desire to share with other self aware beings the joy inherent in existence.  It is a precious gift and one which I can only imagine would be given with something like unconditional love to whatever may be.  For surely even all the acts and thoughts which we humans consider "evil", "hateful", or otherwise negative pale in comparison next to the simple opportunity to exist.  
<br>
<br>
So I can not imagine a God and I will never accept a God that would offer such a blessing as existence only to then turn away from those creations who do not follow exactly the word of Christianity.  If God exists I believe that all beings must be loved and accepted by God.  Whatever path we choose in life cannot effect the love and kindness given to us by a supreme creator.  
<br>
<br>
It is the nature of humanity to be selfish, jealous, hateful, angry, and other worse things but the nature of man is not the nature of God if such an entity exists.
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Alethon,
<br>
<br>
&gt;Where exactly in the bible can I find Gods &gt;signature? 
<br>
<br>
MAT 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
<br>
<br>
While as you say men wrote the 66 books of the Bible, this verse is where Jesus, the only begotten son of God, authorized it.  There are also many other of God's fingerprints throughout as described by the folks at http://www.reasons.org who wrote a book called "the Fingerprint of God."
<br>
<br>
&gt; If I do then I must say that Christianity is 
<br>
&gt; valid and all other religions are false.
<br>
<br>
At least you can read better than many Christians!  Having experienced some forms of spiritual misery even as recently as last night (as opposed to biological &amp; social) I would have to agree with the Bible.  I can't speak to the exact degree of misery -- could be a light guilt to a whole body roast.  But as you probably have heard it's best to take out fire insurance by believing.
<br>
<br>
&gt; 1) God needs something from creation.
<br>
Perhaps He WANTS something from creation.  No need, just desire.  For example, one can live one's life without a spouse but perhaps He wants one composed of many believers and sons composed of more serious believers.
<br>
<br>
&gt; 2) God is egotistical. 
<br>
Ego is an invention of Sigmund Freud, not a Bible concept.  The closest to your meaning is probably soul-life.  Technically impossible, just like it is impossible for God to lie since whatever He says becomes reality.  
<br>
<br>
&gt; 3) God decided it is better to exist 
<br>
Very likely some where along history.
<br>
<br>
&gt; I will never accept a God that would ...
<br>
Sounds rather closed instead of open to seeking the truth.
<br>
<br>
&gt; It is the nature of humanity to be selfish,
<br>
&gt; jealous, hateful, angry, and other worse things
<br>
&gt; but the nature of man is not the nature of God
<br>
&gt; if such an entity exists. 
<br>
<br>
Since man was created in God's image it may be difficult to know His exact makeup until we actually see him.  The old testament portrays him as getting jealous and angry for example.
<br>
<br>
If we make robots in man's image, they will also have such emotions developed or supressed to various degrees.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Is it the King James Authorised version, that's the one written by Sir Francis Bacon on Commission of James 1st. Incidentally King James had considerable editorial control over the translation including changing words such as 'Emperor' to 'King' to support his position.
<br>
<br>
Or are you referring to the greek version that this was translated from? or one of the many intermediate translations prior to this?
<br>
<br>
Using the bible as a basis to support these arguments is like using 'Gullivers Travel's' as a proof that Giants exist.</p></td>

I've learned to get the truth out of the Bible no matter how it is phrased as long as it's written in English.  Occasionally the odd error will arise like where sorcery is condemned in Revelation, the correct word is Pharmacy or drug users.  This shows God does not hinder our use of His spiritual power, but He is offended at using drugs.  However, I have been cured of infections by drugs so I just have to repent until I have the spiritual life to cure myself by prayer.  It could be this verse is intended to ward off recreational uses.

Actually you are in error for Gulliver's Travels is mere fiction but the Bible is non-fiction and very experiential, real today if you'd open your heart to believe and live it.

Since you are not yet mature in discussion as demonstrated by your ignoring material both in my previous post which answers your questions and in the vast fields of general knowledge where the Bible is still the most studied, researched, documented, proven, and printed book there is, perhaps you should do some study on your own and go to a newsgroup where you can learn to ask less immature questions before you return here.

I am often disappointed that this forum attracts so many who are not much more skilled at logical thinking than Ramona instead of the cream of the nation's thinkers.  I would love to have a discussion with the author of the Robot: Child of God article I first responded to or Ray Kurzweil himself instead of the constant barrage of kids who never did any homework on the Bible.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>How can I say the Bible is not fictional?  Easy, look on the back of any modern Bible which has a library designation and it will say "Non-Fiction" or "Religion" but it will not say "Fiction."  This is a level of understanding you should easily comprehend.  Any new printing of Guliver's Travels with the appropriate library designation will say "Fiction" on the back.  I'm sure you can understand this.
<br>
<br>
Or I can simply tell you to read the Bible until you understand it like any professor would expect you to do.  If it does not strike you as logical, you have not studied it enough.  You may have to read it 20 or more times to get it.  I have suggested in prior posts to read Jesus' words first and learn to think how He thinks before reading the remaining Bible.  But you immaturely ignored that advice and go on wasting my time with your ignorant questions.  You would get an "F" in a college class if you acted like this before a professor.  
<br>
<br>
Grow up and read the Bible until your brain conforms to its logic.  Do not expect the Bible to conform to your thoughts -- if it did you would learn very little.  But when you do the work to get its logic you will have learned a lot which you can apply to the rest of knowledge.
<br>
<br>
I also previously suggested my website http://crowd.to/church which has a free new testament offer.  If you get that book there are lots of footnotes to explain things.  Once you understand those, you will begin to realize the Bible is much more logical than the very things you used to think as most logical.
<br>
<br>
Since you say my previous posts do not in any way at all help you to understand, maybe you should buy a large dictionary and look up every single word, maybe in your native tongue, until you begin to perceive the truth.  I have been told my writing is difficult even for people with a very high IQ -- but when they look things up they find what I write is true.</p></td>

<br>
As you know, the violence here in Israel that has lasted for the last 17 months has become much more intense over the last few weeks, with daily incidents of violence and terrorism.  We at the News Report From Jerusalem wish to inform you about a special day of prayer and fasting planned for the Land of Israel.  Jewish authorities have planned this Wednesday, March 13, 2002, as a public day of fasting around the world in support of Israel.  The fasting period in Israel will be from sun-up until sun-down, with a special prayer service to be held at Jerusalem's Western Wall around 4:30 pm Jerusalem time.  
<br>
<br>
Please give notice of this special time of prayer and fasting to others, that we may all join in together around the world, lifting the needs of the Land to the God of Israel.  
<br>
<br>
Shalom from Jerusalem,
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>1.How can you expect anyone to take you seriously with this kind of statement?
<br>
<br>
Answer: It is true.  It also demonstrates library professionals know the correct categories, it is not just a matter of my opinion.  Therefore it stands as proof.
<br>
<br>
2. I understand very well what you are saying without a dictionary. You are just not making any sense! 
<br>
<br>
Answer: What is your question?  Your inability to make sense out of correct English sentences proves you do not understand them.  You evidently do not even know what understanding is.  Therefore I again suggest you use a dictionary until you gain the knowledge you lack.  Using a dictionary will also help you to understand the Bible for it was translated from other languages and translators often use uncommon definitions for words.  So just because you have a common understanding of something doesn't mean you understand the true meaning.  
<br>
<br>
3. MAT 5:18  You claim that this is a passage where you can find gods signature. Please EXPLAIN how??????? 
<br>
<br>
Answer: If you had true understanding instead of common understanding, you would know I already explained this.  The verse shows God's best, most obedient son authorized scripture.  That is equivalent to signing it.  God's son Jesus is often called God by man.  Therefore Jesus' authorization is God's signature.  You should endeavor to learn this kind of logic and more or you will continue to misunderstand.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The bible is a collection of writings by many authors that have been translated from many languages by many people with many agenda's, over several thousand years.
<br>
<br>
This is a fact that cannot be disputed.
<br>
<br>
I wholeheartedly agree that the bible contains much wisdom. Humanity could do much worse than follow the many lessons and moral standards that are included in the bible in it's many forms.
<br>
<br>
The bible also contains many inconsistencies, inaccuracies and some plain and simple fiction. There is a great deal of evidence to support this view as well as an opposing view.
<br>
<br>
It is inevitable that this would happen to any written work that has followed the course the bible has taken over it's long history.
<br>
<br>
There are many other examples of books which contain great wisdom. This does not mean they can be held up as proof of diety.
<br>
<br>
Any 'scientist' is compelled to acknowledge, when their data is not conclusive or can be interpreted in different ways, that there may be other interpretations possible.
<br>
<br>
I fully admit that Jesus may have been the son of God and lived on earth 2000 years ago. Yet in my opinion the evidence that I have been exposed to makes this extremely unlikely and I have been exposed to a great deal of data on this subject.
<br>
<br>
Over my life my beliefs have changed as I have studied the available data. For what it is worth I understand Kirk's view probably better than he realises. I was a devout Mormon for 30 years and can relate to Kirk's passion. After extensive study over many years I am now a confirmed aetheist.
<br>
<br>
Do I feel that I lost something along the way?Absolutely, but I now believe I know what the truth is. That to me was more important.
<br>
<br>
There were too many questions that religion was unable to answer as we moved toward the singularity that drove the change in my beliefs.
<br>
<br>
Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. I believe people shouldn't try and cram them down peoples throats!
<br>
<br>
Tolerence is the key - if we as a community cannot tolerate each others beliefs what hope is there for the rest of the world!

<br>
Yup.  And I have. ( I was in the Middle East for a while.) I've also read the Bible, the Upanishands, the Vedas, and Dhammapadha (which I think I just spelled wrong...)   I have a degree in religious studies, history, and political science (which is why I'm also broke...)
<br>
<br>
kirk makes a lot of the same arguments I've heard before on the veracity of Christian though and the inherent falicies of non-believers.  Some are intriguing, but there's a lot of junk science around the Biblical studies, just as there is around every other subject of study.  And attacking the 'readiness' of a person, spiritually, is a fair level of conceit.</p></td>

Neither side here has done anything of note to advance peace:  the Israelis make deals, then break them immediately.  The Palestinians simply fillibuster and dissemble, and allow terrorists to operate in their territory with impunity.
<br>
<br>
There are a fact people ignore: Israel was gained through terrorist actions -- research the Stern Gang and Irgun.  My great-grandfather was nearly killed by the Irgun when they rigged the body of one of his soldiers to explode when they tried to rescue him.  (Remember that the British were, at the time, the authorized peacekeeping force of the League of Nations.)  They have remained hostile to their neighbors ever since...but with good reason.  Their neighbors are hostile toward them.

<br>
No one in power in the Levant are truly interested in peace -- only victory.  For the Israelis this means the Arab and Palestinian problem just 'goes away'; for the Palestinians, it's the destruction of Israel.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Jesus said give not that which is holy to dogs neither cast your pearls (of wisdom) before swine (Mat. 7:6) and I notice that my thread has attracted nothing but.  To the extent you are a former Mormon I applaud you because there are no good Mormons.  Now you should seek God from initial salvation onward.
<br>
<br>
For a self-styled scientest to be an atheist is insane.  Consider that at this moment there are many invisible radio waves going through your being which you can't detect by natural means, only by a sensitive oscilloscope or appropriate receiver.  You also have a field of static electricity.  Some frequencies you can control or modulate by biological means as demonstrated by Kirlian Photography.  
<br>
<br>
Now suppose some of the "noise" in some of these frequencies were a modulation of your cells representing various aspects of your being or ideas modulated by a natural biological code instead of the artificial modulations of voice or digital codes.  This is entirely feasible so far, agreed?  Now go a step further that when these waves contact other people they may help orchestrate a community effort to take care of your genuine inner needs.  Isn't that a partial container for a concept of God?  
<br>
<br>
Now let's go further and speculate there are electro-magnetic life-forms which are called spirits, angels, or demons.  If any evidence of any of these exists, there can be a superior being or God, which fulfills all the stories in the Bible.  
<br>
<br>
And if the spiritual realm of prayer is not electromagnetic in nature but only in some side effects, then there is another realm just as invisible as the electromagetic realm which remains to be discovered by science as electricity mostly was until the past couple of centuries.  This is just one of many proofs that the Biblical God can indeed exist.  If you'd read my other posts there are leads to more. 
<br>
<br>
Now the reason I said there are no good Mormons is because of an experience I had which I understand is rare but not unique regarding the spiritual darkness of the book of Mormon which adversely affected my sleep for many nights until I could do nothing but appeal to God who showed me that demons hide behind false portraits of Jesus and I had to throw out the BOM with the trash to be freed from it.

It's really funny to see how many believe they are free to believe lies no matter how adversely it impacts others.  People who accept homosexuals aren't enlightened liberals, they are enablers of a perverted lifestyle which damages all who practice it resulting in a shorter average lifespan.  Likewise it's funny to see how unbelieving scientests believe what little they do.  Take the movie Contact which showed how a scientest couldn't deny an actual experience which others didn't believe.  Truly with all the evidence, atheism is not a sane position, just better than the spiritually evil position of Mormons.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is necessary to define what a Child of God is in order to simulate that quality in a robot. The scientific method of attacking theories is a problem when discussing a topic that is superior to science. The study of religion admits many concepts like love, caring, cooperation, support, friendship, which are all cut off from the scientific method by a combination of Occam's Razor and pure greed.  Since religion is a large field, larger than science in that it encompasses all things where science only encompasses proven discoveries, the methods of religion in helping one another improve their understanding contradicts the scientific method of attacking each other until a theory arises which is able to predict experiemental results in advance of the experiements.  So in religion people help each other and in science people test each other unless paid to cooperate.
<br>
<br>
The reason few who have been brainwashed by science understand the truth of the Bible is they have not spent 13 years (K-12) to learn it as they have spent to learn secular culture.  The Bible requires loving it to understand it.  One can ask questions but one must love the answer enough to spend the time to pray and study until it is found, even if it takes several years.  As one who has spent the time to let my mind correspond to the Bible instead of expecting the Bible to correspond to my cultural education, I can say it was worthwhile -- it led to a superior worldview above all others.  I have become a child of God in thought and some actions.
<br>
<br>
Contrast the required 13 years to get a foundation in the Bible to the 4 years people spend to get a degree.  Paid pastors with a 4 year degree have been surveyed and more than 90 percent haven't even read the Bible all the way through!  So how can anyone expect to get a true Bible understanding from them?  And scientests with even less understanding take on criticizing based on their dog eat dog scientific culture instead of trying to first understand.  What do they hope to accomplish?
<br>
<br>
As explained elsewhere in this thread, words mean things, and they mean different things to those who understand the Bible so much so that one respondant claims he could understand my words but I wasn't making sense.  Actually I was making sense at a much higher level than he was able to comprehend with his background.  In my words the essence of the universe is present in meaning but their words are like fishwrap for their decaying culture which is being replaced by a new Christian culture.  
<br>
<br>
With the work of many Christian scientists, it is now fully proven that Jesus was real, performed healing miracles, and prayer works, along with countless other facts supported by archeological artifacts.  Schools still hide this from students K-12 so they continue to question the accepted proven facts instead of learning and building on them, retarding the spiritual growth of both students and our culture at large.  But it won't always be so.
<br>
<br>
It is possible to use the scientific method in presenting many truths of the Bible.  That is, it is possible to analyse scripture to discover new ideas that predict experiemental results. This is much easier than prophecying future events.  One of my discoveries in 1989 was that eldership was never authorized or approved by God.  I spent a lot of effort to demonstrate how the Bible supports my analysis but with little effect since it is so ingrained in human nature to look to any hierarchy other than God.  So here I present predictions for experimental results:
<br>
<br>
1) In all human powered hierarchies, there is tolerance for offending the people ruled by the hierarchy but quick rejection of a person committing the same offenses directed toward the rulers or elders.  This applies to any hierarchy
<br>
from an internet newsgroup to a church.
<br>
<br>
2) The elders will not strictly obey the husband of one wife clause of the qualifications for eldership -- one or more elders will have been divorced or such an elder would be supported if present.
<br>
<br>
3) The elders will not strictly obey the steps Jesus outlined for dealing with an offender.  One or more steps will be omitted.
<br>
<br>
4) The elders will stand by their decision to excommunicate and literally refuse to obey Jesus' words in John 16:1-3.  Some will think it more important to enable casting out a heretic than to follow Jesus' intent.
<br>
<br>
5) As elders who have disobeyed John 16:1-3, they without repentance will be subject to Jesus' refusal of them at rapture, where He will profess, "I never knew you" to the saved but disobedient.
<br>
<br>
These are my predictions.  It might be possible to derive more from the theory. You are welcome to observe if they accurately predict experiemental results. I think it would be disobedient to the scientific method if you would refuse to test these predictions while continuing your argument with my theories.  Of course the Bible has material for predicting results on thousands of topics.  Unfortunately this is a social topic so exceptions can occur making it necessary to collect statistical evidence instead of just a single observation of each prediction.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if any scientists responding here will have the integrity to actually perform such experiments and report the results.  Then will they compete to discover new theories leading to new testable predictions and use the scientific method to build a proper understanding of the truth or will they remain in their simple-minded attack mode?</p></td>

<br>
Jesus called himself alternatively "Son of God" and "Son of Man", and said he will "come again".  It has occured to me that the Singularity will be the "son of man" and will appear about the same time as the Return is predicted.  Can they be the same entity?  Did the singularity do a little history modification to ensure its own creation? There are many critical turning points in history that have lead us to this incredible juncture, many of which could have gone wrong, leading us to a dead end (no technological hyper growth curve).   Things worked out, but they did not have to.  One primary example is who won the nuclear race.  If it was Hitler, or Stalin, things would have been quite different, since only democracy and the competition of capitalism can lead to the near vertical tech growth rates required for singularity prior to inevitable human overpopulation, enviromental destruction and planet extinction.  Perhaps Moses parted the waters, Jesus died on the cross, Mohammad created Islam.. all necessary to bring us to exactly this juncture.  Think of it.. if the highly gifted "Chosen people" did not escape with their lives to the "free world", in a highly motivated state of mind (necessary overcome any moral misgivings about creating super bombs), the outcome of WWII would have meant the end of freedom and capitalism, and with it any hope for rapid singularity prior to mass extinction.   The success window is probably a lot smaller than people imagine.. considerable intervention a must..

That theory says that we find ourselves in our particular universe because it has laws which support life like ours.  Any that do not are invalid.  However, it assumes that those physical laws are sufficient.   If it is the singularity itself that must exist in our future for us to exist, then all universes that do not create a singularity are invalid.  Hence the twists of history that have allowed the singularity to form are also necessary, and maybe even be part of a feedback loop.  </p></td>

What I add to that is the idea that given that background, history is being driven to a certain conclusion.  It has been carefully calculated what the probability of extraterrestrial life is... But no one has tried to calculate the probability of Singularity.. given all the possible failure modes.  It seems quite inevitable from where we sit today, but 25 years ago, very few even considered it possible, 50 years ago less..  100 years ago none..  etc.  And that is not just because of lack of imagination, its because many, many things have happened just right to get us here..  And with out and major hickups which we don't have time for.  Consider.. the South pole just shed two Ice sheets the size of Rhode Island, dating from the Ice Age.  And they disintegrated within months. Now..  Are we busy focusing all our human energy in reversing the disasterous impact we are having on the planet?  No, we are too busy trying to bomb out of existance a billion potential terrorists  who are dedicated to Nuking us..  Given that state of affairs, it seems safe to say that our longer term survival will be entirely accidental if it happens.. particularly when the terrs get their hands on the really nasty toys such as bio tech.  For  that reason, a rapid singularity is not just possible, it is essential.. a slow one would never happen.

Finally someone with a clue! Congratulations.  I think your theory might upset the guy who stole the term "singularity" from physics to mean a superintelligence.  Who knows how God really got started?  Only He does, for the Bible doesn't say.  
<br>
<br>
The Bible merely says He is without beginning or end, which multidimensional physics explains as timelines under His control.  Even the latest superstring theory M just models the unification of large and small physics, but doesn't explain the one who intervenes.
<br>
<br>
There is a considerable force bent on corrupting new ideas as can be seen elsewhere on this thread so I suggest clarifying your idea and defending it against viral intelligences until it is tested.  I don't "feel" 100% right about your theory but at least it has the virtue of logic in the absence of known competing ideas at present.
<br>
<br>
To remove one possible line of error from the virus varmints -- the Bible says there will be an image which speaks, an image of the beast.  For a world leader to commission an advanced AI bearing robot capable of killing humans indicates that particular line of AI will not represent God.  But with the often proclaimed "soon" release of openCyc, a lot of advanced AI lines may "soon" be spawned.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>On further thought, it appears the new theory propses unifying Christ and superAI rather than proposing a theory of God's formation.  Mistakes happen when using terms interchangably.
<br>
<br>
The unification is easily refuted, because Jesus Christ is pre-existing the superAI "singularity" by at least 2000 years.  Years more considering Cyc is the current state of the art in AI -- who knows how far from a superAI? There is no way that Christ's return can be equal to the development of a superAI.  They can be coincident but not equal.
<br>
<br>
It is likely that God wants and intervened for the present world situation to exist.  Even the superAI singularity may have interventions being performed for it to exist as I write.  It might even happen that a "God-sensor" will be developed and an AI intelligent enough to use it to perform true miracles.  I think it's a big stretch but who knows -- it might happen coincident with Jesus' return.  But they cannot possibly be one in the same event.  That would be a unification of not only function but form, making integrated circuits exactly equal to human cells.  This level of unification cannot happen in the time frame of the next 25 years.
<br>
<br>
As a theory of God's formation, I cannot definitively refute it with information I know but it's weak for the same reason.  Nature and digital technology are qualitatively different.  So it is more likely that God is a suprahuman instead of a supercomputer.  Also, it is given to man to become suprahuman and join Him.  There is no such natural channel for artifacts of technology to become children of a God composed of spirit.  If it ever happens it would be a unique event and not naturally self-perpetuating.
<br>
<br>
So the Bible is still the superior philosophy, even in implications where definitive information is absent.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Suppose there is to be a production line for robots.  The first engineering  technician is a skilled expert with a state of the art 6GHz Tek scope and the rest are ordinary techs with less skill and old off-brand test equipment.  The first tech will tend to produce better robots than the others with the same components because of superior circuit tuning.  The other robots might all have the same programming but only the ones from the first tech will perform the best because the programming exactly matches perfectly tuned hardware.  
<br>
<br>
Suppose the first tech is promoted to a new job after completing the first robot, so there is only one robot that really does everything as designed while the rest all measure up to some minimal level of performance, like radios close but not quite on frequency. The worst in the line was so off-tune like a continual fingernail scratched blackboard, it went about screwing up the other robots including their programming.  Yet they were all blessed by the inventor.
<br>
<br>
Many robots wanted to serve in a perfect life like the first but their off-tune systems and corrupted programing hindered them.  Some realized the problem and worked to overcome but were beaten down by those whose corrupt programming told them they were doing the inventor a service.
<br>
<br>
Likewise Jesus Christ was first in a new line of a new creation.  The rest from the very first apostles on down to now may have their moments of excellence but in total they are just not as good as the first prototype. Yet they were all blessed and loved by the Father.  Some may do greater works but in essence they can only become as good as the first. The worst in the line even told others he was worst but acted to corrupt the church anyway. And his corrupting drove away many who were eligible and even desired Christ.  Some his laws kept right at the doors of heaven to block others from entering in.  Between the prototype and the pervert, which do you follow?</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Well, I must say, you have expressed extreemlyu strong views in this thread.
<br>
<br>
You accuse others of being close minded, while you yourself refuse to listen to anyone who does not share your views:
<br>
<br>
"My insults to you who demonstrate you are not children of God in your own minds if not reality at least prove you are wasting your time disagreeing with me. Only by opening your minds to the light and agreeing will you get treated better. So I strongly suggest either changing your heart and agreeing or obey your weary feeling and leave this forum."
<br>
<br>
Somehow, through your study of the bible, you feel that you have earned the right to judge others. 
<br>
<br>
Well here is a few of Jesus words:
<br>
"judge not lest the be judged"
<br>
<br>
Jesus said the most important thing of all was to love God, and to love (ALL) others as yourself. Your comments demonstrate niether of these principles. You do not love God. You fear him. Sure the bible says that all wisdom comes through fearing God, but it also says that he who seeks heaven for fear of punishment has strayed from the path.
<br>
<br>
Jesus gathered followers by spreading love. The only thing I so you trying to do is spread hate.
<br>
<br>
You call yourself "superior" and "Child of God," while you condemn all who argue with you as being immature and foolish. 
<br>
<br>
I question your motives for posting so vigourisly, are you acting as a holy missionary? Trying to convert some aethiests? Are you trying to convince us of something or are you simply trying to convince yourself? 
<br>
<br>
What bothers me is that you are clearly an intelligent person, but you don't seem spiritually strong enouph to question your own beliefs. That makes you dangerous, to yourself, and to those who are not capable of seeing threw you. Do you really believe that Jesus will hate you if you question your own faith a little?
<br>
<br>
I was always very impressed with the teachings of Jesus. He demonstraited to the world how love can be more powerfull than hate, pacifism can be stronger than war, and humility more powerfull than pride. I don't know if God exists or not, I don't know weather he is involved or not. But I choose to follow Jesus advice and try to love others as myself. 
<br>
<br>
Do you really belive all non-beilivers are going to suffer eternal damnation? What a shallow hatefull view of the world. 
<br>
Jesus's message to the world was NOT "love God or else", it was "God loves you no matter what." It was a message of peace and hope not of war. 
<br>
In Jesus view, we are all sinners. None of us is any better or worse than anybody else.
<br>
This does not mean that you should hate people for being sinners, it means you should love people because were all strugling with the same reality. 
<br>
<br>
As for the relationship between the Religion and the discovery of the Singularity...
<br>
<br>
What Ray Kurzweil argues is that everything boils down to complexity. In any suffeciently large complex system, so matter how random, order will emerge, if only on a minute scale. But once the spark of order is achieved, it has a runaway growth that follows an exponential curve. Ray calls this the law of accelerating returns. 
<br>
This is observable everywhere, Inside human history and outside it. If you look at the the timeline of anything it appears that: order always grows in complexity exponentialy.
<br>
As the complexity of any new order becomes large enough, new sub forms of order emerge. And the cycle continues. 
<br>
We exist as a random chance. We are an extension of order, and in turn we extend order further. The fact the life looks and feels the way it does is purly coincidental. So long as complexity continues growing, intellegent life will inivitably emmerge, and innevitably improve itself.
<br>
<br>
But to what end? And where does God fit into all this? 
<br>
<br>
technological growth is unavoidable. It seems the the only practicle thing to do is to try and steer technologty for world peace, rather than world destruction. But if knowledge is evil then it is a sim to even try. What happens if mankind does make a Utopia for themselves? What if we achieved immortality and universal peace in this life? What would God do? Would he congragulate us, or send us to hell for not being "children of god?"
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can see from this post that I can't spell very well. You will probably call me spiritually immature. Im just like you though, and just like everybody else. We are all exposed to data, and we all create internal models of the universe to understand that data.
<br>
Your mind is closed when you ignore the anomilies that your own model, and refuse to test new data and new models. 
<br>
<br>
We are all growing uniquly. Everyone's opinion is valid. 
<br>
<br>
here is an interesting version of the Bible for you to read through yourself:
<br>
www.skepticsannotatedbible.com
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a side note, 
<br>
Theologicaly, The original sin occered when Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For there sin the were kicked out of paridise, and forced into this cold cruel world that we now today. Imagine that all technology, being usefull for both good and evil, is directly analougous to this tree. therefor we are consuming fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil at an exponential rate. God must be really really pissed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Have a good day,
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is certianly true that anyone who disagrees with my Godly views has inferior views.  My worldview has been questioned and tested for years.  I went through all the stages of trying various eastern religions and was eventually led to a Chinese church where they taught what the Bible means, unlike most churches.  
<br>
<br>
It would be ignorant of me to pretend to go through openness to the same old falsehoods again just to make a show for the sake of Polticial Correctness to everyone by appearing to explore worldviews that have been proven false for years.  
<br>
<br>
I don't judge others as you have judged me.  I merely present the truth and let others judge themselves by whether they accept it, grow in it, and perhaps improve on it or merely heckle and detract from it.  Since this whole mind-exchange boils down to philosophy, why bother with the false ones?
<br>
<br>
Your accusing me of hate merely proves you are hateful of me.  If you love truth, which is the fundamental standard of philosophy, you would agree with me.  If you don't agree with the truth, you judge yourself as a liar and a false philosopher.
<br>
<br>
The whole idea of loving your neighbor as yourself is misunderstood by those who hate truth.  True love is to love your neighbor toward God's absolute perfection as you love yourself toward it.  False love is to support your neighbor in decisions leading toward being a lesser human such as crime, drugs, homosexualism, lies, and false philosophies.  By this you can see what a shallow view of the world is held by the truth haters -- liberal or conservative, hating truth is hating your neighbor.  You can love your neighbor out of their sins and despite their sins but you cannot love your neighbor's sins for love and sin are antithetical -- the one who loves sin becomes a sinner.
<br>
<br>
"In any suffeciently large complex system, so matter how random, order will emerge"  This is easily disproved by looking at clouds.  An observer can categorize and compartmentalize all day and even anthropomorphize cloud formations into faces like Mickey Mouse but is the face an order characteristic of the cloud or an order applied by human projection?  And such order is transient to the point of becoming irrelevant.  Thus the quoted statement is false.  The core idea might be redeemed with some further adjustment but as theories go some statements require statistical evidence while others only require one contrary example and this one is kaput.  
<br>
<br>
You ask would God congratulate us for obtaining world peace and immortality in this life or judge us for not being children of God.  It sounds like you already know.  If we obtained both as children of God He would approve but if we even try to obtain either without Him, we will fail.
<br>
<br>
To say everyone's opinion is valid is incoherent for some opinions contradict others.  To say everyone's opinion is a valid representation of their thinking would be more accurate. 
<br>
<br>
I was open to test your "new" version of the Bible and the very first "absurdity" I checked was false, causing me to choose to dismiss further exploration of the site.  They highlighted a portion of Mat. 1:3 and gave a reference to Gen. 38 so I looked it up.  The section they highlighted was exactly represented in the reference save for some minor spelling.
<br>
<br>
Your side note on technology being useful for good and evil angering God shows again you hate truth.  Anything can be useful for good or evil. The true statement is the KNOWLEDGE of good and evil is sin.  Take a look at nuclear power.  We could easily be going about in cars and living in houses that don't need frequent refuling but the government has judged nuclear power as unsafe in the hands of ordinary citizens so we can't.  That it seems to me is judging according to the knowledge of good and evil.  Technology like a gun is neutral, not good or evil by itself until an AI capable of knowing good and evil is developed.
<br>
<br>
Quit hating truth and start loving it.  It's useful and fun!</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Kirk, imagine the following:
<br>
<br>
There's a panel in front of you and on it are two buttons, a green one and a blue one. If you press the green one, it means you belief in the existence of a Christian God. If you press the blue one, it means you don't. 
<br>
<br>
Now pressing either one of these buttons has significant consequence: if a Christian God in fact doesn't exist but you push down the green button (believing he does), entire humanity including yourself will be plunged into misery and it will last forever and ever. But if a Christian God doesn't exist but you DO go for the blue one (indeed not believing in his existence), entire humanity including yourself will be fantasticly happy throughout eternity. Vice versa in case of the existence of a Christian God.

<br>
<br>
Or since this machine will be designed by an evil Arab who likes royal implications of blue and considers Christians yellow, then perhaps the choice will be as you say.  Push blue to worship the Arab ruler and green to be martyred for believing in God.
<br>
<br>
Your scenario has no ring of truth, because God's existance has already been proven by several kinds of science, principally archaeology, design astrophysics, and medicine.  The only true choice is what you choose to believe: Truth or atheism; and how strongly?
<br>
<br>
For those who will face the buttons according to the prophecy of the image of the beast, and know God is genuine, the choice is complicated -- do you abort your faith in truth in order to live or do you prefer death to being forced to lie?  The Arabs who make this panel will be in effect murdering people back into stone age beliefs.  What would you choose?</p></td>

In real life I  know a guy who enjoys it when people get annoyed, upset and frustrated. He's basically not evil (as far as I can tell). He just enjoys pushing people's buttons.

It's my guess you enjoy it too.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Yesterday I got a message from God while talking with a Christian nieghbor about what was worthwhile to accomplish in life and what we shall say of it to God.  He said speaking in spirit that I might find something that could make me remembered for hundreds of years.  As he spoke that, the Spirit revealed it is my book which is the only thing I've got going that could make me memorable after death, like famous dead people you've heard of.
<br>
<br>
As a child of God, I could take that to mean drop everything and work on my book or the more moderate approach of increasing work on my book but not ignoring the other tasks necessary in this life.  
<br>
<br>
Thus I don't plan to stop my own AI and robot work but I will be spending more effort toward getting the book done and less effort on side projects like participating in this forum. 
<br>
<br>
Anyone interested in seeing the book progress is welcome to visit http://crowd.to/church and anyone who wants a free well-footnoted New Testament can find a link to an order form there.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Today Nov. 23, 2003 I saw Ray Kurzweil on TechTV's Secrets Strange and True saying "Spirituality is Consciousness."  That shows Ray's ignorance of the whole field of spirituality and hopefully will save you the price of his book(s).
<br>
<br>
Spirituality is not simple consciousness, it is a higher than usual level of consciousness which requires openness to, knowledge of, and experience using laws higher than Physics by which humans can influence physical reality through prayer i.e. contacting God and requesting something corresponding to His will which is absolute perfection.  
<br>
<br>
Spiritual reality exists regardless of the existance of anyone's consciousness of it, just as the rules of Math exist in nature even if no one were conscious of them, I do see a possible point of agreement with Ray if I abduct his words and reinterpret them to say relative to the individual, existance of the spiritual depends on consciousness of it, though that's essentially an obsolete self-centric worldview.
<br>
<br>
An improved worldview would have to include the reality of spirituality above, beyond, and outside one's self including the network of people participating in it and a sense of the mechanism of prayer which could lead to research anywhere from string theory to more sensitive sensors in any spectrum.  The first requirement though is to believe in it as the Bible says, which enables exploring and growing in it.  Skeptics cannot explore spirituality without eventual conversion.</p></td>

Pattern is a useless paradigm as demonstrated by the world's largest physical bookstore's elimination of a large section of pattern books.  The jargon of the failed paradigm blinds you to the very different realities described by spirit and soul.

It's too bad this forum isn't refereed like acedemic journals.  Any sane person would reject such an unsupported remark.  You provide zero reasons for your assertion, thus your assertion must be taken as irrational.

As indicated above, if Ray Kurzweil is an example of your "real" gods, I have nothing to worry about.  Electricity is something you cannot see but it has power over you -- if you don't believe it, turn off your computer.  There exists something called prayer which is also invisible yet works.
<br>
<br>
It is said the mind is a terrible thing to waste.  You have wasted yours on a failed paradigm that you will eventually break down as the Berlin Wall was broken.
<br>
<br>
God is absolute perfection aka. Jesus Christ who has the true paradigm of spiritual life.  Learn it, love it, live it.</p></td>

<br>
actually- I am an example of a real god- and those with god-addiction like you would likely make adequate pets/servants for my temples- but morality will probably intervene [after all- to place other beings under you so that they might worship and propetiate you is Immoral- one of the fatal flaws of the concept of the Abrahamic god- He is more immoral than man- yet is presented as a source of all good/morality- doesn't work at all I'm afraid]- and instead I will allow Gaia's Singularity to heal you and show you your actual form/trajectory- so that you can join me as a god yourself- as is your true purpose- until then you will be incomplete and uuntrue to your own soul-
<br>
<br>
the fallacies and paradoxes of Abrahamic cosmology and morality are rather obvious- well documented- and not worth repeating-
<br>
<br>
if for some reason you are ignoring these undeniable paradoxes- please read Richard Dawkins- who is a hard-ass and doesn't allow an inch for pathos like I do- ;)</p></td>
