              Cyclic Universe</a> by Paul Steinhardt</i> </p>
<p>I was listening to this group talking about <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s, and it seems 
              to me there's one possibility that's so simple that people don't 
              discuss it. Certainly a question that occurs in all <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>s is, 
              "Who created the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and why? And what's it for?" 
              But something is wrong with such questions because they make extra 
              hypotheses that don't make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. When you say that X exists, you're 
              saying that X is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. It's all right to say, "this 
              glass of water exists" because that's the same as "This 
              glass is in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>." But to say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> exists 
              is silly, because it says that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is one of the things 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. So there's something wrong with questions like, 
              "What caused the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> to exist?" </p>
<p>The only way I can see to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of this is to adopt the famous 
              "many worlds theory" which says that there are many "possible 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s" and that there is nothing distinguished or unique 
              about the one that we are in&amp;#8212except that it is the one we are 
              in. In other words, there's no need to think that our world "exists"; 
              instead, think of it as like a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> game, and consider the following 
              sequence of "Theories of It":</p>
<p>(1) Imagine that somewhere there is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that simulates a 
              certain World, in which some simulated people evolve. Eventually, 
              when these become smart, one of those persons asks the others, "What 
              caused this particular World to exist, and why are we in it?" 
              But of course that World doesn't "really exist" because 
              it is only a simulation.</p>
<p>(2) Then it might occur to one of those people that, perhaps, they 
              are part of a simulation. Then that person might go on to ask, "Who 
              wrote the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> that simulates us, and who made the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> that 
              runs that <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>?"</p>
<p>(3) But then someone else could argue that, "Perhaps there 
              is no <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> at all. Only the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> needs to exist&amp;#8212because 
              once that <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a> is written, then this will determine everything 
              that will happen in that simulation. After all, once the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> have been described (along with some <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of initial 
              conditions), this will explain the entire World, including all its 
              inhabitants, and everything that will happen to them. So the only 
              real question is, what is that <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and who wrote it, and why?"</p>
<p>(4) Finally another one of those "people" observes, "No 
              one needs to write it at all! It is just one of 'all possible <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s!' 
              No one has to write it down. No one even has to think of it! So 
              long as it is 'possible in principle,' then people in that <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> 
              will think and believe that they exist!"</p>
<p>So we have to conclude that it doesn't make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to ask about 
              why this world exists. However, there still remain other good questions 
              to ask, about how this particular <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a> works. For example, we 
              know a lot about ourselves&#8212;in particular, about how we evolved&amp;#8212and 
              we can see that, for this to occur, the "program" that 
              produced us must have certain kinds of properties. For example, 
              there cannot be <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s that evolve (that is, in the Darwinian 
              way) unless there can be some <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s that can make mutated copies 
              of themselves; this means that some things must be stable enough 
              to have some persistent properties. Something like <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s that 
              last long enough, etc.</p>
<p>So this, in turn, tells us something about <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a>: a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              that has people like us must obey some conservation-like laws; otherwise 
              nothing would last long enough to support a process of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. 
              We couldn't "exist" in a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> in which things are 
              too frequently vanishing, blowing up, or being created in too many 
              places. In other words, we couldn't exist in a <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that has 
              the wrong kinds of laws. (To be sure, this leaves some disturbing 
              questions about worlds that have no laws at all. This is related 
              to what is sometimes called the Anthropic Principle." That's 
              the idea that the only worlds in which physicists can ask about 
              what created the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> are the worlds that can support such physicists.)</p>
<h3><b>The Certainty Principle</b></h3>
<p>In older times, when physicists tried to explain Quantum Theory, 
              to the public, what they call the <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a>, they'd 
              say that the world isn't the way Newton described it; instead they 
              emphasized "uncertainty"&#8212;that everything is probabilistic 
              and indeterminate. However, they rarely mentioned the fact that 
              it's really just the opposite: it is only because of quantization 
              that we can depend on anything! </p>
<p>For example, in classical Newtonian <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can't 
              be stable for long. Jerry Sussman and John <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">Wisdom</a> once simulated 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">Solar System</a>, and showed that the large outer <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s would 
              be stable for billions of years. But they did not simulate the inner 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s&#8212;so we have no assurance that our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> is stable. 
              It might be that enough of the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> of the big <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s might be 
              transferred to throw our <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> out into <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. (They did show that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a> of Pluto must be chaotic.)</p>
<p>Yes, quantum theory shows that things are uncertain: if you have 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> there's a possibility that one of its <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms 
              will suddenly tunnel out and appear in Arcturus. However, at room 
              temperature a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> is almost certain to stay in its place 
              for billions of years&amp;#8212because of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>&amp;#8212and 
              that is one of the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is possible! For quantum 
              mechanics is the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why most things don't usually jump around! 
              So this suggests that we should take the anthropic principle seriously, 
              by asking. "Which possible <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>s could have things that 
              are stable enough to support our kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>?" </p>
<p>Apparently, the first cells appeared quickly after the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> got 
              cool enough; I've heard estimate that this took less than a hundred 
              million years. But then it took another three billion years to get 
              to the kinds of cells that could evolve into <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s and plants. 
              This could only happen in possible worlds whose laws support stability. 
              It could not happen in a Newtonian <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>. So this is why the 
              world that we're in needs something like <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>&#8212;to 
              keep things in place! (I discussed this "Certainty Principle" 
              in my chapter in the book <i>Feynman and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a></i>, A.J.G. 
              Hey, editor, Perseus Books, 1999.)</p>
<h3><a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a></h3>
<p>Why don't we yet have good theories about what our minds are and 
              how they work? In my view this is because we're only now beginning 
              to have the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s that we'll need for this. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is a very 
              complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, far more advanced that today's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, yet it 
              was not until the 1950s that we began to acquire such simple ideas 
              about (for example) <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>&#8212;such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_structure_entry.html">data structure</a>s, 
              cache memories, priority interrupt <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and such representations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as "semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s." <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer science</a> 
              now has many hundreds of such <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s that were simply not available 
              before the 1960s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">Psychology</a> itself did not much develop before the twentieth century. 
              A few thinkers like <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> had good ideas about <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>, but 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> thereafter was slow; it seems to me that <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>'s suggestions 
              in the Rhetoric were about as good as those of other thinkers until 
              around 1870. Then came the era of Galton, Wundt, William James and 
              Freud&amp;#8212and we saw the first steps toward ideas about how minds 
              work. But still, in my view, there was little more <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> until 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> of the '40s, the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> of the 
              '50s and '60s, and the Cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">Psychology</a> that started to grow 
              in the '70s and 80s.</p>
<p>Why did <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> lag so far behind so many other <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s? In 
              the late 1930s a botanist named <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a> in Switzerland started 
              to observe the behavior of his children. In the next ten years of 
              watching these kids grow up, he wrote down hundreds of little theories 
              about the processes going on in their brains, and wrote about 20 
              books, all based on observing three children carefully. Although 
              some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers still nitpick about his conclusions, the general 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> seems to have held up, and many of the developments he 
              described seem to happen at about the same rate and the same ages 
              in all the cultures that have been studied. The question isn't, 
              "Was Piaget right or wrong?" but "Why wasn't there 
              someone like Piaget 2000 years ago?" What was it about all 
              previous cultures that no one <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to observe children and try 
              to figure out how they worked? It certainly was not from lack of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>: Piaget didn't need cyclotrons, but only glasses of water 
              and pieces of candy.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> lagged behind because it tried to imitate the 
              more successful <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s. For example, in the early 20th century, 
              there were many attempts to make mathematical theories about psychological 
              subjects&#8212;notably <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. But there's 
              a problem with <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. It works well for <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a>, I think because

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a fascinating article! Isn't anyone else going to comment on it? (In this universe, I mean)
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
FROM THE ARTICLE:&gt;Imagine that somewhere there is a computer that simulates a certain World, in which some simulated people evolve. Eventually, when these become smart, one of those persons asks the others, "What caused this particular World to exist, and why are we in it?" But of course that World doesn't "really exist" because it is only a simulation.&lt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
In his famous G.E.D., Douglas Hofstadter spoke about the possibility of a world created in, say, a fictional story, *existing* somewhere. Well, not existing, but having characters that discuss their existence. Any comments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt;So we have to conclude that it doesn't make sense to ask about why this world exists.&lt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
It seems that we are at about the 2 year old stage of human evolution. Two year olds ask why about everything, even when it doesn't make sense. For example: 
&lt;br&gt;
(mother) "Do you want milk or juice"? 
&lt;br&gt;
(child) "Why"? 
&lt;br&gt;
(mother's thoughts) "?? Why what??"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilarious Marv,
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
but I dont think you will turn godists around before they wear you out!
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Psychology IS as mathematical as physics, providing you allow it to modify it's laws like physics is allowed.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
But the gamme is about cross-disciplines.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I ran a psychology lab for a while, and notocesd as astonishing thing.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The really great psycholgists generated different theories about how the mind was workiing ON A WEEKLY BASIS!.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
You can argue of course that part of intelligence is being able to generate predictions and models.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The scientists then tests them.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Science is an external discipline based on empirical experimental work.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
These people were getting cues that others couldn't who were using blueprint mnodels, and they hadn't got f-in models.those changed weekly.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
What seemed to matter was contact and a real desire to help the client.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
But looking at the universe is a great way, and it sure fits all the requirements of a computing system, with a few unknowns like blackholes thrown in.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Many World Theory is an attractive theory, I've spent 15 years and it's illusive as hell to me.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
One great difficulty is getting your head round the continum of self-consciousness ie I FEEL that i can now decide and coose which path I will follow, but MWT returns  even quantum theory to the determined world.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question about the universes existence is very rational.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Thinking about god(s) or thinking about what caused the universe is simply a question beyond human answering depending on you know and have access to and the length you exist, so what we do is we MAKE UP A PLACEHOLDER ANSWER, that has ELEMENTS of logic and elements of intuition but is a partial fabrication, it is a rough (course) idea or placeholder model until further data becomes available.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
We do this in science if you look at history, many scientists because they did not have the tools speculated!  This is what I call "arbitrary modelling"
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I believe that ignorance and the reviled "magical thinking" is a necessary stage of intellectual development.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Our ability to arbitrarily model any data (imagine things that don't exist) is why we are such powerful survivors to begin with, people like to mock religion and god but the truth of the matter is, it represents a kind of trans-rationality, being able to step outside what is known (think about it in terms of set theory, being able to exist out side the set and sit on the fence).
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
You can see this in the Intelligent Design vs Natural evolution debate on the internet.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Any reasonably intelligent person who's ever seen a flagella can most certainly see that PALEY's hypothesis that life was precision machines was CORRECT and that darwins hypothesis was also CORRECT (descent with modification).
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
But the truth is we don't really grasp (and even understand) why we exist as conscious entities, our consciousness while dependent on a "reductionist" kind of scientific functionalism, also appears to have qualities of existing outside of functionality (i.e. a computer simply processing enormous amounts of data, suddenly forming an ego and then being able to direct and decide WHAT DATA to process next.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
We have the ability to choose between one path or another or to focus our processing power towards an end like we were pushing buttons in the master control room of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love reading Minsky's thoughts on this. Actually, it had occurred to me that we are undergoing the same process of evolution described by Piaget. I had a friend who studied Piaget several years ago, and he made me aware of this.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 However, Minsky has proposed nothing that has not already been written biblically centuries ago. Asking who created the universe is a useless question. The problem is to keep human minds from creating universal models that expand and eliminate adaptive capacities.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 From  Genesis to Revelation, the main theme that escapes religion is that "knowledge of god" cannot be contained within human conceptions. If it were, then we could simply devise the rules that promise god-like behavior, which we have failed to do. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 Even biblically we are repeatedly told that humans do not have the knopwledge of god or of a creator, yet we still assume that it can be demonstrated, and failing demonstration, we can assume that the knowledge of god can be contained within a cllective framework of rules that direct organizations.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 If such knopwledge does not exist, then no amount of rules, laws, or size can produce an authentic understanding. Romans 8:7 sums it up.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 But Minsky does attack the right issues. If such questions are futile, what do we ask?
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 We are limited to the universe itself, or to the probable universes that exist to produce such beings as ourselves.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 But having such beings as ourselves means that there is no sense in searching for a universe in which "who created it" can be answered. Any such universe would supply answers to our own universe, making another universe unnecessary.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 Minsky points out that trying to ask questions petrtaining to something outside our universe must be included within the universe. The very act of defining it will include it within the causal processes of this universe.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 To me this implies that the search for a creator is futile even within a multiverse, which further suggests no reason to propose a multiverse theory in the first place, since each truth we discover of existence pertaining to any universe would also apply within this universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
