<p style="font-weight: bold"><a class="thought" href="entries/prolog_entry.html">Prolog</a>ue </p>
<p>We are&#8212;all of us&#8212;freaks of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. We don&#8217;t generally 
              see ourselves this way, of course. After all, being <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, what 
              could be more ordinary than a human being? But it turns out that 
              our personal (and biased) impressions that we are unremarkable simply 
              don&#8217;t stand up against the plain, <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive facts. The way 
              we walk, for example, teetering on long, paired stilts of articulated 
              bone, is unique among <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s, and as preposterous in its way as 
              elephant trunks and platypus feet. We also communicate by tossing 
              oddly intricate noises at one another, which somehow carry complex 
              packages of feeling, <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. We share and understand 
              these sounds as if they were scents drifting on the wind, and our 
              minds special noses that sniff the fragrance of their meaning. Using 
              them we are able to change one another&#8217;s minds, even bring 
              one another to tears. We also invent, to the point of being dangerous, 
              incessantly bending the things, living and otherwise, around us 
              to our own ends. Because of this habit, we have, for better or worse, 
              created national economies, erected the pyramids of Giza and Chich&#233;n 
              Itz&#225;, fashioned exquisite <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, sculpture, and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, invented 
              the steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>, moon rockets, the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, stealth bombers, 
              and &#8220;weaponized&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. Nothing on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> seems 
              to escape our urge to remake it. These days we are even tailoring 
              genes to remake ourselves. </p>
<p> This book is about how we became the strange creatures we are, 
              and why we do these peculiarly human things. It wonders what makes 
              us cry, why we fall in <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, invent, deceive, laugh uproariously 
              with close friends, and kiss the ones we care about. It asks what 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary twists and turns <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> events that made the 
              symphonies of Mozart, the insights and art of Leonardo, the drama, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/poetry_entry.html">poetry</a> of Shakespeare possible, not to mention bad soap 
              operas, Hollywood movies, and London musicals. It speculates on 
              why chimpanzees, despite sharing so much of our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, do not reflect 
              upon the meaning of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, or if they do, why they haven&#8217;t 
              so far shared their insights. In the end it wonders how you became 
              you and how our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> became, of all the species it could have 
              become, the thoroughly unprecedented one it is. 
            <p> Human beings are insatiably curious, especially when it comes 
              to the subject of ourselves. This is not a new insight. Philosophers, 
              poets, theologians, and scientists from <a class="thought" href="entries/plato_entry.html">Plato</a> to Darwin, St. Augustine 
              to Freud have already penned volumes about our humanness that bow 
              endless rows of the sturdiest library shelves. You might ask, if 
              these thinkers have fallen gasping to the mat trying to wrestle 
              these questions into submission, why this book should have any better 
              luck. The simple answer is that today we have far more solid information 
              to work with. 
            <p> During the past decade enormous strides have been made in two 
              broad scientific fields: <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurobiology_entry.html">neurobiology</a>. Advances in 
              genetics are helping us gain insights into the way all living things 
              evolve and develop. Each of us has come to exist in the unique form 
              we do because of the combinations of genes that our parents passed 
              along. You are, to a large degree, the person you are because of 
              the messages these genes sent, and continue to send, to the ten 
              thousand trillion cells that have assembled just so to form you. 
              Hardly a day goes by without some news about a remarkable discovery 
              that further illuminates the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of the DNA that 
              makes life possible. 
            <p> The other field is <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. Being a human being (as opposed 
              to a wasp or a fruit fly), all of your behaviors and <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s are 
              not dictated by your genes alone. Your brain holds many of the secrets 
              that make humans human. Genes may be outrageously complicated, but 
              the human brain makes our genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> look like the crayon drawings 
              of a four-year-old. Though it weighs a mere three pounds, it consists 
              of a hundred billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, each of which is connected in a thousand 
              different ways to the other neurons around it. This means that every 
              waking moment your brain is linked along a hundred trillion separate 
              paths, trafficking in thought and insight, processing great streams 
              of sensory input, running the complex plumbing of your body, generating 
              (but not always resolving) all of your colliding and conflicting 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, conscious and unconscious. These connections, by one estimate, 
              make your possible states of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> during the course of your life 
              greater than all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Given 
              the immensity of this <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, you are never likely to think all 
              of the thoughts you are actually capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, nor feel every 
              possible feeling. Nevertheless, each shining day we give it a try. 
            <p> Over the past decade scientists have been developing ways to scan 
              and reveal in increasingly refined detail how our brains are constructed 
              and operate. They are far from resolving its mysteries, but we know 
              much more today about its behavior than we did even a short <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              ago. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning and FMRI (Functional 
              Magnetic Resonance Imaging) are revealing &#8220;movies&#8221; of 
              our thoughts, or more precisely the flow of chemicals in the brain 
              as we think and feel. Today we have a far better understanding of 
              how <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, laughter, and thought play themselves out in the brain 
              than we did as recently as the turn of the twenty-first century. 
              Right now the resolution of these movies is cellular, but they will 
              soon reveal the brain at a molecular level, making the reading of 
              minds much more than a parlor trick. 
            <p> Scientists also keep nibbling away at the mysterious edges of 
              paleoanthropology, <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a>, sociology, and computer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, to mention only a handful, shedding <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> by bit on 
              the special brand of behaviors we call human. In other words, we 
              remain largely unknown to ourselves, but we are making impressive

              . . </span>
<p> How did we become human beings? All living things are unique. 
              The forces that drive evolution make them so, honing each down to 
              the razor edge of itself, providing it with a handful of qualities 
              that distinguish it as the only <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> of its kind. The elephant 
              has its trunk. Bombardier beetles manufacture and precisely shoot 
              boiling hot toxic chemicals from their tails. Peregrine falcons 
              have wings that propel them unerringly through the air at seventy 
              miles an hour to their catch. These traits define these creatures 
              and determine the way they act. But what unique traits shape and 
              define us? I have whittled it down to six, each unique to our kind: 
              our big toes, our thumbs, our uniquely shaped pharynx and throat, 
              laughter, tears, and kissing. How, you may ask, can something as 
              common as a big toe, as silly as laughter, or as obvious as a thumb, 
              possibly have anything to do with our ability to invent writing, 
              express joy, fall in love, or bring forth the <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> of ancestral 
              China? What could they have to say about rockets and radio, symphonies, 
              computer chips, tragedy, or the spellbinding art of the Sistine 
              Chapel? Just this. 
            <p> The origin of all these human accomplishments can be traced to 
              these traits, each of which marks a fork in the evolutionary road 
              where we went one way and the rest of the animal kingdom went the 
              other, opening small passageways on the peculiar geography of the 
              human heart and mind, marking trailheads that lead to the tangled 
              outback of what makes us tick. Take the knobby big toes we find 
              at the ends of our feet. If they hadn&#8217;t begun to straighten 
              and strengthen more than five million years ago our ancestors would 
              never have been able to stand upright, and their front feet would 
              never have been freed to become hands. And if our hands had not 
              been freed we would not have evolved the opposed and specialized 
              thumbs we have, which made the first tools possible. 
            <p> Both our toes and thumbs are linked to the third trait&#8212;our 
              unusual throats and the uniquely shaped pharynx inside, which enables 
              us to make more precise sounds than any animal. Standing up straightened 
              and elongated our throats so that our voice box dropped. In time 
              that made speech possible, but we also needed a brain that could 
              generate the complex mental constructions that language and speech 
              demand. Because toolmaking required a brain that could manipulate 
              objects, it supplied the neural foundations for <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a>, and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/grammar_entry.html">grammar</a> so that eventually it could not only take objects and arrange 
              them in an orderly manner, it also could conceive ideas for our 
              pharynx to transform into the sound <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>s we call words and organize 
              them so they made <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> as well. 
            <p> A mind capable of language is also a self-aware mind. <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">Consciousness</a> 
              melded our old primal drives with our newly evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              in entirely unexpected ways that even language couldn&#8217;t successfully 
              articulate. This explains the origins of laughter, kissing, and 
              crying. Though we can glimpse their origins in the hoots, calls, 
              and ancient behaviors of our primate cousins, no other species carries 
              these particular arrows in the quivers they use to communicate. 
            <p align="center"><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold">. 
              . . </span>
<p>Some may argue that we cannot possibly be reduced to six of anything. 
              And some may argue that these traits are not unique to us. Kangaroos 
              stand upright, after all. And dogs whimper and whine. And don&#8217;t 
              chimpanzees pucker and smack their lips? Yes, but kangaroos hop, 
              they don&#8217;t stride; dogs do not cry tears of sorrow or joy 
              or pride. In fact, they don&#8217;t cry any tears at all. No other 
              animal does, not even elephants, contrary to some apocryphal stories. 
              And while chimps can be trained to kiss, they do not naturally climb, 
              during their adolescence, into the backseats of Chevrolets, or anything 
              else for that <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, to neck. 
            <p> The larger point is that the extraordinary abilities and behaviors 
              that define us&#8212;for better or worse&#8212;as a species come 
              from somewhere, and if we keep asking, &#8220;where, how, why ... 
              &#8221; enough, we arrive at their roots. The investigation of one 
              illuminates the other, and together, in the peculiar arithmetic 
              of evolution, they eventually add up to the strange, astonishing, 
              and perplexing creatures we are. Maybe the point isn&#8217;t so 
              much to pin ourselves beneath the unforgiving glass of a microscope 
              to arrive at definitive and irrefutable answers. We are far too 
              complex a race to be reduced to the sum of so many split hairs. 
              Maybe the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant thing is to simply keep asking interesting questions 
              and follow where the answers take us. As it turns out, they take 
              us to some remarkable and fascinating places.

              thoughts the way we do because our hands once learned to shape sticks, 
              stones, and animal skins into tools. Nouns became the equivalents 
              of objects, verbs represented actions, and we (or our hands) took 
              on the role of a sentence&#8217;s subject. </span></p>
<p>To ancestors like Handy Man, the physical grammar of cracking open 
              a femur to eat the marrow inside might have gone something like, 
              &#8220;Hit bone (with) stone.&#8221; He might not have had any words&#8212;any 
              mental symbols&#8212;to attach to these objects or actions, but 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of using one thing to affect another would have been 
              part of his physical <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. There was no way around it. If 
              you pick up a stone to strike a bone, certain actions must unfold 
              in a certain sequence for the whole business to work out. The brain 
              must consciously conceive and act on that sequence, or the bone 
              and stone will forever sit there, and never the twain shall meet. 
              And any ape that spends his day gazing at a rock and bone, doing 
              nothing, will never eat an ounce of marrow, and certainly won&#8217;t 
              live long enough to pass his genes along. Animals like these, as 
              scientists like to say, &#8220;get selected out.&#8221; </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px"><span style="color:#221E1F">The unavoidable conclusion here is that toolmaking not only resulted in tools, 
              but also in the reconfiguration of our brains so they comprehended 
              the world on the same terms as our toolmaking hands interacted with 
              it. The physical <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> our marionette fingers were having 
              with the objects around us was shaping the way our brain organized 
              and thought about everything. The hand speaks to the brain as surely 
              as the brain speaks to the hand.</span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Perpetua'; font-size:7.8pt; color:#221E1F"><sup> </sup></span><span style="color:#221E1F">Art, or at least craft, was beginning to imitate life, and the rudiments of language 
              and complex human thought were sprouting from the sense-able, concrete 
              sequences of that life. </span></p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 15px"><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold">. 
              . . </span></p>
<p> <span style="color:#221E1F">In 1</span><span style="color:#221E1F">996, Vittorio Gallese, Giacomo Rizzolatti, and their colleagues at the University 
              of Parma in Italy inadvertently discovered the strange and mysterious 
              ways in which evolution works. They were recording signals transmitted 
              from neurons in an area of the brains of macaque monkeys called 
              the F5 region. This is a specific sector of the frontal lobes that 
              sits among a larger area of the brain that deals with making and 
              anticipating movements called, fittingly, the premotor cortex.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">The scientific team already knew that F5 neurons fired when monkeys performed 
              specific goal-oriented tasks with their hands or mouths&#8212;picking 
              up a peanut and then holding it, for example. But for this series 
              of tests they wanted to see if the F5 neurons acted any differently 
              when the objects themselves were different. Did it matter, they 
              wondered, if a monkey was picking up a peanut rather than a slice 
              of apple? </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">It was while they were performing this routine <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> that they noticed something 
              odd. When a macaque watched a researcher&#8217;s hand pick up an 
              object and bring it close to his mouth, the sensors connected to 
              the monkey&#8217;s brain indicated that neurons in its F5 region 
              were firing. They didn&#8217;t activate when the monkeys simply 
              saw the objects sitting there, only&#8212;and this was what was 
              so unusual&#8212;when the monkey watched researchers pick them up, 
              or when the monkeys themselves picked them up. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">The implications of this are enormous. If the same neurons were firing in the 
              monkeys&#8217; brains when they watched the action, it meant they 
              were playing out what they were seeing before them inside their 
              own brain&#8212; their mind&#8217;s eye&#8212;just as if they were 
              doing it themselves. They were mentally &#8220;mirroring&#8221; 
              the physical action. You could also say that in a rudimentary way 
              they were imagining they were </span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Perpetua'; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">doing </span><span style="color:#221E1F">the action; reliving, neuron by firing neuron, the experiences of others&#8212;in 
              effect, putting themselves in the shoes of the researchers they 
              were watching. They were experiencing a form of empathy that itself 
              required a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">The ignition of F5 neurons made these seemingly simple gestures and maneuvers 
              a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> far more powerful than any hoot, grunt, 
              or howl. After all, if the monkey was mentally picturing the actions 
              of the researcher, it was also quite possibly remembering and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              it. Monkey see, monkey do. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">If you look hard, you can catch glimpses of early conscious communication on 
              all sides of this. Imagine two habiline creatures&#8212;a parent 
              and a child&#8212;sitting in their small, lakeside camp two million 
              years ago, smoke billowing from the enormous volcanoes at their 
              backs. They have roughly twice the neuronal <a class="thought" href="entries/wetware_entry.html">wetware</a> of the average 
              chimp today (and certainly more than a macaque monkey), so their 
              intelligence is far from trivial. On the other hand, they still 
              can&#8217;t speak, so their ability to share what is on their minds 
              is limited, even though they undoubtedly have far more to communicate 
              than any of the other animals around them. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">Now imagine the parent is making a simple tool, like those that Nicholas Toth 
              and his colleagues experimented with. The child watches intently. 
              Simply by observing, the same neurons&#8212;her mirror neurons&#8212;are 
              firing in her head that are firing in her parent&#8217;s. And so 
              when she attempts to repeat the action she has been watching, she 
              can call upon those fired neurons to guide her hands to do something 
              she has never actually done before but </span><span style="font-family:'serif', 'Perpetua'; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">has </span><span style="color:#221E1F">imagined doing. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">For his part, when the parent strikes flint against the rock, he is silently 
              talking to the watching child. He is saying, with his hands, &#8220;This 
              is how you make this thing. You hold this large rock like this and 
              strike it with this small rock just so.&#8221; You can see him holding 
              up the sharp sliver of flint that the blow has created. &#8220;See, 
              now you have a knife.&#8221; And then next, he may carve the skin 
              off a carcass, taking the &#8220;conversation&#8221; in a new direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">The entire time the child is &#8220;listening.&#8221; Neither parent nor daughter 
              have any language; not a single word they can exchange, not even 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of words, only the looks on their faces, the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s 
              in their eyes, the gestures they make with their hands as they manipulate 
              and exchange the rocks and flint. But a lot of information is traveling 
              back and forth between their two minds. In a very real sense they 
              are conversing. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">This apparent connection between conversation and manipulation is more than metaphorical. 
              More recent research, built on Gallese&#8217;s and Rizzolatti&#8217;s 
              original discovery, has revealed that the F5 region in macaque monkeys 
              is an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> for areas in our own brain essential for generating 
              human language and speech (not necessarily the same thing, as we 
              shall see). We know this partly because a few years after the discovery 
              of mirror neurons, Rizzolatti and another researcher, Scott Grafton, 
              found that when humans watch someone handle objects, a region of 
              the brain called the superior temporal sulcus, which sits directly 
              behind the left temple, activates and mirrors what they see. This 
              surprised scientists because they had long thought that this part 
              of the brain existed primarily to send the signals to Broca&#8217;s 
              area that generate speech. Now it appeared Broca&#8217;s area was 
              handling other jobs as well, or deeper ones. It not only sent signals 
              to the muscles that generated speech, it sent the signals to hands 
              and arms that enabled the precise manipulation of objects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#221E1F">Rizzolatti thinks this fusion of objects and imagination, gestures and words 
              provides a glimpse into the genesis of language. Mirror neurons 
              might be the primal wetware that enabled our ancestors to transform 
              the common ground of doing and making into the earliest forms of 
              conscious communication. F5, or something like it, might very well 
              have been the bud from which Broca&#8217;s area&#8212;a cornerstone 
              of human language&#8212;blossomed.</span></p>

<p style="font-style: italic">The Insights of Dr. Broca </p>
<p>How we actually generate language is a mystery, but we know that 
                we can&#8217;t do it if a part of the brain known as Broca&#8217;s 
                area, named for the brilliant French doctor and anatomist Pierre 
                Paul Broca, who discovered it, doesn&#8217;t function properly. 
                Broca first located this part of the brain when he performed an 
                autopsy in 1861 on a patient, known as Tan, who had died from 
                gangrene. The man was known as Tan because when he tried to speak 
                all he seemed capa<span style="color:#000000"></span><span style="color:#000000">ble of saying again and again was the word &#8220;tan.&#8221; This affliction 
                be</span><span style="color:#000000"></span><span style="color:#000000">came known as Broca&#8217;s aphasia, and the autopsy revealed that there had 
                been damage to specific sections of the inferior frontal gyrus 
                in the left frontal lobe of the brain (roughly near the left temple). 
                Subsequent studies Broca and others performed confirmed that in 
                most people (left-handers usually being the exception) this is 
                the area of the brain that somehow takes the symbols our minds 
                create when we want to communicate, attaches sounds to them, and 
                then coordinates sending the signals to all of the muscles needed 
                to make the precise sounds we call speech (or in the case of those 
                who can&#8217;t speak, make the hand signals needed to communicate). 
                </span> </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">Brain scan</a>ning <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has confirmed Broca&#8217;s findings. 
                These areas of the brain &#8220;light up&#8221; when we generate 
                speech. Broca&#8217;s area is connected to Wernicke&#8217;s area 
                by a neural pathway called the arcuate fasciculus, and using these 
                two sectors of the brain, we handle most of the generation and 
                understanding of the spoken (or signed) word. Because Broca&#8217;s 
                area is so closely located next to areas of the brain associated 
                with mirror neurons and those sectors that control both facial 
                muscles and hand coordination, it may help explain how toolmaking, 
                gestures, and speech are connected. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Foreword</span></p>
<p><strong>by Ray Kurzweil</strong> </p>
<p> The late Stephen Jay Gould wrote that &#8220;the most important 
              scientific revolutions all include, as their only common feature, 
              the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another 
              of previous convictions about our centrality in the cosmos.&#8221; 
              For example, a few centuries ago we thought that all the celestial 
              bodies revolved around the Earth, only to discover that we live 
              on a small planet revolving around a humble star on a remote wing 
              of a routine galaxy. Not so long ago, we thought that we had descended 
              from the gods, only to discover that we had actually descended from 
              primates, and before that worms. Gould, Richard Dawkins, and others 
              point out that evolution works by chance, and if we were to rerun 
              evolution, we would probably look very different, or not have evolved 
              at all. 
            <p> All of this is true, but it misses the point. We are central after 
              all. Let me explain why. 
            <p> We live in a universe that is capable of embodying information 
              in atomic and molecular structures. Why this is the case is itself 
              an interesting question. How did it come to be that the laws of 
              physics and several dozen constants embodied in those laws are so 
              precisely what they need to be to allow structures such as atoms 
              and molecules to exist? One interpretation of what has become known 
              as the &#8220;anthropic principle&#8221; basically says that if 
              we didn&#8217;t live in such a universe, we wouldn&#8217;t be here 
              talking about it. Another school of thought not inconsistent with 
              the anthropic principle&#8212;one that I&#8217;ve written about&#8212;is 
              that our universe evolved these rules through a series of universes. 
            <p> Be that as it may, we are fortunate that the laws of physics do 
              allow atoms and molecules to exist, because a large chaotic system 
              filled with such information-rich structures is the perfect stage 
              for an evolutionary process to take place. This has allowed evolution 
              to create structures that over time have become ever more complex, 
              more knowledgeable, more intelligent, more creative, and more beautiful. 
            <p> If we examine evolution in more detail, we can consider its past 
              and future to comprise six grand epochs, where each epoch is characterized 
              by the mechanism for storing information. The first epoch, which 
              we can call the &#8220;epoch of physics and chemistry,&#8221; embodied 
              information in atomic and chemical structures. Particularly notable 
              in this regard has been the carbon atom. As a result of its proclivity 
              to make connections with other atoms in four different directions, 
              it is especially good at encoding information. 
            <p> Ultimately, increasingly complex biochemicals evolved into DNA, 
              a molecule that can directly encode digital data as little software 
              programs called genes. With DNA, evolution had an information processing 
              backbone to keep track of and to guide its experiments. Thus the 
              second epoch, the &#8220;epoch of biology,&#8221; encoded information 
              in rungs of DNA. Biological machines at the nanoscale, such as the 
              ribosome, turn this DNA data into three-dimensional proteins, which 
              self-assemble into organisms. 
            <p>As the organisms fought (and in some cases, cooperated with) each 
              other, they evolved to become ever more complex. Ultimately, brains 
              evolved, initiating the third epoch, what I call the &#8220;epoch 
              of brains,&#8221; with information now encoded in neural patterns 
              of neurotransmitters and ion channels. 
            <p> When brains evolved to reach a certain level of complexity and 
              capability, and related features of bodies also evolved, the technology-creating 
              species evolved (actually there were a few such species, but only 
              one survives today). This represented the fourth epoch, with information 
              now stored in hardware, and ultimately software designs. 
            <p> The fifth epoch, which we are now initiating, is when the technologycreating 
              species (that&#8217;s us) uses its technology to understand (that 
              is, to reverse-engineer) its own biology, including the methods 
              of its brains, and incorporates the design ideas borrowed from biology 
              into its own technology. 
            <p> To explain the sixth epoch requires insight into the exponential 
              nature of an evolutionary process. Evolution works through indirection: 
              it creates a capability and then incorporates that capability when 
              it evolves subsequent stages. For this reason, the process accelerates, 
              and the products of the evolutionary process grow exponentially 
              in capability. 
            <p> For example, it took a billion years for DNA to evolve, but then 
              biology used DNA in all of its subsequent stages. The next stage, 
              the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals evolved, 
              progressed a hundred times faster, taking only about ten million 
              years. The process continued to accelerate, and our species evolved 
              in only a few hundred thousand years. The first stages of technology&#8212;fire, 
              stone tools, the wheel&#8212;were faster yet, taking only tens of 
              thousands of years. We have consistently used the latest generation 
              of technology to create the next. So today, paradigm shifts in technology 
              take only a few years. Think back to the time most people did not 
              use search engines. That sounds like ancient history, but that was 
              less than a decade ago. 
            <p> The exponential growth of the capability of technology represents 
              a formidable pace of advancement. The computer in your fifty-dollar 
              cell phone today is a thousand times more powerful than all of the 
              computation shared by all of the students and professors at MIT 
              when I was a student there in the late 1960s. That represents a 
              billion-fold increase in price-performance, but it will pale compared 
              to what we will see in the future. We are now doubling the price-performance 
              of computation and communication every year. And even that rate 
              is increasing over time, so we will see another billion-fold increase 
              in only twenty-five years. During that same period, we will complete 
              the reverse-engineering of the human brain, as that undertaking 
              is also proceeding at an exponential pace. Already, two dozen regions 
              of the human brain, including portions of the auditory cortex, visual 
              cortex, and cerebellum (where we do our skill formation), have been 
              modeled and simulated on a computer. And a simulation of the all-important 
              cerebral cortex is also already under way. 
            <p> This exponential progression will lead us to saturate the ability 
              to support sublimely intelligent computational processes here on 
              Earth within a century. We will then expand out to the rest of the 
              universe to keep the exponential progression of this evolutionary 
              process going. This expansion beyond the Earth will represent the 
              sixth epoch, which I call &#8220;the universe waking up.&#8221; 
              The sixth epoch involves vastly expanded human intelligence (predominantly 
              nonbiological) spreading outward from the Earth ultimately at the 
              fastest physical speed possible. We understand this limit to be 
              the speed of light but there are hints that there may be shortcuts 
              in the form of wormholes. 
            <p> So in a nutshell, that&#8217;s the story of evolution past, present, 
              and future. And the key step in this story is a recursive (self-repeating) 
              one. The pivotal point came when a species (Homo sapiens) evolved 
              that was actually capable of initiating an entirely new evolutionary 
              process&#8212;technology. Like biological evolution, technological 
              evolution has seen a progression of increasingly complex and subtle 
              forms, but at a pace that is a thousand times faster. That pace, 
              in fact, is continuing to accelerate and will ultimately be millions 
              of times faster, leaving biology in the dust. 
            <p> So how did this come to be? That is what Chip Walter&#8217;s brilliant 
              book explains. It is an important story, not just from the viewpoint 
              of understanding who we are, but from the perspective of the six 
              epochs; it is the story of the tipping point of evolution. 
            <p> Even if you believe that we are not alone in the universe and 
              that there are many other intelligent technology-creating civilizations 
              beyond the Earth (there are actually good reasons to doubt that, 
              which I won&#8217;t go into here), some comparable enabling factors 
              would have undoubtedly occurred in the evolution of these extraterrestrial 
              species. The details would be somewhat different, but the key factors 
              are likely to be similar. 
            <p> So what were these enabling factors? As Chip explains in the book, 
              the highlights are that we evolved a larger skull to incorporate 
              a larger brain (at the expense of a weaker jaw, so don&#8217;t get 
              into a biting contest with another primate). More of that brain 
              was devoted to the cerebral (prefrontal) cortex, so we gained the 
              ability to do recursive thinking. We became capable of assigning 
              a symbol to a complicated set of ideas and then using that symbol 
              in yet more elaborate structures of ideas. This enabled us to devise 
              complicated procedures for creating tools, and to handle the recursive 
              structures in language. 
            <p> And of course we have that all-important opposable appendage (the 
              thumb) that enabled us to take the &#8220;what if &#8221; experiments 
              in our minds and actually try them out. We were able to imagine 
              tying a stone to a stick and then actually build the tool. One might 
              point out that a chimpanzee&#8217;s hand looks similar to ours. 
              But the devil is in the details, and a chimp&#8217;s hand is just 
              not designed well enough to fashion tools. Some people maintain 
              that chimpanzees are also a tool-making species, and, yes, a chimp 
              can grab a stick and poke it into the ground, but its ability to 
              do this is too clumsy to enable a sustainable process of technology 
              improvement. The pivot points in a chimp&#8217;s hands are not in 
              the right place for a power grip or for fine motor coordination. 
              Homo sapiens, on the other hand, were capable of carefully winding 
              the twine around the stone and the stick to create a useful tool, 
              and then using that tool to create the next generation of tools. 
            <p> Chip points out that our hands would not have evolved as they 
              did if we had to continue to use our front limbs for walking. Moreover, 
              if we had continued to walk on all fours, our hands would not have 
              been free to build tools. So the evolution of our big toes and other 
              anatomical details of our feet was also critical to this tipping 
              point in evolution. 
            <p> As this book points out, laughing and crying are more subtle but 
              nonetheless equally important developments in the human story. Aside 
              from making life a lot more interesting, they have played a fundamental 
              role in our cultural and technological evolution by being key enablers 
              of social bonding. The brains and hands of a single human are not 
              sufficient to create the grand enterprise of technology. Building 
              the railroads and the communication networks that humanity has assembled 
              has also required a great deal of social organization. Laughing 
              and crying represent key attributes of our ability to put ourselves 
              in another&#8217;s place, which was crucial in building our social 
              institutions from families to nations. And let&#8217;s not forget 
              kissing, another unique human attribute that contributes to the 
              social order. 
            <p> There are neural correlates of our social bonding, such as the 
              mirror neurons, which, as the name suggests, enable us to see ourselves 
              through the eyes of others. Recently, we have discovered a set of 
              uniquely complex neurons called spindle cells, which appear to enable 
              our higher emotions. Certain primates such as apes also have spindle 
              cells, although not as many as humans, and recently we have found 
              that whales have them as well. 
            <p> There is a lot more to this story, and Thumbs, Toes, and Tears 
              is the first book that I am aware of that tells it in a comprehensive&#8212;and 
              highly entertaining&#8212;way. One could argue that it is the most 
              important story in the history of the universe. 
            <p> It was bound to happen sooner or later that a species would evolve 
              somewhere in the universe that would combine the ability to do recursive 
              thinking with the ability to manipulate and change its environment. 
              Whether or not this threshold has been reached somewhere else in 
              the universe, we do know that it has occurred here on Earth. As 
              a result, we are the only species (that we know about) that has 
              an exponentially expanding knowledge base that we pass down from 
              generation to generation. We are the only species capable of going 
              beyond its biological limitations through its own designs. We are 
              the only species that has changed its environment and even its own 
              design. We didn&#8217;t stay on the ground. We didn&#8217;t stay 
              on the planet. And we have not stayed within our biological limitations. 
              A thousand years ago, human life expectancy was just twenty-five 
              years. It was thirty-seven in 1800, and is pushing eighty today. 
              This increase will soon go into high gear as the information technologies 
              to modify biology go into high gear. And along with radical life 
              extension will also come radical life expansion, as we merge with 
              the increasingly powerful and refined technology that we are creating. 
            <p> And, so, we are unique after all.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Does the advent of Memes allow us to talk about "species level will?" In other words: Dawkins emphasises that in biological evolution, selection happens at the gene level and not the group or species level; genes are selfish. Memes are also selfish, but memes can be shared between many invdividuals. Thus, does it make sense to say that selection is happening on the species level? Or is that an inapproprite mixing of levels?

Stated yet another way: does it make sense to look at cultures and subcultures as organisms presently?</p></td>

<br>
...efforts to stabilize can actually make instability more severe in the long run,
<br>
when some efforts are misapplied.
<br>
...discretion in practice, runs a risk of exacerbating hazards
<br>
and encourages some to take excessive amounts of risk.
<br>
...a credible way to limit expectations of a future is to incur the risk of short-run disruptions to some by
<br>
disappointing expectations for others and by not being as free as before.
<br>
...do not self-protect and thus leave yourself more susceptible.
<br>
...opacity of a system makes it more difficult for some to distinguish fundamental adjustments from simple
<br>
panic.
<br>
...it hardly seems fair to level the playing field
<br>
when fairness is not a goal.
<br>
Overcoming Blows
<br>
I believe the difference between memory and imagination could be very small sometimes.
<br>
They may very well borrow from the other and blur together so much they become inseparable. The leap to
<br>
denying one or the other is a loss I rather not make. I'll hold on for as long as I can, as long as it takes, if it's
<br>
not forever, then it won't matter as much.
<br>
while it seems a long way to the top,
<br>
it's just a short drop to the bottom
<br>
except maybe in freefall,
<br>
if one only imagined how easy sainthood
<br>
is attained.
<br>
a price so small, you'll no doubt wonder
<br>
what the catch is.
<br>
you'll remember anything too good to be true,
<br>
isn't.
<br>
so the sinner skates.
<br>
thinking restraints are too uncomfortable,
<br>
not necessary.
<br>
nagging is such a thankless task.
<br>
and habits so hard to break.</p></td>
