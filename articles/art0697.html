<p>The vision I portrayed in <em><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a></em> in 1986 
              inspired a generation of students to direct their careers toward 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. Perhaps because it explores consequences of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> 
              and broad principles, rather than tracking then-current technologies 
              and trends, <em><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>s </em>continues to sell briskly as a book 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to understand where nanotechnology is today 
              without understanding how we got here. Today's <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              and opinion bears the imprint of ideas in <em>Engines of Creation</em>, 
              in part directly, but in large part through reactions, misconceptions, 
              reactions to misconceptions, and the peculiar dance of <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a>, 
              technologies, and funding that followed. I'd like to offer a sketch 
              of this process as it looked from my perspective, then a brief view 
              looking forward. </p>
<h3>A Sketch of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a>, 1986-2006</h3>
<p><em>Engines of Creation</em> envisioned a new landscape of future 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies, and within a few years of its publication many 
              regarded the term "nanotechnology" as synonymous with 
              the highest of high technologies. Many researchers were already 
              studying the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and technology of nanoscale things (large <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, 
              thin coatings, advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, small <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, thin fibers, 
              etc.) and they found that interest in their work multiplied when 
              they described it as "nanotechnology". Partly through 
              relabeling, partly though new initiatives, research in nanotechnologies 
              became more coherent and grew explosively. Conferences sprang up, 
              and companies, and <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s. Old fields found fresh vigor, 
              and new capabilities multiplied. In 2001, the U.S. launched a multi-billion 
              dollar National Nanotechnology Initiative (the NNI), and parallel 
              efforts emerged across Europe and Asia, where nanotechnologies were 
              at a similar level. The new nanotechnology establishment in government 
              and industry projected a trillion dollar market within ten years. 
              Critics reacted, warning that nanotechnology was opening a "Pandora's 
              box".</p>
<p>From a distance, it seemed that the vision presented in <em>Engines 
              of Creation</em> had broadened and grown, inspiring leaders to direct 
              vast resources toward a revolution in manufacturing, toward developing 
              nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry, guided by <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, that would join molecular 
              building blocks to make products with atomic precision and unprecedented 
              capabilities. A closer look showed a different <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>: In the U.S., 
              at least, molecular manufacturing became a taboo subject for a decade. 
              The cause was a reaction to a public misconception that had gotten 
              its start from a misreading of <em>Engines</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Engines of Creation</em>, I pictured molecular manufacturing 
              using "replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s" to build things, including 
              more machines like themselves. I explained why sensibly designed 
              machines of this sort would use and require specially prepared materials 
              and be "useful but harmless". Further study showed that 
              this approach would be needlessly complex and inefficient. There 
              is simply no need to build tiny self-replicating machines. In a 
              detailed, technical book, I described and analyzed desktop-scale 
              molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that would be far simpler and more 
              efficient. (If you like math-intensive books, I recommend it: <em>Nanosystems: 
              Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a></em>, Wiley/Interscience, 
              1992). But meanwhile, the earlier ideas from <em>Engines</em> had 
              spread into popular culture&#8212;science fiction, movies, and <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a>s&#8212;and 
              taken on a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of their own. The ideas that spread fastest simplified, 
              transmogrified, and sensationalized. Soon, "nanotechnology" 
              was all about making so-called "nanobots"&#8212;self-replicating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a>-like things that could work miracles, but would inevitably run 
              amok, eat the world, and turn it into "gray goo." And 
              these monster nanobugs were, of course, said to be my idea.</p>
<p>How did the spread of these fantasies affect policy within U.S. 
              government circles? Not well. Not well at all. The new nanotechnologists, 
              working with particles, coatings, and the like, couldn't deliver 
              the promise of nanotechnology as understood by the public, and they 
              certainly weren't about to unleash swarms of ravenous nanobugs. 
              Quite naturally, they didn't like the popularized version of advanced 
              nanotechnology, especially in its absurd, mutant forms, and they 
              blamed me. From where they sat, "it" (that Drexler stuff) 
              was a single blob of inflammatory ideas. The popular culture images 
              were genuinely full of nonsense, and when they responded with a 
              simple message&#8212;that "it" was all nonsense&#8212;they had some 
              success in getting rid of false expectations and fears. This convenient 
              idea became a consensus among the funders and elders of the burgeoning 
              nanotechnology community.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that the founding organizers of the United 
              States National Nanotechnology Initiative took care to invite not 
              one speaker, spend not one dime, have not one word on their website 
              that might suggest that the idea molecular manufacturing should 
              even be considered. Indeed, as you can see from the exchange reprinted 
              in Appendix <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, a leading establishment spokesman, Nobel Laureate 
              Richard Smalley, denounced the idea. He insisted that molecular 
              manufacturing was all about making things called "nanobots"&#8212;self-replicating, 
              monstrous, bug-like things that would inevitably run amok. He of 
              course said that they were my idea. And impossible.</p>
<p>My 2003 exchange with Prof. Smalley marked a milestone on the return 
              to realism. Before it appeared in print, the establishment said 
              that he had refuted the molecular physics of molecular manufacturing. 
              After, it became plain that he had refuted only absurd ideas from 
              the popular press, and had nothing persuasive to say about the actual 
              technical <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s. Vocal rejection fell out of fashion and young 
              researchers found a new <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> to speak of ambitious <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ives.</p>
<p>A second milestone came in 2006: an independent, high-level, scientifically 
              grounded report on the subject. Congress had directed the National 
              Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to review the 
              performance of the NNI. A committee including experts in physics, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, and engineering met, invited and questioned experts on 
              molecular manufacturing, and subjected the concepts and analysis 
              in <em>Nanosystems</em> to careful, technical review. They examined 
              current understanding of atomistic control, error rates, speed of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>, thermodynamic efficiency, and so on, and note that these 
              "can be calculated in theory, but not predicted with confidence." 
              The report closes with a call for funding "experimental demonstrations 
              that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision."</p>
<p>Finally, after 20 years, a competent committee had examined the 
              evidence, considered the science, and offered an informed judgment.</p>
<p>During these years, despite U.S.-centered confusion, a tide of 
              nanotechnologies has continued to rise. There have been many results: 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/microelectronics_entry.html">Microelectronics</a> became nanoelectronics. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> power has grown 
              10,000 fold, enabling ever larger and more accurate design and modeling 
              of molecular systems. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> molecular machines have been studied 
              and harnessed; simple artificial molecular machines have been designed 
              and synthesized; advanced molecular machines have been designed 
              and simulated. Designing and making new <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s developed from 
              an idea to a task that can be completed in weeks. <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> strands have 
              been designed that fold and link to form million-<a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, three-dimensional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s that can be designed and made in a single workday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Soviet Union fell, Europe expanded, China awoke, 
              and the US stood as the unchallenged <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> power, while a few 
              decades-old spacecraft continued their endless fall into interstellar 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Revolutionary advances in space continued to await a revolution 
              in spacecraft fabrication. Revolutionary advances in machine <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              continued to await new ideas. As for social intelligence, institutions 
              that aid factual judgment (on climate change, molecular manufacturing, 
              etc.) lagged far behind mass <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> that treat dispute as a sport. 
              Computers, once rare (<em>Engines</em> began with a typewriter and 
              was delivered on paper) multiplied and linked through <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s to 
              form a new world of worlds. A <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> publishing system&#8212;the World 
              Wide Web&#8212;emerged, growing explosively in size and abilities, reshaping 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. But they continued to lack what <em>Engines</em> describes 
              as crucial: readers of a controversial document can't easily see 
              the best-rated criticisms, and so critics can't respond where it 
              would <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> most. And so the Web presents <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and nonsense 
              almost as equals, and amplifies both. At both the surface and depths 
              of the computational world, there's a need for new structures. 
            <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> in nanotechnologies has created many powerful capabilities, 
              and I think that the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is ripe to combine them to move molecular 
              engineering to a new level. DNA engineering builds precise, million-atom 
              frameworks; engineered proteins can bind to precise locations on 
              these frameworks; and proteins can bind other <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s&#8212;strong 
              and stiff, electrically or chemically active&#8212;and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> shows that 
              proteins themselves can serve as construction machinery.<br>
<br>
              Taken together, these developments have opened the door to a new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of engineering, and through it to a path that leads, step 
              by useful step, to advanced molecular manufacturing.</p>
<p>Technical studies indicate that nanofactories, ranging to desktop 
              scale and larger, will be able to convert simple chemical feedstocks 
              into large, atomically precise products cleanly, inexpensively, 
              and with moderate <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> consumption. They indicate that a 10 kilogram 
              factory will be able to produce 10 kilograms of products in hours 
              or less&#8212;a stack of billion-processor laptops, a package containing 
              a trillion <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-sized medical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, or a roll containing hundreds 
              of square meters of tough, flexible stuff that converts sunlight 
              to electric power. It seems that raw materials will be the main 
              cost of production. At a dollar per kilogram (a typical price for 
              industrial feedstocks today) the solar-electric material would cost 
              about one cent per square meter, and the computers would cost about 
              a dime. Shipping and handling extra.</p>
<p>It may be surprising that a nanofactory could make so wide a range 
              of products. Manufacturing machines today are specialized: plastic-molding 
              machines shape particular kinds of plastic, metal-cutting machines 
              shape particular kinds of metal, and so on. But imagine what people 
              50 years ago would have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> if someone said that a single machine 
              could replace a typewriter, a television, a drawing board, a <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>, 
              a darkroom, a record-player, a pinball machine, and a library. This 
              notion wouldn't have passed the laugh test then, but today we call 
              these machines "computers". They can do all this because 
              their tiny, fast-cycling parts can be directed to form complex patterns 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary building blocks of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, bits. Likewise, 
              molecular manufacturing systems will use tiny, fast-cycling parts, 
              but these can be directed to form complex patterns of the elementary 
              building blocks of matter. As with computers, the effects on the 
              world will be far beyond what anyone can now imagine.</p>
<p>I'd like to describe one that <em>Engines</em> didn't mention, 
              a system that could address <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a>. Molecular machinery 
              can be used to sort gas molecules to extract <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide from 
              air. This requires substantial energy&#8212;the process compresses a gas&#8212;but 
              it can be done with good thermodynamic efficiency. To remove 100 
              parts per million of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as a whole, 
              compressing it to liquid density for long-term storage, would require 
              several terawatts of power for 10 years. This could be provided 
              by solar arrays with the total area of a square roughly 200 kilometers 
              on a side. By providing the necessary molecular machinery and dropping 
              the cost of the arrays, molecular manufacturing can make it affordable 
              to remove and store the excess carbon dioxide that has accumulated 
              since the first <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Abilities of this magnitude may arrive sooner than most would expect. 
              The last 50 years have shown the incredible dynamism of technologies 
              in the microworld. While cars, aircraft, houses, and furniture have 
              changed only moderately in their capabilities and costs, DNA and 
              microelectronic technologies have exploded, expanding their <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 
              capabilities by factors of more than a billion. The developments 
              leading to molecular manufacturing are of a similar sort and will 
              share this dynamism. Past a certain threshold, however, these developments 
              will burst forth from the microworld to transform technologies on 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and even <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary scale. No realistic view of the future 
              can omit this prospect.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>A very good update on the last 20 years of socio-political responses to our understanding and perceptions of nanotechnology.
<br>
<br>
I was particularly interested in reading about Mr. Drexler's global warming proposal.  I remember only a few weeks ago where the owner of Virgin Airlines in England had put up a million or two million dollar prize for anyone who could invent a way to remove the carbon dioxide from the upper atmosphere and start to lessen the main effects of global warming.  I remember also in my readings of advanced nanotechnology how such a proposal had been presented years ago.
<br>
<br>
Bravo for the young and established physicists and chemists who are putting their minds and ethics toward the application of this wonderful gift - the ability to manipulate matter as nature does.
<br>
<br>
To move our economic paradigm from one based on a scarcity of resources to a new economics based on abundance in energy, food, health, and life - makes these days the most exciting days in which to be alive.

Just from two days ago :) PhysOrg is fun, but not enough hours in a day to go through all the articles published.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The physorg article is hardly "nano" and nowhere near molecular assembly.  15 microns is huge.  That bigger than many cells, and way larger than state of the art in semiconductor lithography.
<br>
<br>
And, moving a particle is far different than moving and attaching an atom or molecule.  The first is simple micromanipulation.  The second is also chemistry.
<br>
<br>
So, I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but just want to point out that this is very, very far from a molecular assembler.</p></td>
