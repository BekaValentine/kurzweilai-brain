<p>I was going to say that our next speaker is going to take another way out look at things, but having heard Bruce, let's say relatively way out. He earned a doctorate in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> back in 1963, when he came to America from his native India via another degree in Australia. After teaching for a while at Stanford, he moved to Carnegie Mellon, where he was named a professor in 1973. He is now the Herbert A. Simon University Professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer Science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a>. And he is recognized worldwide for his work on speech recognition and as the founder of the Carnegie Mellon <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a> Institute, which he ran until he took up his present position as dean of the School of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer Science</a> there. He's a member of the National Academy of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering and the American Academy of Arts and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>s. He was president of the American Association for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> from 1987 to 1989. In 1984, he was awarded the French Legion d'Honor for his work on bringing advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to developing countries, and he was awarded the ACM Turing Award in 1995. His ongoing interest is in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> interaction. He has projects running at the moment on speech recognition, multimedia collaboration techniques, just-in-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> lectures and automated <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop. With a background like that, it's all the more interesting that he should choose to talk about something like <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel and <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. I think it promises to tickle the fancy. Ladies and gentlemen, <a class="thought" href="entries/reddy_entry.html">Raj Reddy</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/reddy_entry.html">Raj Reddy</a></h1><p>As we look forward to the next fifty years, it is interesting to note that when the Association for Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>ry was being formed fifty years ago, the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of excitement was no less palpable than it is today. Vannevar Bush had proposed MEMEX with hyperlinks between documents. Turing, having successfully broken the German <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> using a special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, proposed the construction of a universal computing <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> called Ace. John Von Neumann had recently formalized the idea of a stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Eckert and Mauchly had created <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a>, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in the U.S. There's no question that the last fifty years have been exciting, dramatic and, in many ways, full of unanticipated events which have changed our lives.</p>
<p>What will the next fifty years bring? Given the continuing exponential rate of change, it is <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able to assume that the next fifty years will be even more dramatic than the last hundred years. When you recall a hundred years ago, there were no cars and no highways, no electric utilities, no phone <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, no radio or TV, and no airplanes, so you can well imagine the magnitude of the change that awaits us!</p>
<p>In this talk, I'd like to share my <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s on how our dreams about <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel and <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> are likely to be realized. One of our most compelling, enduring fantasies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> has been <b><a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a></b>, where the themes of <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel and <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> have captured the imagination of generations. Will <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> make this possible in the next fifty years? We've heard several possible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>s in the last two days. I'd like to provide you with one more.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> Over the Next 50 Years</h1><p>By the <a class="thought" href="entries/y2k_entry.html">year 2000</a>, we can expect to see a giga-<a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>, a billion operations per second, a billion bits of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and a billion-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> available for less than two thousand dollars. Barring the creation of a cartel or some unforeseen technological barrier, we should see a tera-<a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> by the year 2015 and a peta-<a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> by the year 2030-well before 2047.</p>
<p>The question is, what will we do with all this power? How will it affect the way we live and work? Many things will hardly change; our social <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, the food we eat, the clothes we wear and mating rituals will hardly be affected. Others, such as the way we learn, the way we work, the way we interact with each other and the quality and delivery of health care will undergo profound changes. First and foremost, we can hope that <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> will use some of this computing power to create <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that never fail and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that never needs rebooting. And yes, I can do without the leisure that I get during the boot <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and at the closing <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of the <u><a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> 95</u>, thank you.</p>
<p>The improvement in secondary <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> will be even more dramatic. Many of you know that while the processor and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> technologies have been doubling every twenty-four months or less, disk densities have been doubling every eighteen months or so, leading to a thousandfold improvement every fifteen years. Today, you can buy a four-gigabyte disk <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> for less than four hundred dollars. Four gigabytes can be used to store about ten thousand books of five hundred pages each-larger than most of our personal libraries at home. By the year 2010, we should be able to buy four terabytes for about the same price. At that cost, each of us can have a personal library of several million books, a lifetime collection of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and a lifetime collection of all our favorite movies thrown in-on our home <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. What we don't have on our <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> will be available at the click of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> from the universal <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> library containing all the authored works of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race.</p>
<p>If you choose to, you will be able to capture everything you ever said from the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you are born to your last breath in less than a few terabytes. Everything you ever did and experienced can be stored in less than a petabyte. All of this storage will only cost you a hundred dollars or less by the year 2025</p>
<p>So how will all this affect our lives? We've heard a number of scenarios for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> in the past few days. I'd like to share some of my dreams on how this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be used to save lives, provide <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> and entertainment on a personalized basis, provide universal <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and improve the quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> for the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race.</p>
<p>The first <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> that will have a major impact on society will be the <b>accident avoiding car</b>. Let us look at the current state of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Dr. Charles Thorpe:</b>. The Carnegie Mellon Navlab Project brings together <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> vision, advanced sensors, high-speed processors, planning and control to build <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> vehicles that drive themselves on roads and cross-country. The project began in 1984 as part of ARPA's Autonomous Land Vehicle <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>-the ALV. In the early '80s, most robots were small, slow, indoor vehicles tethered to big <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s . The Stanford cart took fifteen minutes to map obstacles, plan a path and move each meter. The CMU Imp and Neptune improved on the cart's top speed, but still moved in short bursts separated by long periods of looking and <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. In contrast, ARPA's ten-year goals for the ALV were to achieve eighty kilometers per hour on roads, and to travel long distances across open terrain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>With the Terragator, our first outdoor <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> at CMU, we began to make fundamental changes in our approach. The Navlab, built in 1986, was our first self-contained test bed. It had room for onboard generators, onboard sensors, onboard <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and, most importantly, onboard graduate students. The next test bed was the Navlab II, an army ambulance HMMWV. It has many of the sensors used on earlier vehicles, plus cameras on pan-tilt mounts and three aligned cameras for trinocular stereo vision. The HMMWV has high ground clearance for driving on rough terrain and a one hundred and ten kilometer per hour top speed for highway driving. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>-controlled motors turn the steering wheel and control the brake and throttle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Perception and planning capabilities have evolved with the vehicles. Alvin is the current main-road-following vision <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Alvin is a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>, which learns to drive by watching a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> driver. Alvin has driven as far as a hundred kilometers and at speeds over a hundred and ten kilometers per hour. Ranger finds paths through rugged terrain. It takes range images, projects them onto the terrain and builds Cartesian elevation maps. Smartee and D-<a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> find and follow cross-country routes. D-<a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> plans a route using A* <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>. As the vehicle drives, Smartee finds obstacles using Geneesha's map, steers the vehicle around them and passes the obstacles to D-<a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>. D-<a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> adds the new obstacles to it's global map and replans the optimal path.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Currently, Navlab <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is being applied to highway safety. In a recent trip from Washington, D.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. to San Diego, the Navlab 5 Vision <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a> steered autonomously more than ninety-eight percent of the way. In a driver-warning application, the vision <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> watches as a person drives and sounds an alarm if the driver falls asleep and the vehicle drifts off the road. The same autonomous navigation capability is a central part of the automated highway <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, a project that is building completely automated cars, trucks and buses. Automated vehicles will improve safety, decrease congestion and improve mobility for the elderly and disabled.</blockquote>
<p>Every year, about forty thousand people die in automobile accidents, and the annual repair bill is about <i>fifty-five billion dollars</i>! Even if this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> helps to eliminate half of these accidents, the savings would pay for all <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that has been done since the founding of ACM fifty years ago.</p><h1>Toward <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">Teleportation</a></h1><p>The second area of major potential impact on society is <b>telemedicine</b>. Remote medical consultation is already beginning to improve the quality of care for people located in remote areas. With increased <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al capabilities, it will become possible to perform 3-D visualization, remote control of microrobotic surgery and other sophisticated procedures. It's not quite <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a> in the classical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <u><a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a></u>, but consider the following: If you can watch the Super Bowl from the vantage point of a quarterback in the midfield, or repair a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that has fallen down on the surface of Mars or perform telesurgery three thousand miles away, then you have the <a class="thought" href="entries/functional_equivalence_entry.html">functional equivalent</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>-b<i>ringing the world to us, and bringing us to the world, atoms to bits.</i> Let us look at some recent advances in 3-D modeling and multibaseline-in-stereo theory that are essential for being able to do these functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<b>By Dr. Takeo Kanade</b>: A real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 3-D modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> using multibaseline-stereo theory has been developed by Professor Takeo Kanade and other <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers at Carnegie Mellon University. The virtualized reality studio dome is fully covered by many cameras from all directions. The range or depth of every point in an image was computed using the same multibaseline-stereo <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> used in the video-rate stereo <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The scene can be reconstructed with the depth and intensity <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> by placing a virtua, or soft camera from the front, from the left, from the right or from the top, or moving the soft camera as the user moves freely. For this baseball scene, we can create a ball'- eye view. A one-on-one basketball scene has also been virtualized from a number of viewpoints.</blockquote>
<p>Currently this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> requires about a teraflop per second for the 3-D reconstruction of the basketball scene at the video rate. <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">Instrument</a>ing a football field with a dome consisting of ten thousand high-definition cameras will require twenty petaflops of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and a hundred gigabytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> to transmit the 3D Model.</p><h1>Universal <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a></h1><p>Another area that will have a major impact on society will be the creation of a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a><b> library</b>. We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a broad base of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> through the Web, but it is less than one percent of all the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that is available in the archives. We can envision the day when all the authored works of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race will be available to anyone in the world instantaneously. Not just the books, not just the journals or newspapers on demand, but also <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, paintings, and movies. Once you have <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> on demand, you can throw away all of your CDs and just use the Web to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> anything you want. You may just have to pay five cents each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you listen to it-that could be the way it works. This will, in turn, lead to a flood of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> competing for the scarce resource of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> attention. With the predictable advances in summarization and <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> techniques, we should be able to see <i>Gone With The Wind</i> in one hour or less, and the Super Bowl in less than a half hour and not miss any of the fun, including the conclusion in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>

<b>By Dr. Jack Mostow:</b> Illiteracy costs the United States over 225 BILLION dollars annually in <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> retraining, industrial accidents and lost competitiveness. If we can reduce illiteracy by just twenty percent, Project LISTEN could save the nation over 45 BILLION dollars a year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>At Carnegie Mellon University, Project LISTEN is taking a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> approach to the problem of illiteracy. We have developed a prototype automated reading coach that listens to a child read aloud and helps when needed. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is based on the CMU Sphinx II speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The coach provides a combination of reading and listening, in which the child reads wherever possible, and the coach helps wherever necessary--a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> like training wheels on a bicycle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The coach is designed to emphasize comprehension and ignore minor mistakes, such as false starts or repeated words. When the reader gets stuck, the coach jumps in, enabling the reader to complete the sentence. When the reader misses an important word, the coach rereads the words that led up to it, just like the expert reading teachers whom the coach is modeled after. This <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> often helps the reader correct the word on the second try. When the reader runs into more difficulty, the coach rereads the sentence to help the reader comprehend it. The coach's ability to listen enables it to detect when and where the reader needs help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What has been a real plus for the teachers in schools is the fact that children can use it independently. They enjoy reading the stories, and they can prompt the story along. And they're getting some help with individual words that they're struggling with, and they're picking up the meaning of the stories. Experiments to date suggest that it has the potential to reduce children's reading mistakes by a factor of five and enable them to comprehend material at least six months more advanced than they can read on their own.</blockquote><h1>Toward <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Travel</h1><p>So this brings us to the prospect of using <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel as an <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al tool.

<blockquote>EINSTEIN</blockquote>
<blockquote>I was born on March 14, 1879 in a small town in southern Germany called Ulm. I don't remember it. I remember Munich, whereto my Papa moved the family when I was just one year old.

<blockquote><a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> is very worthy of regard. But an inner voice tells me that this is not the true Jacob.

<p>So, if we had captured Einstein in living color and 3-D when he was alive, it would be technically possible today to have an imaginary conversation with him. The people responsible for this synthetic interview at the Grand Illusion Studios, which is a spin off from Carnegie Mellon, are hoping to create a service which will permit you to converse with your great, great, great grandchildren in the same way. This is not quite the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel that you've grown to expect from <i><a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a></i>, but it's another example of substituting <i>bits for atoms</i> to achieve an equivalent experience. With some pre-planning and appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> capture, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations will be able to experience historical events first-hand and interact with the past generations.</p><h1>Toward <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a></h1><p>There is work underway in areas such as geriatric <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> that will help senior citizens with simple disabilities lead normal lives well past their prime. And you may ask, can this go on forever? Transplant surgeries are one way of extending <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy beyond a hundred years or so, and given advances in cloning, we may be getting closer to achieving the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. But as Nathan Myhrvold pointed out, you need to <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> extragenetic experiences-the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> in your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, not just the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. One possibility would be to bring you back to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the fourth millennium using a frozen <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> of your <a class="thought" href="entries/clone_entry.html">clone</a> and then infusing you with all the experiences you've undergone in this lifetime. <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a> should not be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as some mystical transfer of atoms from one <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to the other as in the <i><a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a></i> movies. It should be viewed from an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> perspective whereby you provide the <a class="thought" href="entries/clone_entry.html">clone</a> with all the important extragenetic experiences of everything you ever said and did. Then you create a rapid, simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> environment in which the new <a class="thought" href="entries/clone_entry.html">clone</a>, with a new <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, which can live on for another generation, gets all of your experiences--<i>bits for atoms.</i> It's not quite immortal in the classical <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the word, but close enough, especially given that the cloning process can go on every millennium. That way you will live forever, except you will be <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> the cumulative experiences of all the generations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the advances of the next fifty years will undoubtedly be as dramatic as the last fifty. Capabilities such as accident-avoiding cars, universal <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, entertainment on demand, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> on demand, reading tutors, telemedicine and geriatric <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> will clearly come to pass. More esoteric capabilities such as <a class="thought" href="entries/teleportation_entry.html">teleportation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> travel and <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> will also become possible, raising a number of social and ethical questions. As a society, we have to find ways of dealing with these things. As we find ways to transform <i>atoms to bits</i>, that is, substitute <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, many of the constants of our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> will assume a new meaning and will change the way we live and work. This means some of us will have superhuman capabilities, like getting a year's worth of work done in a week. Such capabilities can be used to further increase the gap between the haves and have-nots, or to help the poor, the sick and the illiterate. The choice, I believe is up to us.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have achieved Immortality. On June 28th, at dusk I was attached by a swarm of mosquitos.I was working outside in my five acre plant nurserypulling weeds.These mosquitos were very small and when I was bit it did not swell or itch , so I continued working .I must have been bitten hundreds of times all over my body.The next day I woke up immobilised with illness. For seven days I laid in my water bed ,so sick I did not eat or drink or go to the toilet . Idid not have the strength to take my temp,I knew I had a terrible fever. All through my life when I went to the doctors office with a virus I was told there is nothing to be done but let it run its course,so I did. Untill July 5th. a few minutes to midnight,when I mustered up enough strength to go in to the bathroom and take my temperature.
<br>
I looked at the thermometer and saw that I had a 105 degree temp. I looked in the mirror and saw my face for the first time in a week, it was death ,I looked back at the thermometer and then back in the mirror and laughed.I knew I was dying 
<br>
I said to myself well I guess this is it,I am going into the unknown, but instead of being affraid I was giddy in antipication ready for the trip.I walked back into my bedroom and lied down in my waterbed.The next thing that occured was I had this thought what if my next breath was my last? It was ,I thougkt It is my will THY WILL BE DONE FATHER and with that positive affirmation of will I achieved the birth of my Immortal soul which up untill then was meerly a seed.I call this positive affirmation  AT ONE MENT of WILL.With this AT ONE MENT I could feel my life leaving my body, it started at the tip of my toes and rose up thru my blood till it hit my heart when it was an instantaneous jump to my brain . My mind which had the thought of AT ONE MENT and my self left my body. With that all matter faded away all was black , darkness , nothingness.I went through the PORTAL OF DEATH, but with a conscious ,unconciousness,super concious . I saw Jesus Christ The Paradise Creator Michael Son Of THE FATHER,on the other side of the portal with HIS Spirit body HIS hand reaching for me.Just then this other brilliant spirit being came up from below  the depth of the darkness of nothingnerss and put this bog pile of crap in front of me and said how dare you reach for JESUS after all this you have done? I looked at him then looked at JESUS still reaching for me and said , begone Evil prince and with that he disappeared. I went withJESUS the CHRIST MICHAEL  into the unknown and was taught tellapathically by HIM for exactly seven hours.This all ocurred at the stroke of midnight .I awoke at exactly 7am the next morning totally cured but in a state of a kind of amnesia,which took three days to go away. When it did I remembered all that happened and I remembered JESUS telling me that HE wanted me to return to my body and tell all what happened to me . He said that because I was able to go through the portal of death with absolutely no fear and total Faith and Trust in THE UNSEEN FATHER that I could take up my life again. I was in step with the UNIVERSE . I argued with JESUS Iwanted to go on my journey into the unknown but HE convinced me to take up my life again, and be HIS messenger of good tidings .DEATH IS CONQUERED.Have Faith and trust totally and all will be alright.Greg Garret an IMMORTAL.</p></td>
