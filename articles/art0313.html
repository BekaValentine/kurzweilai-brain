<div class="TeaserText">From <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s revolutionary book <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">The Age of Intelligent Machines</a>, published in 1990.</div>

<br><h1>The First <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a></h1><blockquote>The German aircraft is the best in the world. I cannot see what we could possibly calculate to improve on. </blockquote>
<blockquote>A German officer explaining to Konrad Zuse why the Third Reich would provide no further support for development of Zuse's Z series of computers</blockquote>
<blockquote>I won't say that what Turing did made us win the war, but I dare say we might have lost it without him. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I. J. Good, assistant to Turing</blockquote>
<blockquote>I remember when we first got pulses circulating rather precariously. Every time we switched on the light in the room, another pulse went in and that was the only input that in fact we had. Then later we made a half-adder work and saw our <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a> pulses counting up on an oscilloscope screen. Then we got the accumulator working and then the whole arithmetic unit, and so on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We were a small, informal group in those days and whenever we had anything to celebrate, we adjourned to the local pub. It was a pub well known to generations of workers in the Cambridge University Laboratories. It was known as the Bun Shop, though I think they'd be very surprised indeed if you tried to buy a bun there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We had a special celebration on the 6th of May, 1949, when the <a class="thought" href="entries/edsac_entry.html">EDSAC</a> did its first calculation, which was a table of squares, and a few days later it did a table of primes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sam Alexander has reminded me about the first substantial <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> I wrote which was for computing Airy functions by solving the Airy differential equation, and in connection with that, I made a discovery. I discovered <a class="thought" href="entries/debugging_entry.html">debugging</a>. Now you probably won't believe me and I don't know whether my colleagues around this table had the same <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, but it just had not occurred to me that there was going to be any difficulty about getting programs working. And it was with somewhat of a shock that I realized that for the rest of my life I was going to spend a good deal of my time finding mistakes that I had made myself in programs. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Maurice V. Wilkes</blockquote>
<p>Unlike such other epoch-making inventions as the telephone or the electric lightbulb, most people cannot recite who invented the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> is that who invented the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of how one defines "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>." Another is that by most accepted definitions the first functioning computers were developed independently and virtually at the same time in three different countries, one of which was at war with the other two.</p>
<p>It is clear, however, that during World War II the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> was an idea whose time had come. The theoretical foundations had been laid decades earlier by Babbage, Boole, Russell, and others, and many design principles had been worked out by Babbage, Burroughs, Hollerith, and their peers.<sup>1</sup> With the advent of reliable electromechanical relays for <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>) tubes for radio <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, the building blocks for a practical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> had finally become available.</p><h2>The German Z machines</h2><p>It appears that the world's first fully programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> was invented in Germany during the Third Reich by a civil engineer named Konrad Zuse.<sup>2</sup> Zuse's original motivation was to automate what he later called those "awful calculations" required of civil engineers.<sup>3</sup> He saw the computational bottleneck as bringing his field of applied <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to a virtual standstill. With little theoretical background (Zuse was unaware of the work of Babbage and other developments that were influential in precomputer <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>) and great skill as a tinkerer, Zuse set out to ease the unenviable task of calculating the huge tables of numbers required for civil engineering projects.</p>
<p>His first <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, the Z-1 (the names of Zuse's inventions originally used the letter V, but this was later changed so as not to cause confusion between his machines and the German rocket bombs), was an entirely mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> built from an erector set in his parents' living room. The Z-2 was a more sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> using electromechanical relays, and though not programmable, it was capable of solving complex simultaneous equations. The Z-2 attracted the attention of <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> aircraft developers, and Zuse received some level of support for further development, although this was informal and not at a high level.</p>
<p>Zuse's most significant <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> is the Z-3, the world's first programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, completed in late 1941. It had a <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of 1,408 bits organized as 64 words of 22 bits each. In addition to 1,408 relays to support the <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">random access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, it used another 1,200 relays for the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">central processing unit</a>. As with all of the relay-based computers, it was quite slow: a multiplication took more than 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Besides its importance as a fully functioning <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>-controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, it employed a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of other innovations. Zuse reinvented <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_polish_notation_entry.html">reverse Polish notation</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of expressing any formula no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how complex by successive pairs of numbers and operators, originally developed two decades earlier by the Polish mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz.<sup>4</sup> It also introduced floating-point numbers, a form of notation that can represent a broad range of magnitudes. Zuse went on to develop in 1945 the first high-level <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, called Plankalkul, which foreshadowed modern programming languages such as <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> in its lack of a GOTO statement and structured methodology. The first programmer of the Z-3, and thereby the world's first programmer of an <i>operational</i> programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, was August Fast, a man chosen by Zuse for both his talent as a mathematician and his blindness. Zuse apparently reasoned that being blind, Fast would not be called for <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> service!</p>
<p>A variation of Zuse's Z-3 was apparently used by the Germans in the design and manufacture of one of the Nazi's flying bombs, the <i>HS-293</i>, although Zuse has denied this.<sup>5</sup> After the war British <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a> classified Zuse as an "ardent Nazi," which he has not convincingly denied.<sup>6</sup> What is perhaps most interesting about the Zuse computers is the lack of importance given to them by the Nazi war <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The German <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> gave immensely high priority to several advanced technologies, such as rocketry and atomic weapons, yet they seem to have put no priority at all on computers. While Zuse received some incidental support and his machines played a minor <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> role, there was little if any awareness of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and its <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> significance by the German leadership. The potential for using computers for a broad range of <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> calculations from plotting missile trajectories and <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a> designs to decrypting <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> messages seems to have escaped Nazi attention, despite the fact that the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was first developed under their aegis.<sup>7</sup> The motivation for developing the world's first programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> came primarily from Zuse's own intense focus as an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>.<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<p>Nor did anyone in other countries pay much attention to Zuse's work. Credit for the world's first programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is often given to Howard Aiken, despite the fact that his Mark I was not operational until nearly three years after the Z-3. Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry developed largely in the United States after the war, one might expect hesitation to recognize a German, an accused Nazi, as the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of the programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. On the other hand, allied pride did not stop the United States from harnessing German know-how in the development of the rocket, nuclear weapons, or atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>. Zuse, on the other hand, was largely ignored by the Americans, just as he had been by the Germans: both <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> and Remington Rand turned down offers of assistance and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> rights from Zuse after the war. He started his own company in Germany, which continued to build relay-based Z-series machines, although never in large quantities. The last, the Z-11, is still being used.<sup>9</sup>
</p><h2>Ultra</h2><p>Unlike the Germans, the British did recognize the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> value of automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, at least for the decryption of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> messages. As recounted earlier, the ability of the machines built by <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> and his associates to provide a constant stream of decoded German <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> messages was instrumental in turning the tide of war. The size of the effort, code-named Ultra, consisting of almost 10,000 men and women, is a testament to the strategic priority given to computers by the British during the war.<sup>10</sup> Ultra created two series of machines. <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>, completed in early 1940 and based on electromechanical relay <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, was powerful enough to decode messages from the Germans' first-generation Enigma enciphering <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Was <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>, completed in early 1940, the world's first operational <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>?</p>
<p>According to our definition, <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> was a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, although not a programmable one: it had a single hard-wired <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. We can consider it, therefore, to be the world's first operational <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. When the Germans increased the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of their Enigma <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> by adding additional coding rotors, <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> was no longer fast enough, and the Ultra team set out to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> using <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> tubes, which were a hundred to a thousand times faster than the relays used in <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>. The new <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, called <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a>, required 1500 tubes, a significant technical challenge in view of the short life span and lack of reliability of <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> tubes.<sup>11</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> worked reliably nonetheless and was able to keep up with the increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the German messages. The Ultra group considered <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> to be the world's first <i>electronic</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, although they were unaware of the earlier efforts of John Atanasoff, an obscure American <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>.</p><h2>The Americans</h2><p>Working for five years, a team of Harvard and <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> scientists led by Howard Aiken, a navy commander, completed in 1944 what they <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> was the world's first programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.<sup>12</sup> Many still consider their creation, the Mark I, the first general-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, despite Zuse's having built such a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, still awkward, but three years earlier. The Americans were obviously unaware of Zuse (as we have seen, the Germans were hardly aware of him), and they were only dimly aware of the British efforts. The American high command did know that the British were using electromechanical and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> equipment to decode German messages, but did not have details of the process. Turing visited the United States in 1942 and apparently talked with John von Neumann (1903-1957), a mathematician, but had little impact on the American development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> until after the war, at which time there was extensive American-English discussion on the subject of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.<sup>13</sup> The formal name for the Mark I, the <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> Automatic Sequence Controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">Calculator</a>, is reminiscent of the original names of other pivotal inventions, such as "<a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> telephone" for the radio and "horseless carriage" for the automobile.<sup>14</sup>
</p>
<p>The United States Navy made Aiken available to the Mark I project, as they realized the potential value of an automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> to a wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> problems. Realizing the potential <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> value of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> provided virtually all of the funding, $500,000. Harvard's motivation was to transform the tabulating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> into a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that could perform scientific calculations. The resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> was enormous: fifty feet long and eight feet high. It was affectionately called "the monster" by one of its first programmers, Navy Captain Grace Murray Hopper.<sup>15</sup>
</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> used decimal notation and represented numbers with 23 digits. Input data was read from punched cards, and the output was either punched onto cards or typed. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> was read from punched paper tape and was not stored but rather executed as read.</p>
<p>Grace Murray Hopper has sometimes been called the Ada Lovelace of the Mark I. Just as Ada Lovelace pioneered the programming of <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a> (despite the fact that the <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a> never ran), Captain Hopper was the moving force in harnessing the power of the Mark I. On assignment from the Navy and having lost her husband in the war, she devoted most of her waking hours to programming the Mark I and its successors, the Mark II and Mark III. She was one of the first to recognize the value of libraries of subroutines, is credited with having written the first high-level <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>, and led the effort to develop the Common Business-Oriented <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/cobol_entry.html">COBOL</a>), the first <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> not identified with a particular manufacturer.<sup>16</sup> She is also associated with the origin of the term "debug." One problem with the Mark I was fixed by removing a moth that had died inside one of its relays. "From then on," she recalls, "whenever anything went wrong with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, we said it had bugs in it. If anyone asked if we were accomplishing anything, we replied that we were '<a class="thought" href="entries/debugging_entry.html">debugging</a>'."<sup>17</sup>
</p>
<p>The Mark I generated considerable interest in many quarters, but a severe limitation soon became apparent. With its electromechanical relay <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it was capable of only a few calculations each second. The only real solution was to build a programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> without moving parts, which was accomplished when two professors at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, J. Presper Eckert, Jr. (b. 1902) and John W. Mauchly (1907-1980), completed work on their famous <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Numerical Integrator and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>) in 1946. Using 18,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> tubes (12 times as many as <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a>, which had been considered ambitious only five years earlier!), it was capable of 5,000 calculations per second, making it almost a thousand times faster than Aiken's Mark I. Early press coverage included reports of the <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> accomplishing in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of hours what would have required a year for a hundred scientists. It was from these reports that terms such as "super brain" and "<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a>" first became associated with computers. Conceived in 1943, the <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> was originally intended for <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> applications; however, it was not completed in time for service in World War II. It ultimately served a wide variety of both <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> and civilian purposes, including <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> studies, designing atomic weapons, numerical analysis, weather prediction, and product design.<sup>18</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> was undoubtably the world's first fully <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> general-purpose (programmable) <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, although this claim, as well as the validity of the patents for <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a>, was challenged in 1973 by John V. Atanasoff (b. 1903), a professor at Iowa State College. Judge Earl Larson found in favor of Atanasoff, stating that "Eckert and Mauchly did not invent the automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but rather derived the subject <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> from Atanasoff."<sup>19</sup> Working with a part-time graduate student Clifford Berry, Atanasoff did indeed build an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, called ABC (for Atanasoff-Berry <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>), in 1940.<sup>20</sup> Although a relatively unsophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> with only 800 tubes, it could compute simultaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> equations using <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a> representations of the variables. It was revealed during the trial that Mauchly had visited Atanasoff while the <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> was being designed. The judge, however, misunderstood the distinguishing feature and primary claim of the <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a>, which was its ability to be <i>programmed</i>-Atanasoff's ABC was not programmable. Fortunately, despite the court's finding, credit for building the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that was both programmable and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> continues properly to be given to Eckert and Mauchly. This is a prime example of the challenges faced by the courts in adjudicating issues with substantial technical <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>, particularly at times when the issues have yet to be fully understood by the technical community.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> represented the first time that the public became fascinated with the potential for machines to perform mental functions at "astonishing" speeds. Although many of today's computers are a thousand times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> (and our fastest supercomputers are almost a million times faster), the speed problem exhibited by the Mark I seemed to have been solved by <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a>. Yet this led to yet another bottleneck. Loading a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> into the <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> involved setting 6,000 switches and connecting hundreds of cables. The incredible tedium required to <i>change</i> the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> gave birth to a new <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> called the <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a> and to an <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> that computers still use today.<sup>21</sup> The <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> is generally associated with the great Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann, and we still refer to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a single <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">central processing unit</a> (the primary computational <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) accessing its <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> from the same <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> (or same type of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>) that holds the data to be manipulated as a von Neumann <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Although the first modern paper on the subject, published in 1946, carried only von Neumann's name, the idea was not his alone. It clearly resulted from discussions that von Neumann had with both Eckert and Mauchly. In fact, the first reference to the <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> can be found in Babbage's writings a century earlier, although his <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a> did not employ the idea.</p>
<p>The idea of a <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a> is deceptively simple: the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is stored in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> in the same way that data is stored.<sup>22</sup> In this way the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> can be changed as easily as reading in new data. Indeed, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a> computers read in their programs from the same punched-card readers used to read in the data. A <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a> is more than a convenience, it supports certain types of algorithmic methods that would otherwise be impossible, including the use of subroutines, self-modifying code, and <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a>, all of which are essential capabilities for programming most <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> applications. It is hard to imagine writing a chess <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, for example, that does not make use of <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a>.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>Eckert and Mauchly set out to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to be called <a class="thought" href="entries/edvac_entry.html">EDVAC</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Discrete Variable Automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>) while they were still at the Moore School. They subsequently left Moore to start their own company, the Eckert-Mauchly <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Corporation, and the completion of <a class="thought" href="entries/edvac_entry.html">EDVAC</a> was left to others. This delayed the project, and it was not until 1951 that <a class="thought" href="entries/edvac_entry.html">EDVAC</a> was completed. As a result, though <a class="thought" href="entries/edvac_entry.html">EDVAC</a> was the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> designed to incorporate stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> capability, it was not the first to be completed. Eckert and Mauchly's new company brought out <a class="thought" href="entries/binac_entry.html">BINAC</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">Binary</a> Automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>) in 1949. <a class="thought" href="entries/binac_entry.html">BINAC</a> was not the world's first stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, either. Maurice Wilkes, a professor at Oxford University, had taken a course on computers with Eckert and Mauchly while they were still teaching at the Moore School. Returning to England after completion of the course, he set out to build his own <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> incorporating the stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> that he had learned from Eckert and Mauchly's course. Wilkes's <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, called <a class="thought" href="entries/edsac_entry.html">EDSAC</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Delay Storage Automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>), was completed a few months before <a class="thought" href="entries/binac_entry.html">BINAC</a>, making it the world's first operational stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.<sup>23</sup>
</p><h2>The commercialization of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a></h2><p>After building only two BINACs and without adequate financial backing to commercially develop a complex new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, Eckert and Mauchly sold their firm to Remington Rand in 1950. By 1951 a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/univac_entry.html">UNIVAC</a> (Universal Automatic <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>), which Eckert and Mauchly had started several years earlier, was introduced as the world's first commercially marketed <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. The first customer, appropriately enough, was the U.S. Census Bureau; the 1950 census was the first to be handled by a programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>Legend has it that Remington-Rand conducted a marketing study for their new product, which indicated a potential worldwide market for only 50 computers. This story is difficult to confirm, but it is true that <a class="thought" href="entries/univac_entry.html">UNIVAC</a> was not a <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> success. <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, however, took the introduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/univac_entry.html">UNIVAC</a> very seriously, viewing it as a threat to their dominant position in tabulating equipment, and shortly thereafter introduced the first of their 700 series of computers (the 701, 702, 704, and 705). The 700 series became so popular that <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> was quickly positioned to dominate the still nascent industry. The 700 series led to <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>'s 1400 series (1401 and 1410) and 7000 series (7030, 7040, 7070, 7074, 709T for transistors, 7090, and 7094), which became standards for large <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> customers and scientific installations. With the introduction of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>'s 360 series in 1964, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> based on 32-bit words that continues to form the basis for <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> mainframes, <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> solidified its leadership of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry and became one of the largest and most profitable corporations in the world.<sup>24</sup>

<p>With at least a dozen inventors having some credible claim to having been "first" in the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, we can say that the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> emerged not from a lone innovator's basement, but rather from a rich period of intellectual ferment on several continents drawing upon a <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of intellectual traditions and fueled by the exigencies of war. And if there were a dozen fathers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, there were at least a couple dozen fathers of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<p>The notion of creating a new form of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> on earth emerged with an intense and often uncritical passion simultaneously with the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> on which it was to be based. The similarity of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> logic to at least some aspects of our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process was not lost on any of the designers of the early machines. Zuse, for example, applied his Z series of computers and Plankalkul <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to the problem of chess. Turing's contributions to the foundations of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> are extensive and well known. Turing's 1950 classic paper "Computing Machinery and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>" lays out an agenda that would in fact occupy the next quarter century of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>: game playing, <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding and translation, theorem proving, and of course, the cracking of codes.<sup>25</sup> Even Nathaniel Rochester, the designer of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>'s first successful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the 701, spent several years developing early <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; in fact, he was one of the principals in the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, which gave <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> its name.<sup>26</sup>
</p>
<p>Perhaps the odd man out was John von Neumann, who found himself unable to imagine that the cumbersome and unreliable <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> tubes used to build the first <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> computers could ever compete with the human brain.<sup>27</sup> Even though the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> had been invented when von Neumann expressed his skepticism, its applicability to computing had not yet been realized. More significant than the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> limitations, however, was the hopelessness, according to von Neumann, of ever describing natural human actions and decision making in the precise <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. To some extent, von Neumann may have been reacting to the unrealistic expectations that had been set in the popular media of the time: magazine covers were predicting that superhuman <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> brains were just around the corner. Von Neumann did, however, show considerable interest in the idea of expressing human <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> using the formalism of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_language_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. The depth of his resistance to the idea that at least some behaviors we associate with natural <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> might ultimately be automated is difficult to gauge; von Neumann died in 1957, shortly before he was to give a series of lectures at Yale on the likelihood of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.<sup>28</sup>
</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a>: A new weltanschauung</h2><p>The emergence of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, its early application to cognitive problems, the development of the theoretical foundations of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, and related speculation on the implications of this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> had a profound impact on fundamental tenets of what we might call the scientific worldview. In <i>Cybernetics</i>, Norbert Wiener's seminal book on <a class="thought" href="entries/information_theory_entry.html">information theory</a>, Wiener describes three ways in which the world's (and his own) outlook had changed forever.<sup>29</sup>
</p>
<p>Wiener, a prodigy who had studied with both Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert and received his Ph.D. from Harvard at the age of 18, had mastered an unusually broad range of intellectual fields from <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> and neurophysiology to <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>.<sup>30</sup> His book was intended to establish as a new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">cybernetics</a>, which he defines in his subtitle as control and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. In sections that are alternately addressed to the lay reader and to his fellow mathematicians, Wiener expounds his three premises.</p>
<p>First is the change from <i>energy</i> to <i>information</i>. Precybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> consists of particles and the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> fields that control them. Accordingly, the old model of life was concerned primarily with the conversion of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in its various biochemical and physical forms.<sup>31</sup> If the living cell was a heat <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> in the early twentieth century, it had now become a small <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. The new cybernetic model treats <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> as the fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> in living things as well as in intelligent things, living or otherwise. In this new view, the most important transactions taking place in a living cell are the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing transactions inherent in the creation, copying, and manipulation of the amino acid strings we call proteins. <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> is required for the transmission and manipulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in both <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, but this is regarded as incidental.</p>
<p>In recent times, with <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-handling circuits becoming smaller and using ever smaller amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> has indeed become incidental to the process. The primary issue today in measuring <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-handling systems is the amount and speed of their data processing capabilities. Edward Fredkin has recently shown that though <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is needed for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage and retrieval, we can arbitrarily reduce the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required to perform any particular example of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing, and there is no lower limit to the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required.<sup>32</sup> In theory, at least, the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required to perform <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> can become arbitrarily close to zero. Fredkin's argument is significant in establishing that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing is fundamentally different from <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> processing. Even without Fredkin's theoretical argument, the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required for <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is not a significant issue today, although it was a bit of an issue in Wiener's day.<sup>33</sup> The lights in Philadelphia were reported to have dimmed when <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a>, with its 18,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> tubes, was turned on, although this story is probably exaggerated.</p>
<p>The decoupling of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> is also important from an economic point of view. The value of many products today is becoming increasingly dominated by <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. As <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> itself becomes less dependent on both raw materials and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, we are moving from an economy based on material and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> resources to one based on <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.<sup>34</sup>
</p>
<p>A second aspect of what Wiener saw as an epochal change in scientific outlook is characterized by the trend away from <i>analog</i> toward <i>digital</i>.<sup>35</sup> Wiener argues that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> ultimately needed to be "numerical . . . rather than on the basis of measurement, as in the Bush Differential Analyzer." When computing first emerged, there was a controversy between <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing, with the Differential Analyzer of Vannevar Bush (1890-1974), President Roosevelt's <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> advisor, as a popular example of the former.<sup>36</sup> In an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, mathematical operations are performed by adding, subtracting, or even multiplying electrical quantities and then measuring the amount of voltage or current after the operations are performed. A very simple example is the common thermostat. Through the use of feedback loops, fairly complex formulas can be represented, although accuracy is limited by the resolution of the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> components.<sup>37</sup> In a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> or process, numbers are represented not by amounts of voltage or current but rather by assembling numbers from multiple bits, where each bit is either on (generally representing 1) or off (generally representing 0). To many observers at the time, it was not clear which type of computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> would become dominant. Today we generally do not find the need to use the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>" before the word "<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>," since <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computers are no longer common, although in Wiener's time, this was a necessary modifier. Wiener saw the limitations of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing in terms of both accuracy and the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the algorithms that could be implemented. With a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> there is no theoretical limit on either accuracy or computational <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.<sup>38</sup>
</p>
<p>The trend from <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>, which was just getting started in Wiener's day, continues to revolutionize a growing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of technologies and industries. The compact <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> disk and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> audio tape are revolutionizing the recording of music. <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is replacing the piano and other acoustic and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> musical instruments. A new generation of aircraft is being controlled by highly accurate <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> control mechanisms replacing <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and mechanical methods. Phones and copiers     are becoming <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>. There are many other examples.<sup>39</sup>
</p>
<p>However, the question of whether the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> continues to be an important philosophical issue. As we delve deeper and deeper into both natural and artificial processes, we find the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the process often alternates between <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representations of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Consider, for example, three processes related to listening to a compact-disk recording: the reproduction of the sound from the compact disk recording, the musical understanding of the audio signal by the listener, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the data structures in music itself.<sup>40</sup>
</p>
<p>First consider the reproduction process. The music is communicated to the listener by vibrations of the air, which are clearly an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>. The electrical signals sent to the loudspeaker are also <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>. The circuits interpreting the contents of the compact disk are, however, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> circuits that are computing the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> values to be played as sound. The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> values computed by the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> circuits are converted into <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> electrical signals by a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> called a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> converter. Thus, the sound exists in a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representation prior to it being converted to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> electrical signals to be amplified, which is why we consider compact disk <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.<sup>41</sup>
</p>
<p>Let us now look at these <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> circuits. As in many modern <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> products, these circuits are packaged into tiny integrated circuits containing thousands or tens of thousands of transistors each. It is interesting to note that while the circuits are <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>, the transistors that comprise them are inherently <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> devices. The designers of the transistors themselves do not consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> but rather are very aware of its inherently <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> because it acts as a small electrical amplifier and deals with variable (continuous-valued) amounts of current.<sup>42</sup> They are "tricked" into acting <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> (with values of on or off) by thresholding (comparing values to a constant) their otherwise <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> (continuous-valued) characteristics. But a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> cannot model a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> perfectly; it will compute the wrong <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> value some small fraction of the time. This is not a problem in practice. Using the very <a class="thought" href="entries/information_theory_entry.html">information theory</a> created by Wiener and an associate of his, Claude Elwood Shannon, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> designers can make the likelihood that the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> will malfunction in its <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> role so low that they can essentially ignore this possibility and thus consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> to be a reliable <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>.<sup>43</sup>
</p>
<p>On a deeper level we can understand the continuous levels of current within one <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> to be ultimately discrete: they are made up of a very large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> electrons with <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> quantum states. So now we are back to a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> view of things. But when we consider the Heisenberg <a class="thought" href="entries/uncertainty_principle_entry.html">uncertainty principle</a>, which tells us that the electrons have no precise locations but only probability clouds of possible locations, we are back to a fuzzy (<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>) model of the world.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>As we approach finer and finer models of the world, <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> flips several times between the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> conceptions of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. Consider now the path of the music sounds going toward the listener. The <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> sound waves vibrate the ear drum and ultimately enter the cochlea, a natural <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> that acts as a spectrum (pitch) analyzer. The cochlea breaks up the sound waves into distinct frequency bands and emits a digitally encoded representation of the time-varying spectrum of the sound. This <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representation enters the acoustic cortex of the brain, where processing takes place by techniques that are both <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>.<sup>44</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of music itself with its elements of melody, rhythm, <a class="thought" href="entries/harmony_entry.html">harmony</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, and timbre. The first three elements, which are the elements represented by musical notation, are clearly <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. The availability of music notation processors, which are to music notation what word processors are to written <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, are a clear testament to the inherently <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of these     three musical elements. Melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic structures are modeled in music theory by the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> logic rather than the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">Expression</a> and timbre, on the other hand, though they certainly can be represented using <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> means, are nonetheless <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.<sup>45</sup>
</p>
<p>It is clear that we use both <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> approaches in understanding     the world around us. As we view phenomena at different levels of specificity and detail, we find their <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> changes repeatedly. The ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is still being debated. Edward Fredkin has recently proposed what he calls a new theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> stating that the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> of the world is <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> (that is, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>). According to Fredkin, we should not think of ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> as particles and forces but rather as bits of data modified according to computational rules. If, in fact, particles are quantized in terms of their locations and other properties, then the views of the world as made up of particles and as made up of data are essentially equivalent. Though Fredkin's view has startled contemporary theoreticians, it is just another way of postulating a fully quantized or <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world. The alternative <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> view would state that the position or at least one of the properties of a <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> is not quantized but is either continuous or uncertain.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ultimate <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the world, Wiener's prediction of a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> conception of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> was both profound and prophetic. From a technological and economic point of view, the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> approach continues to replace the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>, transforming whole industries in the process. The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> outlook has also permeated our philosophical and scientific views of the world. </p>
<p>An additional comment on the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> versus <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> concerns another contemporary controversy. Some observers have criticized <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing as a means of replicating human cognition because of its all or nothing <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, which refers to the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> bits are either on or off with no states in between. This, according to these observers, contrasts with the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> processes in the human brain, which can deal with uncertain <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and are able to balance decisions based on "soft" inputs. Thus, they say, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> methods that can deal with gradations on a continuous scale will be needed to successfully emulate the brain.</p>
<p>My reaction to this is that the argument is based on a misconception, but I     nonetheless agree with the conclusion that we will see a return to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing, alongside <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> techniques, particularly for <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>-recognition tasks. The argument that <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> techniques are all or nothing is clearly misleading. By building numbers (including fractional parts) from multiple bits, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> techniques can also represent gradations, and with a greater degree of continuity and precision than <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> techniques-indeed, with any degree of precision desired. New <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_engineering_entry.html">knowledge engineering</a> techniques that use a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/fuzzy_logic_entry.html">fuzzy logic</a> can apply <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing to decision making in a way that utilizes imprecise and relative <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in a methodologically sound manner. Often the criticism of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing is really aimed at the type of "hard" antecedent-consequent type of logic employed in the first generation of expert systems. Overcoming the limitations of this type of logic does not require resorting to <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> techniques.</p>
<p>There is, however, a good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that we are likely to see a return to hybrid <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing designs. <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a> computing is substantially less expensive in terms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of components required for certain arithmetic operations. Adding or even multiplying two quantities in an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> requires only a few transistors, whereas a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> approach can require hundreds of components. With integrated-<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> providing hundreds of thousands or even millions of components on a single chip, this difference is usually not significant and the greater precision of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing generally wins out. But consider the trend toward massive <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a>, in which a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> performs many computations simultaneously rather than just one at a time, as is the case in the classical von Neumann <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>. For certain types of problems, such as visual image analysis, it would be desirable to be able to perform millions of computations at the same time (computing the same transformations on every pixel (point) of a high resolution image, for example). Often these calculations do not require a high degree of accuracy, so performing them with <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> techniques would be very cost effective. Doing a million computations simultaneously with <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> methods would be practical with today's <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> but still prohibitively expensive with <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> techniques. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> apparently found the same engineering trade-off when it designed the human brain.</p>
<p>The third major theme of Wiener's treatise concerns the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of time. He argues that we have gone from a reversible or Newtonian <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of time to an irreversible or Bergsonian notion of time. Wiener regards Newtonian time as reversible because if we run a Newtonian world backward in time, it will continue to follow Newton's laws. The directionality of time has no significance in Newtonian <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. Wiener used Bergson, a biologist who analyzed the cause and effect relationships in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, as a <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> for the irreversibility of time in any world in which <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing is important.</p>
<p>Computing is generally not time reversible, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this is somewhat surprising. There are two types of computing transformations, one in which <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is preserved and one in which <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is destroyed. The former type is reversible. If <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is preserved, we can reverse the transformation and restore the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to the format it had prior to the transformation. If <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is destroyed, however, then that process is not reversible, since the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> needed to restore a state no longer exists. Consider, for example, a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that writes zeros throughout <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and ultimately destroys (most of) <br>

<br>
<span class="Caption">Two types of computing transformations: the preserver and the destroyer.</span>
<br> itself. We cannot conceive of a way to reverse this process, since the original contents of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> are no longer anywhere to be retrieved. This is surprising because we ordinarily think of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> as a process that creates new <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from old. After all, we run a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> process to obtain answers to problems, that is, to create new <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, not to destroy old <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. The irreversibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is often cited as a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is useful: it transforms <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a unidirectional "purposeful" manner. Yet the derivation of the proof that <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is irreversible is based on the ability of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> to destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, not to create it. Another view, however, is that the value of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> is precisely its ability to destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> selectively. For example, in a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> task such as recognizing images or speech sounds, preserving the invariant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-bearing features of a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> while "destroying" the enormous amount of data in the original image or sounds is essential to the process. In fact, <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is often a process of selecting relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> carefully from a much larger amount of unprocessed data. This is essentially a process of skillful and purposeful destruction of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>Wiener points out that a model of time that is irreversible is essential to the concepts of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. One entertaining example cited by Wiener is the impossibility of two intelligent entities attempting to communicate when they are "traveling" in different directions in time. Neither one will perceive the other as either responsive or intelligent. <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>, and reversible time to irreversible time are all facets of the same revolution in worldview known as <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. It was a revolution both for the world at large and for Wiener himself. It is interesting to note that virtually all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> in Wiener's book is not that of the logician and computationalist but rather the <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> of the Newtonian physicist, which comprises Wiener's original scientific tradition.</p>
<p>There are other significant insights in Wiener's classic book. He gives five principles that should, in his opinion, govern the design of computing machinery; a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> should </p>
<ul>
<li>be <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>, </li>
<li>be <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> rather than electromechanical, </li>
<li>use <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a> rather than decimal notation, </li>
<li>be programmable, contain a dynamic (erasable) <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">random access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wiener says in his Introduction that he had written a letter to Vannevar Bush in 1940 suggesting these principles and commenting on their importance to <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> requirements. Bush, being firmly in the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> camp, apparently did not respond.</p>
<p>Wiener proposed using computing machinery to provide effective prostheses for the sensory impaired. By converting visual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into an appropriate auditory modality for the blind, or alternatively converting auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into a visual display for the deaf, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> could help overcome the primary handicap associated with these disabilities. It would be several decades before computers would begin to master these tasks. Wiener ends the 1948 version of <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> with a description of a recursive strategy for building a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> chess <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. He predicts that such a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> would be capable of playing at a level that would be "not so manifestly bad as to be ridiculous."</p>
<p>A theme that is echoed throughout this book, as well as in other writings of Wiener's, is the need for collaboration among multiple disciplines if the difficult challenge of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s mastering cognitive problems is to be addressed. He articulates a need to reverse the trend toward increasingly narrow specialization in the sciences and predicts that solving the major <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> problems of the second half of the twentieth century would require <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and expertise to be drawn and integrated from diverse disciplines. The greatest difficulty in achieving this type of cooperation, Wiener feels, is the fact that experts from different fields all use different terminologies often to describe the same phenomena. Though Wiener's prediction was largely overlooked for decades, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> researchers just now seem to be coming to the realization that further <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in creating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> requires exactly this sort of interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><h2>The movement takes shape</h2><p>The 1940s saw the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> programmable <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, major developments in computational theory, and the emergence of the idea that with the right <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> these new machines could simulate the human brain.<sup>46</sup> After all, in some ways the new machines were substantially superior to human cognition, solving in minutes what mere human mathematicians labored on for months. With several important treatises by Turing (including his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>," in which Turing proposes his imitation game, which became known as the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>), Wiener's <i>Cybernetics</i>, a 1943 paper on neural nets by Warren McCulloch and Warren Pitts, a proposal by Shannon in 1950 for a chess <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, and several other influential papers, the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> agenda had been set.<sup>47</sup>
</p>
<p>In the 1950s concrete <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> began to be made. Initial <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> came so rapidly that some of the early pioneers felt that mastering the functionality of the human brain might not be so difficult after all. After developing IPL-II (<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Processing <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a> II), the first <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, in 1955, Allen Newell, J. <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Shaw, and Herbert Simon created a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> in 1956 called the <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> Theorist (LT), which used recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> techniques to solve problems in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>.<sup>48</sup> It was able to find proofs for many of the theorems in Whitehead and Russell's <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, including at least one completely original proof for an important theorem that had     never been previously published.<sup>49</sup> In 1957 Newell, Shaw, and Simon created a more sophisticated problem solver called the General Problem Solver (<a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a>).<sup>50</sup> As described earlier, it used means-ends analysis, a variation of LT's recursive technique, to solve problems in a variety of domains. These early successes led Simon and Newell to say in a 1958 paper entitled "<a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">Heuristic</a> Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>," "There are now in the world machines that think, that learn and that create. Moreover, their ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until-in a visible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>-the range of problems they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied."<sup>51</sup> The paper goes on to predict that within ten years (that is, by 1968) a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will be the world chess champion. Such unbridled enthusiasm was to earn the field considerable criticism and critics.<sup>52</sup> While the chess prediction turned out to be premature, a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> completed in 1959 by Arthur Samuel was able to defeat some of the best players of the time in the somewhat simpler game of checkers.<sup>53</sup>
</p>
<p>In 1956 the first conference on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> was held. Organized by <a class="thought" href="entries/mccarthy_entry.html">John McCarthy</a>, it included a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of the field's <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> academic leaders, including <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> and Arthur Samuel, as well as Newell and Simon. Also participating were several <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> pioneers, including Oliver Selfridge, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester.<sup>54</sup> The conference gained its notoriety from its one identifiable accomplishment, which was to give the field its name, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. McCarthy, who is credited with the name, is not sure if he really made it up or just overheard it in a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>, but he does take credit for having promoted it. Some participants argued against the name: Shannon felt it was too unscientific; Samuel criticized the     word "artificial" with the comment "it sounds like there is nothing real about this work." Perhaps just because the phrase is so startling and unsettling, it has outlasted many others, including Wiener's "<a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">cybernetics</a>."<sup>55</sup>

<span class="Caption">Patrick Winston, director of MIT's <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Lab. His <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> involves work on <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> problem solving.</span>
<br>Other concrete accomplishments of the conference are hard to discern, although Minsky did write a first draft of his influential "Steps toward <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>," which was rewritten many times (as is Minsky's style) and finally published in 1963.<sup>56</sup> McCarthy refined his ideas for a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that would combine list (treelike) structures with <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a>, which was subsequently introduced in 1959 as <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">LISP</a> (List-processing <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>).<sup>57</sup> It quickly became the standard for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work and has remained the principal <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> through several major revisions. Only recently with <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> having entered the <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> arena have other languages such as <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> begun to compete with <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">LISP</a>, primarily on the basis of efficiency. Probably the major contribution of the conference was to put a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of the leading thinkers in the field in touch with one another. <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a>, ideas, and a great deal of enthusiasm were shared, although McCarthy left the conference disappointed that most of its specific goals had not been met. He went on to found the two leading university <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> laboratories: one at MIT with <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> in 1958 and one at Stanford in 1963.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1960s the full <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> agenda was represented by specific projects. A <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of the more significant efforts of the decade are described in <i>Semantic </i><i>Information</i><i> Processing</i>, edited by <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a> and published in 1968. Included was Daniel G. Bobrow's Ph.D. project entitled Student, which could set up and solve <a class="thought" href="entries/algebra_entry.html">algebra</a> problems from natural English <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> stories.<sup>58</sup> Student reportedly rivaled the ability of typical high school students in solving story problems. The same performance level was claimed for a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> created by Thomas G. Evans that could solve <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> test geometric-<a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> problems.<sup>59</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> chess programs continued to improve in the 1960s, although not nearly up to Simon's expectations. A <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that could achieve respectable tournament ratings was created in 1966 by Richard D. Greenblatt at MIT.<sup>60</sup>
</p>
<p>A new area for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, expert systems, also got its start in the 1960s. With leadership from Edward A. Feigenbaum, now the director of the Stanford <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> Laboratory, a group started work on <a class="thought" href="entries/dendral_entry.html">DENDRAL</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> based on a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> describing chemical compounds. It is considered the world's first <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>.<sup>61</sup>
</p>
<p>The 1960s also saw the creation of <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> written by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966, which simulates a nondirective (i.e., Rogerian) therapist. <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> has continued for over two decades to receive a high level of attention, including extensive criticism for its inability to react intelligently in a variety of situations, from some <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> critics, most notably Hubert Dreyfus.<sup>62</sup> Actually, <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> was never representative of the state of the art in natural-<a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> understanding, even at the time it was created. It was a demonstration of how successful one could be in creating an <i>apparently</i> intelligent interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with relatively simple rules. <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> is a good example of the principle of achieving complex behavior from a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in a complex environment. People using <a class="thought" href="entries/eliza_entry.html">ELIZA</a> provide it with very diverse inputs, which often lead to unexpected and seemingly insightful responses despite its relative simplicity. A more substantial effort in the area of <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> was Susumu Kuno's pioneering work on English <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> parsers: his 1963 <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> could understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> of complex English sentences.</p>
<p>Another <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> characteristic of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work in the 1960s was the use of toy worlds. A prime example was Terry Winograd's Ph.D. thesis at MIT called <a class="thought" href="entries/shrdlu_entry.html">SHRDLU</a>, which combined <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding with a planning capability in a simulated world (displayed on a terminal screen) that consisted only of different colored and shaped blocks.<sup>63</sup> Users could ask <a class="thought" href="entries/shrdlu_entry.html">SHRDLU</a> to perform tasks with questions and commands phrased in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>, such as "Take the red block in front of the big cube and place it on the blue rectangular solid." The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> would understand the English statements and could plan a strategy for performing the task. Although several critics of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> jumped on the unrealistic <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of these toy worlds, it was appropriate at the time to concentrate on problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> understanding and decision making without the vagaries of real-world <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.<sup>64</sup> The next step, going from toy worlds to real worlds, continues to occupy the attention of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> researchers.</p><h3>Daniel Bobrow's Student solves <a class="thought" href="entries/algebra_entry.html">algebra</a> story problems.

<p></p><h2>The age of <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a></h2><p>Through the end of the 1960s two schools of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> competed for the attention of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> researchers and funding. The neural school, based on self-organizing neural nets, started in the 1940s with a paper by McCulloch and Pitts and was heavily promoted in the 1960s by Frank Rosenblatt of Cornell University.<sup>65</sup> The lure of neural nets is the idea that a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of many simple elements, if set up in just the right way, could actually teach (organize) itself to perform intelligent behavior. With the publication of Minsky and Papert's <i>Perceptrons</i> in 1969, this school of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> was eliminated almost overnight. As mentioned earlier, the book proved several theorems that demonstrated that certain types of simple problems could never be solved with this approach. Now in the late 1980s there is renewed interest in a new type of neural net to which the Minsky and Papert theorems do not apply.<sup>66</sup>
</p>
<p>The school that survived, which one might call the recursive school, was based on the idea that a relatively small set of powerful ideas would be sufficient to capture at least some forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. If one let these methods attack complicated problems, one could obtain intelligent behavior. The ideas included methods of exploring (searching) the "space" of possible solutions to a problem as well as techniques for defining the rules that govern certain domains (e.g. the <a class="thought" href="entries/syntax_entry.html">syntax</a> rules of <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>).</p>
<p>Foremost among these "powerful" ideas is <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a>, the idea that the statement of a problem can be used as a part, often the most important part, of the problem's solution. It is a seductive <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>; it implies that the essence of solving a problem is often a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of being able carefully and precisely to state the problem. This approach works surprisingly well in a variety of domains, and many <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> methodologies make extensive use of it. It is one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that the von Neumann <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> that was first incorporated in the famous <a class="thought" href="entries/edsac_entry.html">EDSAC</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/binac_entry.html">BINAC</a> computers was so important. Without the von Neumann capability for a <a class="thought" href="entries/stored_program_entry.html">stored program</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> is not possible.</p>
<p>We examined one illustration of the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> earlier in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of game playing. To select our best move in a rule-based game such as chess we call a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> called Move. Move generates all of the legal moves for the current board position and then calls itself to determine the opponent's best response, to each possible move (which in turn calls itself again to determine our best response to our opponent's best response, and so on). In this way as many move and countermove sequences as we have time to compute are automatically generated. The most complicated part of implementing this technique is the generation of the possible moves. Generating possible moves is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of programming the rules of the game. Thus, the heart of the solution is indeed implementing a precise statement of the problem.</p>
<p>A primary distinguishing feature of McCarthy's <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">LISP</a>, historically the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> field's primary programming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, is its ability to easily represent recursive procedures. Another example should illustrate how easily a recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> can be used to solve seemingly complex problems. Consider the problem called the Tower of Hanoi. This famous children's puzzle presents issues similar to many important combinatorial problems found in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and other fields.</p>
<p>We have three towers on which we can place round disks of various sizes. We can move disks from tower to tower, but we can only move one disk at a time and we cannot place a disk onto a disk of smaller size. Thus, a legal stack of disks will have the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest disk on top. The problem is to move a stack of disks from one tower to another. Consider first a stack of just one disk. Here the answer is obvious: simply move the disk. It is also fairly easy to determine the procedure for two disks. Let's consider a larger stack. Try actually solving the problem for a stack of seven or eight disks-it is rather challenging.</p>
<p>Now consider the general problem of describing a <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> that can quickly determine the <i>optimal</i> procedure for a stack of <i>any</i> arbitrary height. This problem at first appears very difficult, but a simple insight enables us to use the self-referencing (recursive) <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to automatically generate the optimal procedure for any height stack in three simple steps. Let us <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> the disks from 1 to <i>n</i>, <i>n</i> being the largest (bottom) disk. The insight is this: if we are to move the entire stack from the original tower to the destination tower, at some point we are going to have to move the bottom disk. That's it! We have just solved the problem. The power of <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> is that this simple observation is enough to solve the entire problem.</p>
<p>To wit, if the stack consists of only a single disk, then move that disk from the original tower to the destination tower, and we're done. Otherwise,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Step 1</i>  Since we know that we will need at some point to move the bottom disk, we clearly need to move the disks on top of it out of the way. We therefore have to move them away from both the original tower and the destination tower. Thus, we have to move the stack consisting of all the disks <i>except</i> for the bottom disk (we can call this the (<i>n</i> - 1) stack since it consists of disk 1 through disk <i>n</i> - 1) from the original tower to the free tower. This is where the <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> comes in. Moving the stack of (<i>n</i> - 1) disks is the same Tower of Hanoi problem that we started with, only for a smaller stack. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> solving the Tower of Hanoi problem simply calls itself at this point to solve the problem of moving the (<i>n</i> - 1) stack to the free tower. This does not lead to an infinite loop because of our special rule for a stack of only one disk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Step 2</i>  Now with all of the other disks out of the way, we can move the bottom disk from the original tower to the destination tower.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Step 3</i>  Finally, we move the stack of (<i>n</i> - 1) disks from the free tower to the destination tower. This again requires a recursive call. Now we're done.</li>
</ul>
<p>The power of recursive programming languages is that a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> can call itself with the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> keeping track of all the tightly nested self-referencing. The above three steps will not only solve the problem, it will produce the optimal solution to the problem for any height stack. It generates exactly (2<sup>n</sup>- 1) moves for <i>n</i> disks. If one attempts to solve the problem directly by moving disks, one quickly gets lost in the apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of the puzzle. To solve the problem using <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a>, all that is required is enough insight to be able to state how the solution for <i>n</i> disks can be built from the solution for (<i>n</i> - 1) disks. <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">Recursion</a> then optimally expands the solution for any value of <i>n</i>.</p>
<p>As the above example should make clear, <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> is a tool that can unlock solutions to problems that otherwise would be enormously difficult to understand. A variety of techniques based on this self-referencing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> found widespread applicability by the 1960s. The initial success of recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> techniques-finding, for example, an <i>original proof</i> for an important theorem in <i>Principia Mathematica</i>-fueled much of the field's early <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a>.</p><h2>A recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for the Tower of Hanoi problem</h2><p>The following <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, written in the <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> programming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, generates an optimal solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.

<p>Some work on <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">knowledge representation</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about how to represent <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>) took place earlier.<sup>69</sup> In fact, two projects conducted during the 1960s and described in Minsky's <i>Semantic </i><i>Information</i><i> Processing</i> were Bertram Raphael's SIR <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> (Semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Retrieval) and a theory of semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> by M. Ross Quillian, both of which dealt with methods for representing human <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. What changed in the early 1970s was the recognition of the relative importance of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> versus <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>. In the 1950s and 1960s there was an emphasis on the power of techniques, particularly recursive ones, for emulating the logical processes associated with <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. By the 1970s it was recognized that programming reasoning techniques were relatively simple compared to the task of creating a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> with the depth required to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/schank_entry.html">Roger Schank</a> points out the extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> required to understand even simple stories. If we read a story about a restaurant, there is a vast body of factual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about restaurants that we take for granted.<sup>70</sup> Understanding the statement "He paid the bill" requires understanding that in a restaurant we are expected to pay for the food we order, we order food on credit, we are brought a document (generally at the end of the meal) called the "tab," "check," or "bill," which itemizes the charges, we generally settle this debt prior to leaving the restaurant, and so on. When we read a story, almost every sentence evokes vast networks of similarly implied <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. The difficulty in mastering all of this commonsense <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is that no one has ever bothered to write it all down, and the quantity of it is vast.</p>
<p>Mastering <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> has indeed turned out to be a far more difficult process than mastering the logical processes inherent in deductive or even inductive reasoning. First, we need to have a means of structuring <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to make it useful. A simple list of all facts in the world, if such a list could be constructed, would not help us solve problems, because we would have a hard time finding the right facts to fit the right situations. <a class="thought" href="entries/hofstadter_entry.html">Douglas Hofstadter</a> provides an amusing example of the problem in <i>Metamagical Themas</i>. "How do I know," he asks, "when telling you I'll meet you at 7 at the train station, that it makes no sense to tack on the proviso, 'as long as no volcano erupts along the way, burying me and my car on the way to the station,' but that it does make reasonable sense to tack on the proviso, 'as long as no traffic jam holds me up?"' The objective of appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> structures is to quickly <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> truly relevant to any particular situation. Once we have constructed suitable structures for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">knowledge representation</a>, we then need to actually collect the vast amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> required to solve practical problems. Finally, we have to integrate this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> with the appropriate decision-making algorithms.</p>
<p>The early 1970s saw a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of pioneering efforts to address the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-representation problem. Perhaps the most famous was Minsky's theory of <i>frames</i>, which he described in his 1975 paper "A Framework for Representing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a>."<sup>71</sup> A frame is a data <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> that can include <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> of arbitrary <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> about an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> or type of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, and that allows for multiple hierarchies for understanding relationships between classes of objects. For example, we can have a frame of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a dog, another for the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a cat, and another for the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a> frame is a higher-level frame than those representing <i>examples</i> of mammals, and the relationship between the levels (e.g., a dog is a type of <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>) is built into the frame structures. Each frame allows for default <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to be filled in or "inherited" from a higher-level frame. For example, if the <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a> frame says that mammals have four legs, this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> would not have to be repeated in the frames for dogs and cats. However, a <i>human</i> frame would have to indicate an exception to this default <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (one specifying only two legs). The frame methodology avoids redundancy, describes hierarchical relationships, and allows for arbitrarily complex classifications. It also helps us to make useful hypotheses. If we learn, for example, about another <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>, we can assume that it has four legs until informed otherwise.</p>
<p>Another important approach to representing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and the interdependency relationships between concepts was first described in another 1975 paper, this one describing a project called SAM (Script Applier Mechanism) by <a class="thought" href="entries/schank_entry.html">Roger Schank</a>, Robert Abelson, et al. at Yale University. Schank's methodology allowed for the development of "scripts" that provide the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> implicit in everyday situations such as restaurants.<sup>72</sup>
</p>
<p>The second part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> issue, actually collecting the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, has proved to be the greatest challenge. In developing modern expert systems (<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based systems that emulate the decision-making ability of human experts), the process of collecting the necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is generally a painstaking process involving a "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> engineer" interviewing the appropriate human experts and literally writing down (in an appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_language_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>) all of the relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and decision-making rules used by that human expert. The sheer volume of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> involved is one problem, but a bigger one is that while human experts are capable of solving problems within their domains of expertise, they generally do not know <i>how</i> they accomplish these tasks. The skill required of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> engineer is to be able to extract the decision-making process from the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> experts despite their not being consciously aware of many elements of this process.<sup>73</sup>
</p>
<p>With a first generation methodology for building expert systems already established, a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of ambitious projects were started in the 1970s. Internist (now called CADUCEUS), an <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> that diagnoses a wide range of internal diseases, was developed throughout the 1970s (and continued in the 1980s). In one study, Internist was able to diagnose illnesses within at least one specialty with an accuracy equal to or better than human physicians. <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can make diagnoses and recommend treatments for a wide range of bacterial infections, was developed by Edward H. Shortliffe in the mid 1970s. <a class="thought" href="entries/prospector_entry.html">Prospector</a>, an <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> that is capable of pinpointing <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and geology deposits, was initiated by R.O. Duda and his associates at <a class="thought" href="entries/sri_entry.html">Stanford Research Institute</a> in 1978. In at least one case <a class="thought" href="entries/prospector_entry.html">Prospector</a> identified a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of important <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> deposits overlooked by human experts. Finally, <a class="thought" href="entries/xcon_entry.html">XCON</a>, probably the most successful <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> use today, started <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> in 1980 configuring complex <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> systems for <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Equipment Corporation. This <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, running on a single VAX <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, is able to perform tasks that would otherwise require several hundred human experts, and at substantially higher rates of accuracy. These systems and others, as well as the problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">knowledge representation</a>, will be discussed in greater detail in chapter 8.<sup>74</sup>

<p>The U.S. Department of Defense through its agency <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> (Defense Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects Agency), funded two major initiatives in the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> area during the 1970s.

<p>The intensity of effort as well as the practical value of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> grew enormously during the 1980s. Here I shall mention briefly two <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> trends: the commercialization and the internationalization of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> industry grew from just a few million dollars at the beginning of the 1980s to $2 billion by 1988, according to DM <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a>, a leading market-<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> firm. Many market analysts predict that the bulk of the several-hundred-billion dollar <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing market by 1999 will be intelligent, at least by today's standards.</p>
<p>The 1980s began with a stunning challenge from Japan's powerful MITI (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry) when they announced a plan to design and build an intelligent fifth generation <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. This was seen by many as an attempt by Japan to leapfrog its foreign competitors and establish dominance over the international <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry.<sup>75</sup>
</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the idea that human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> could be simulated seems to have occurred to all of the pioneers who played a role in what I consider to be the twentieth century's greatest <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Though <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> was not named until 1956, the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> was by no means an afterthought. Despite the fact that the early computers were used primarily for numerical calculation (as most computers still are today), these classic machines were not <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of by their creators as mere <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> crunchers. They have been viewed since their conception as amplifiers of human <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, what Ed Feigenbaum calls "power tools for the mind."<sup>76</sup>
</p>
<p>Early success in the 1950s and 1960s with what were <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to be difficult problems, such as proving theorems and playing chess, fueled a romantic <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> that proved short-lived. It was an example of the "90-10" rule: solving the first 90 percent of a problem often requires only 10 percent of the effort, and though the remaining 10 percent then requires 90 percent of the effort, it generally represents 90 percent of the importance. With the realization in the 1970s that extensive <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> was required to solve practical problems, and with no easy way of capturing that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, the field gained a needed maturity.</p>
<p>The 1980s saw the first practical solutions to real problems and the emergence of a multibillion-dollar industry. The 1990s will, in my estimation, witness the emergence of an industry valued at several hundred billion dollars and a generation of ubiquitous intelligent machines that work intimately with their human creators.</p>
