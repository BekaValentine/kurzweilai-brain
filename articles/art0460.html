<div class="TeaserText">Nanorobotic artificial mechanical platelets ("clottocytes") may allow for complete hemostasis in as little as one second &#8211; 100 to 1000 times faster than the natural system and 10,000 times more effective in terms of bloodstream concentration. They could also work internally. Using acoustic pulses, a blood vessel break could be rapidly communicated to neighboring clottocytes, immediately triggering a progressive controlled mesh-release cascade.</div>

<p>People often ask for examples of the unique benefits that nanorobots 
              can bring to <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. That is, what sorts of simple things will 
              robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a> allow us to do, that an advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> 
              could not accomplish, even in principle? The respirocytes [1] - 
              artificial mechanical red blood cells - are one answer to this perennial 
              question. Respirocytes are micron-sized diamondoid storage tanks 
              for transporting respiratory gases throughout the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body that 
              can be reversibly pressurized up to 1000 atm in direct response 
              to changing tissue requirements. Here, I'd like to describe another 
              interesting example of a simple nanorobotic application that could 
              provide a unique superbiological capability: "instant" 
              hemostasis using clottocytes, or artificial mechanical platelets. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and primary functions of the platelet are well known. 
              In brief, platelets are roughly spheroidal <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>-free blood cells 
              measuring ~2 microns in diameter with an average bloodstream lifetime 
              of ~10 days [2] and a mean blood concentration of ~250,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> 
              [3]. Platelets gather at a site of bleeding. There they are activated, 
              becoming sticky and clumping together to form a plug that helps 
              seal the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, they 
              release substances that help promote clotting. Natural blood coagulation 
              is a complex process involving platelets, red and white cells, endothelial 
              cells, an array of coagulation factors, fibrinolytic <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s and 
              protease inhibitors whose contributions wax and wane over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. 
              Interestingly, it has been found that platelets can slowly crawl 
              across surfaces [4], and they have other well-studied ancillary 
              abilities such as the phagocytosis of foreign <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s [5] and 
              the killing of microfilarial larval parasites [6]. <br>
</p>
<p>A complete functional design of an artificial platelet is beyond 
              the scope of this paper. Here, I want to focus on the purely mechanical 
              aspects of the hemostatic function of platelets, and describe how 
              this function might be served more effectively by a small <i>in 
              vivo</i> population of medical nanorobotic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. <br>
</p>
<p>After injury to a blood vessel, a natural hemostatic plug is formed 
              which is composed predominantly of platelets. Platelet activation 
              - primary hemostasis - normally proceeds in three phases [13]. The 
              first phase is platelet adhesion, in which a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> monolayer carpet 
              forms in response to the exposure of an appropriate surface to the 
              blood. The relevant natural surface in vivo is <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to be the 
              subendothelial <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>. This <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> lies just below the endothelial 
              cells that coat the blood vessels and would become exposed if a 
              vessel was injured. Artificial surfaces can also induce adhesion. 
              The second phase is platelet aggregation into a plug, mediated by 
              the interaction of fibrinogen with glycoprotein receptors on the 
              platelet surface (the gpIIb/IIIa complex) in the presence of micromolar 
              concentrations of calcium. The third phase is platelet secretion, 
              in which platelet granules release their <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s into the extracellular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. These <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s include adenosine diphosphate (ADP), Ca<sup>++</sup>, 
              and various <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s such as platelet factor 4 and thromboglobulin 
              that contribute to the formation of a stable plug, along with other 
              agents such as <a class="thought" href="entries/serotonin_entry.html">serotonin</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/epinephrine_entry.html">epinephrine</a>, which cause vasoconstriction. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>Secondary hemostasis then ensues with the deposition of fibrin. 
              Fibrin strands quickly form a fine meshwork of random fibrils, trapping 
              more platelets and other blood cells to produce a solid clot. Total 
              bleeding <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, as <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ally measured from initial <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of injury 
              to cessation of blood flow, may range from 2-5 minutes [7-9] up 
              to 9-10 minutes [10, 13] if even small doses of aspirin are present, 
              with 2-8 minutes being typical in clinical practice; minor prolongations 
              up to 15-20 minutes are not considered clinically risky [11-13], 
              and medical dictionaries [14] give the normal coagulation <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as 
              6-17 minutes (360-1020 sec). (Bleeding times begin to be prolonged 
              in otherwise normal patients when their platelet count falls below 
              ~50,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> [12], ~20% of the normal concentration.) Over 
              the next several hours, the fibrils slowly diffuse within the clot, 
              much as spaghetti moves in boiling water, forming unstable side-to-side 
              monomer associations and thereafter thick bundles, until finally 
              they become cross linked with covalent disulfide bonds by factor 
              XIIIa, making a dense clot. Note that bleeding <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is a measure 
              only of clotting due to platelet function and does not account well 
              for the effect of fibrin (the actual coagulant cascade). <br>
</p>
<p>By contrast, the artificial mechanical platelet or clottocyte may 
              allow complete hemostasis in as little as ~1 second, even in moderately 
              large wounds. This response <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 100-1000 times 
              faster than the natural <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Our baseline clottocyte is conceived 
              as a serum oxyglucose-powered spherical nanorobot ~2 microns in 
              diameter (~4 micron3 volume) containing a fiber mesh that is compactly 
              folded onboard. Upon command from its control <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> 
              promptly unfurls its mesh <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a> in the immediate vicinity of an 
              injured blood vessel - following, say, a cut through the skin. Soluble 
              thin films coating certain parts of the mesh dissolve upon contact 
              with plasma water, revealing sticky sections (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/complementary_entry.html">complementary</a> 
              to blood group antigens unique to red <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> surfaces) in desired 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. Blood cells are immediately trapped in the overlapping 
              artificial nettings released by multiple neighboring activated clottocytes, 
              and bleeding halts at once. <br>
</p>
<p>How much netting can each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> clottocyte carry? The required 
              fiber volume of a mesh that covers an area A<sub>net</sub> using 
              fibers of working strength sigma<sub>fiber</sub> and thickness t<sub>fiber</sub> 
              with a grid size of l<sub>mesh</sub> is V<sub>mesh</sub>=2(A<sub>net</sub><sup>1/2</sup>+A<sub>net</sub>/l<sub>mesh</sub>) 
              t<sub>fiber</sub><sup>2</sup>. Minimum fiber thickness is t<sub>fiber</sub> 
              &gt;~ (p<sub>blood</sub>l<sub>mesh</sub><sup>2</sup>/4 sigma<sub>fiber</sub>)<sup>(1/2)</sup>, 
              where the maximum blood pressure that may be resisted by the netting 
              is p<sub>blood</sub> ~ 0.25 atm (190 mmHg). Taking l<sub>mesh</sub> 
              ~1 micron and sigma<sub>fiber</sub> ~10<sup>10</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> 
              for diamondoid fibers, t<sub>fiber</sub> &gt;~0.8 nm and V<sub>mesh</sub> 
              ~0.1 micron<sup>3</sup> (taking up 3% of <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> volume) for a net 
              of area A<sub>net</sub> = 0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>. If instead of the 
              strongest diamondoid fibers we use bioresorbable organic fibers 
              for the netting -- having, say, roughly the strength of cellulose 
              or spider silk (sigma<sub>fiber</sub> ~10<sup>9</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> 
              [3]) -- then the fibers must be 2.5 nm thick and mesh volume becomes 
              1.3 micron<sup>3</sup> (occupying 30% of nanodevice volume) to throw out a 
              0.1 mm<sup>2</sup> net. Stokes law drag power [3] on the net during its 1 
              second unfurlment <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is a fairly modest ~100 pW per nanorobot, 
              assuming whole-blood viscosity at the normal ~45% hematocrit (Hct). 
              <br>
</p>
<p>How many clottocytes are needed to stop bleeding in ~1 second? 
              The required blood concentration n<sub>bot</sub> of nanorobots required to 
              stop capillary flow at <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> v<sub>cap</sub> in a response <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> t<sub>stop</sub>, assuming 
              n<sub>overlap</sub> fully overlapped nets, is n<sub>bot</sub> ~n<sub>overlap</sub>/(A<sub>net</sub>t<sub>stop</sub>v<sub>cap</sub>). 
              Taking n<sub>overlap</sub>=2, A<sub>net</sub>=0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>, t<sub>stop</sub>=1 sec, and v<sub>cap</sub> ~1 mm/sec 
              [3] gives n<sub>bot</sub>=20 mm<sup>-3</sup>, or just ~110 million clottocytes in the 
              entire 5.4-liter <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body blood volume representing ~11 m<sup>2</sup> of 
              total deployable mesh surface. This total dose is ~0.4 mm<sup>3</sup> of clottocytes, 
              which produces a negligible serum nanocrit [3] of Nct ~ 0.00001%. 
              During the 1 second hemostasis <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, an incision wound measuring 
              1 cm long and 3 mm deep would lose only ~6 mm<sup>3</sup> of blood, less than 
              one-tenth of a single droplet. There are 2-3 red cells per deployed 
              1 micron<sup>2</sup> mesh square, more than enough to ensure that the meshwork 
              will be completely filled, allowing complete blockage of a breach. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>Special control protocols are needed to guarantee that clottocytes 
              don't release their mesh <a class="thought" href="entries/packet_entry.html">packet</a>s in the wrong place inside the body, 
              or at an inappropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. These protocols will demand that carefully 
              specified constellations of sensor readings must be observed before 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> activation is permitted. <br>
</p>
<p>For example, the atmospheric concentrations of gases such as <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> 
              dioxide and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> are different than in blood serum. As clottocyte-rich 
              blood enters a breach in a blood vessel, nanorobot onboard sensors 
              can rapidly detect the change in partial pressures, indicating that 
              the nanodevice is being bled out of the body. At a nanorobot whole-blood 
              concentration of 20 mm<sup>-3</sup>, mean <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> separation is 370 microns. 
              If the first <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> to be bled from the body lies 75 microns from 
              the air-serum <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from the air can diffuse 
              through serum at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body temperature (310 K) from the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> 
              to the nanodevice surface in ~1 second [3]. Detection of this change 
              can be rapidly <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a> to neighboring clottocytes using acoustic 
              pulses that are received in times on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of microseconds, 
              allowing rapid propagation of a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>-enablement cascade. Similarly, 
              air temperature is normally lower than body temperature. The thermal 
              equilibration <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> [3] across a distance L in serum at 310 K is 
              t<sub>EQ</sub> ~(6.7 x 10<sup>6</sup>) L<sup>2</sup>, hence a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that lies 75 microns from 
              the air-plasma <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> can detect a change in temperature in t<sub>EQ</sub> 
              ~ 40 millisec. Other relevant sensor readings may include blood 
              pressure profiles, bioacoustic monitoring, bioelectrical field measurements, 
              optical and ultraviolet radiation detection, and sudden shifts in 
              pH or other ionic concentrations. At some cost in rapidity of response, 
              clottocytes also could eavesdrop [3] on natural <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> platelet 
              control signals, using sensors with receptors for the natural prostaglandins 
              produced by endothelial cells that normally induce or inhibit platelet 
              activation. <br>
</p>
<p>The rapid mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of clottocytes could interfere with 
              the much slower natural platelet adhesion and aggregation processes, 
              or disturb the normal equilibrium between the clotting and fibrinolytic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Thus it may be necessary for artificial platelets to release 
              quantities of various chemical substances that will encourage the 
              remainder of the coagulation cascade to proceed normally or at an 
              accelerated pace, including timed localized vasodilation and vasoconstriction, 
              control of endothelial <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> modulation of natural platelet <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>, 
              and finally clot retraction and fibrinolysis much later during tertiary 
              hemostasis. <br>
</p>
<p>There is a small risk that a potentially-fatal catastrophic clotting 
              cascade called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [18] 
              could be triggered by excessive clottocyte activity. Coagulation 
              is usually confined to a localized area by a combination of bloodflow, 
              localized thrombin production, and circulating coagulation inhibitors 
              such as antithrombin III (a potent thrombin inhibitor). But if the 
              stimulus to coagulation is too great, excess thrombin is produced 
              and enters the general circulation. This overwhelms the natural 
              control mechanisms and leads to excess fibrin deposition, formation 
              of large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of microthrombi (intravascular clotting), rapid 
              depletion of platelets and fibrinogen (and other coagulation factors), 
              secondary fibrinolysis, and often hemorrhage, the typical signs 
              of acute DIC. One solution is to equip clottocytes with sensors 
              to detect decreased serum levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin, 
              antithrombin III, factor VII and <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, and elevated levels 
              of thrombin and various fibrin/fibrinogen-derived degradation products. 
              If DIC conditions arise, nanorobots might respond by absorbing and 
              metabolizing the excess thrombin, or by releasing thrombin inhibitors 
              such as antithrombin III, hirudin, argatroban or lepirudin [19] 
              or anticoagulants that reduce thrombin generation such as danaparoid 
              [19] to interrupt the cascade. For example, a ~0.02% Nct concentration 
              of nanorobots, suitably activated, could replace the entire depleted 
              natural bloodstream <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of antithrombin III from onboard stores. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>Extended bleeding often serves to cleanse a wound of foreign <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> that might have entered the body along with the skin-penetrating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> that caused the wound. By immediately staunching the flow, 
              it might be argued that clottocytes would prevent this natural cleaning 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> from taking place. However, it is anticipated that clottocytes 
              would only be one <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of a complete hematological "upgrade" 
              package, and that other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of circulating nanorobots would 
              perform these scavenging and janitorial tasks. <br>
</p>
<p>Yet another possible complication is that the bare tissue walls 
              of a wound will continue to exude fluid, and may begin to desiccate, 
              if only the capillary termini are sealed but the rest of the tissue 
              is left exposed to open air. Since clottocytes may remain attached 
              to their discharged nets, and can communicate with each other via 
              acoustic channels [3], it should be possible to precisely control 
              the development of a larger artificial mesh-based clot via coordinated 
              mesh extensions or retractions within the clot. Alternatively, clottocytes 
              could allow blood fluids to flood small incised or avulsed wound 
              volumes, allowing exposed tissue walls to be bathed in fluids but 
              casting a watertight sealant net across the wound opening flush 
              with the epidermal plane of the wound cavity. <br>
</p>
<p>What about internal bleeding? Clottocytes will require far more 
              sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>al protocols if they are intended to assist 
              platelets participating in the sealing of internal blood vessel 
              lesions, in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to avoid inadvertently blocking the lumen of the 
              entire vessel. Similarly, prevention of bleeding at vascular anastomoses, 
              hemarthroses, internal bruising, "blood blisters" and 
              larger tissue hematomas, as well as forced local coagulation in 
              tumors or in intracerebral aneurysms, may also require more advanced 
              protocols, possibly including integration with pre-existing <i>in 
              vivo</i> navigation <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s [3]. For some of these applications, 
              motile clottocytes may be required in place of the free-floating 
              nanorobots described in this paper, along with a graduated recruitment 
              response depending upon how many (intercommunicating) <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s appear 
              to be involved in the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>Numerous significant design questions remain, including most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly 
              biocompatibility issues -- are clottocytes truly inert? Will they 
              interact with other blood cells or with endothelial cells? Will 
              they activate complement pathways or elicit fibrin deposition? Diamond 
              is indeed chemically inert [15, 16] and is generally considered 
              noninflammatory relative to the complement <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> [17]. An enveloped 
              clottocyte externally coated with autologous platelet membrane should 
              be nearly as biocompatible as native platelets and could also assist 
              in the recruitment of intrinsic coagulation mechanisms -- especially 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant for severely thrombocytopenic (platelet-poor) patients. 
              Another requirement is that the bioresorbable netting must be capable 
              of being broken up into phagocytosable pieces, either by natural 
              enzymatic pathways or by artificial fiberlytic enzymes (<a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous 
              to fibrinolytic plasmin) that may be released from the clottocyte 
              at the appropriate <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The fiber material should also be nonimmunogenic, 
              to avoid uncontrolled immune-mediated platelet activation [19]. 
              Further analysis must await the completion of Volume II of <i><a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a></i>. 
              <br>
</p>
<p>To summarize: an artificial mechanical platelet appears to permit 
              the halting of bleeding 100-1000 times faster than natural hemostasis. 
              While 1-300 platelets might be broken and still be insufficient 
              to initiate a self-perpetuating clotting cascade, even a single 
              clottocyte, upon reliably detecting a blood vessel break, can rapidly 
              communicate this fact to its neighbors, immediately triggering a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ive controlled mesh-release cascade. Clottocytes may perform 
              a clotting function that is equivalent in its essentials to that 
              performed by <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> platelets -- but at only ~0.01% of the bloodstream 
              concentration of those cells. Hence clottocytes appear to be ~10,000 
              times more effective as clotting agents than an equal volume of 
              natural platelets. <br>
