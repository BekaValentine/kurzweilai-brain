<br><p>Originally published September 9, 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613232116/http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/15/18865?page=1" target="_new">Business2.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>Many long-range forecasts of technical feasibility dramatically underestimate the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> because they are based on what I call the "intuitive linear" view of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> rather than the "<a class="thought" href="entries/historical_exponential_view_entry.html">historical exponential view</a>." It is not the case that we will experience 100 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the 21st century; rather we will witness on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 20,000 years of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> (at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, that is).</p>
<p>Careful consideration of the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> shows that the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is not constant, but it is <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> to simply adapt to the changing pace, so the intuitive view is that the pace will continue at the current rate. Even for those of us who have lived through a sufficiently long period of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> to experience how the pace increases over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, our unexamined <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a> nonetheless provides the impression that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> changes at the rate that we have recently experienced. One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this is that an exponential curve approximates a straight line when viewed for a brief duration. So even though the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the very recent past (i.e., this past year) is far greater than it was 10 years ago (let alone 100 or 1,000 years ago), our memories are nonetheless dominated by our very recent experience. It is typical, therefore, that even sophisticated commentators, when considering the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, extrapolate the current pace of change over the next 10 years or 100 years to determine their expectations. This is why I call this way of looking at the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> the "intuitive linear" view.</p>
<p>But any serious consideration of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> shows that technological change is at least exponential, not linear. There are a great many examples of this, of which the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of computing is just one. One can examine <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on a wide variety of technologies, and on many different <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> scales, and see (at least) double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> described by what I call the "<a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>." This observation does not rely on an assumption of the continuation of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, but is based on a rich model of diverse technological processes. What it clearly shows is that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> advances (at least) exponentially and has been doing so since the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forecasts ignore altogether this "<a class="thought" href="entries/historical_exponential_view_entry.html">historical exponential view</a>" of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and assume instead the "<a class="thought" href="entries/intuitive_linear_view_entry.html">intuitive linear view</a>." That is why people tend to overestimate what can be achieved in the short term (because we tend to leave out necessary details), but underestimate what can be achieved in the long term (because we ignore the fact of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>).This observation also applies to <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> rates, which are currently doubling (approximately) every decade. So, technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the 21st century will be equivalent to what would require (at today's rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>) on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 20,000 years. In terms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of computing, the comparison is even more dramatic.</p>
<p>In considering applying the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> to the genesis of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, I put 49 famous computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s over the past century on an exponential graph. From this exercise, it became apparent that the acceleration of computing power did not start with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> at all, which is an insight regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, but has continued through multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>s (electromechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, relays, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, and finally <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s). <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> was not the first but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in computing. The sixth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, which will involve computing in three dimensions rather than the two manifested in today's flat chips, will lead to computing at the molecular and, ultimately, the subatomic level. We can be confident that the acceleration of computing will survive the well-anticipated demise of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>.</p>
<p>There are comparable <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s underlying a wide variety of other technologies. <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> speeds, both <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>, are doubling every 12 months (this is, again, a double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a> because it was only doubling every 36 months two decades ago). <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">Brain scan</a>ning speeds are doubling every 26 months and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning resolution (per unit volume) is doubling every 12 months. Genetic scanning is doubling every 12 months with <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> sequencing costs having fallen from $12 per base pair to less than 1 cent in the past decade.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">Miniaturization</a> is another pervasive trend: We are currently shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> (both <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> and mechanical) at a rate of 5.6 per linear dimension per decade. The mathematical models I've developed over the past couple of decades to describe these trends resulting from the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> have proven predictive of the developments we've seen during the 1990s. From these models, I believe we can be confident of continued <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in these and other technologies for the foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;It is important to point out that these trends interact with one another in profound ways. We are currently seeing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> manifest themselves in the explosion of <a class="thought" href="entries/handheld_entry.html">handheld</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the Web. As an aside, it is ironic that <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> is being cited for a monopoly in "personal computing" <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> era is coming to a close: The predominant <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> now in computing is in Webservers and <a class="thought" href="entries/handheld_entry.html">handheld</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, neither of which is dominated by <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Because these <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s are not large enough to provide a full keyboard, we will see a strong trend toward communicating with our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s through voice and <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> technologies. Talking is how we prefer to communicate with other people, and the broad trend in computing since its inception has been for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to become more like people, rather than for people to become more like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Over the next several years, a legion of virtual assistants will emerge with sufficient <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to converse in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> within limited task domains, such as conducting ecommerce transactions, making reservations, and finding <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. When a display is available, even a small one, these virtual personalities will have a humanlike visual presence; without a display, they will work entirely using two-way voice dialogues. </p>
<p>By 2009, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will disappear. Visual <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> will be written directly onto our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s by <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s in our eyeglasses and contact lenses. In addition to high resolution virtual monitors appearing to hover in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, these intimate displays will provide full-immersion visual <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>. We will have ubiquitous very high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connection to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> at all times. "Going to a Website" will mean entering a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environment--at least for the visual and auditory senses--where we will meet other real people. There will be simulated people as well, but these virtual personalities will not be up to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> standards, at least not by 2009. The minuscule <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s powering these developments will be invisibly embedded in our glasses and clothing. Thus we won't be <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for our misplaced mobile phones, Palms, notebooks, and other gadgets. And we won't have to deal with the mess of wires that now entangle our lives. We will be plugged in all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and able to have any type of interaction with anyone regardless of physical proximity. </p>
<p>&#160;Any sort of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, that is, except for touching. Tactile <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s are already emerging, but will remain cumbersome until <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> enters our bodies and brains. By 2029, as a result of continuing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, and neural scanning, we will have billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s--intelligent robots the size of blood cells or smaller--traveling through the capillaries of our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> communicating directly with our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. </p>
<p>&#160;Nanobot <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will provide fully immersive, totally convincing <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> in the following way. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s take up positions close to every interneuronal connection coming from all of our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> sensory receptors (e.g., eyes, ears, skin). We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to communicate with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in both directions that requires no direct physical contact with the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. For example, scientists at the <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> Institute in Heidelberg, Germany, have developed "<a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s" that can detect the firing of a nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>, or alternatively, can cause a nearby <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> to fire or suppress it from firing. This amounts to two-way <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> between <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. The institute's scientists demonstrated their <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> by controlling the movement of a living leech from their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;When we want to experience nonvirtual reality, the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will just stay still (in the capillaries) and do nothing. If we want to enter <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, they will suppress all input coming from the real senses, and replace them with the signals that would be appropriate for the virtual environment. You (i.e., your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>) could decide to cause your muscles and limbs to move as you normally would, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s again intercept these interneuronal signals, suppress your real limbs from moving, and instead cause your virtual limbs to move and provide the appropriate movement and reorientation in the virtual environment. Of course, your <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_body_entry.html">virtual body</a> will not need to have the same appearance and other characteristics that it has in real reality--we could have different bodies for different partners and situations.</p>
<p>The Web will provide a panoply of virtual environments to explore. Some will be recreations of real places, others will be fanciful environments that have no "real" counterpart. Some would be impossible in the physical world (perhaps, because they violate the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>). We will be able to "go" to these virtual environments by ourselves or we will meet others there, both real people and simulations. Of course, ultimately, there won't be a clear distinction between the two.</p>
<p>Just as Webcams showing people's intimate lives are popular today, during the fourth decade of this century, people will "Web beam" their lives, and you will be able to share the full sensory experience and even <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al response of others through the Web, similar to the plot concept of the movie Being John Malkovich, except that these experiences can include <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al levels beyond just the five senses. Particularly interesting experiences will be archived and can be relived at any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>&#160;Nanobot <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be able to expand our minds in almost any imaginable way. Our brains today are relatively fixed in design. Although we do add patterns of interneuronal connections and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentrations as a normal part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process, the current overall capacity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is highly constrained, restricted to a mere 100 trillion connections. <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">Brain</a> implants based on massively distributed intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s will vastly expand our memories and otherwise improve all of our sensory, <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, and cognitive abilities. Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s are communicating with one another over a <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/lan_entry.html">local area network</a>, they can create any <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of new neural connections, can break existing connections (by suppressing neural firing), and can create new hybrid <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, as well as adding vast new <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. </p>
<p>&#160;Using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s as <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> extenders is a significant improvement over the idea of surgically installed <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s, which are beginning to be used today (for people with disabilities and medical conditions such as deafness and <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's disease</a>). <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">Nanobot</a>s will be introduced without surgery; they will be injected or swallowed. People will have the power to direct them to leave, so the process will be easily reversible. The bots would be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable, in that they could provide <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> one minute, and a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> extensions the next. They could change their <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>, and alter their <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Perhaps most importantly, unlike surgically introduced <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s that can only be placed in one or at most a few locations, these <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based implants will be massively distributed and therefore can take up billions or trillions of positions throughout the body. </p>
<p>&#160;Oh, and one more thing: We'll live a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. The expanding <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span is another one of those <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s. In the 18th century, we added a few days every year to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> longevity; in the 19th we added a couple of weeks each year; and now we're adding almost a half a year every year. With the revolutions in rational drug design, <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a>, therapeutic cloning of our own organs and tissues, and related developments in bio-<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s, we will add more than a year every year within 10 years. So take care of yourself the old-fashioned way for just a little while longer, and you may actually get to experience the remarkable century ahead.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Mr Kurzweil. Well My name is Ivan and I am a thinker. Well I always think about life and as to who we are or will become. I was just wondering if i could send you an e-mail of what i think is going to become of computers and technology one of these days. I was playing a video game one day and I realized something. We are creating our own world with machines. Although they are virtual world ans they are at their primal state it seems to me that in the future we will totally be dependent on these games or virtual reality that we will play characters in a world that we may enjoy liking one day. Will it be our heaven. Imagine doing anything and having anything you want on these virtual world. Also are our lives games? Who is playing us? A more intellignet species?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I basically see the world recreating itself when i play video games and i look at todays technology. Technology is moving at superfast speeds and it is getting smaller and smaller. I the creation of a new specie. A virtual specie. We will play these characters. We want a better world. We will get it in virtual reality until we transform ourselves into their world. We will recreat another world. A world where we are who we want to be and do what we want. Imagine a virtual world so realistic that we don't know if it is real of fake. It will be our heaven. Eventually we will like it so much that we will upload our brains into that world and live forever. :) I hope this doesn't sound like i am crazy. I just think alot.</p></td>

Yeah, I posted this before, but I would like to suggest again: check your breathing. As you breath in and out you do things or think thoughts, be comfortable with them.</p></td>
