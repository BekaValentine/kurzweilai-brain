<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/negroponte_entry.html">Nicholas Negroponte</a> is the visible face of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, an articulate 
              advocate of being <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>. Far fewer people know of Jerome Wiesner's 
              role. Jerry was MIT's president, and Kennedy's <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> advisor. 
              He's been described as the member of the administration during that 
              exceptional era who was not only smart, but also wise.</p>
<p>As I started attending faculty meetings I soon discovered that 
              Jerry was even more bored with them than I was. If I sat next to 
              him he would tell me stories, like how the debate in the meeting 
              we were ignoring mirrored a fight he had had in the Cabinet. Through 
              these discussions I learned a secret: the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab is really a 
              front for an even more interesting project.</p>
<p>After a lifetime of shaping <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, Jerry felt that there was 
              a big hole in the middle of academia in general, and at MIT in particular. 
              Disciplines were kept apart, <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> and applied <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> happened 
              in different places at different times, and industrial interaction 
              was based on handing off results rather than intimate collaboration. 
              Most serious of all, <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of many kinds had no place on campus. 
              As a physicist in a normal department I could look at <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, 
              but not toys. I might see industrialists, but not artists.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab was his last grand project, a meta-<a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> in 
              organizing inquiry for a new era. He knew that this goal was so 
              interesting and <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant that he could never really discuss it 
              openly. There would be too many conflicting interests for it ever 
              to be accomplished by a committee. Instead, Nicholas and his colleagues 
              at the predecessor to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, the <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">Architecture</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> Group, 
              provided the perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> agenda and working style to create 
              a laboratory laboratory.</p>
<p>It took me a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to recognize this hidden project. When I 
              started visiting, I didn't see the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab as a place to do serious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>; it was an entertaining diversion from the real work that 
              I was doing elsewhere. I expected to eventually go to an industrial 
              laboratory to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up my <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> group (I had found that I was too 
              practical to be happy in a traditional academic setting). And Nicholas 
              certainly didn't see the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab as a place for something as dry 
              and remote as a <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> lab.</p>
<p>When we finally sat down to talk, he told me a story to explain 
              his surprise at the prospect of my coming to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab. He said 
              that if there was a monastery on top of a hill, and a brothel down 
              in a valley, he wouldn't expect there to be too much traffic between 
              the two institutions. I was struck by this image, but for the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 
              of me I couldn't figure out which lab was which. I'm even less sure 
              now.</p>
<p>The more we spoke, the more we realized that it did make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> 
              for the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab to have a <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> group. For me, it would provide 
              the support to work on <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> in the new <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s where it is needed. 
              I knew how to do <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>; the hard thing was getting <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the 
              emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. For Nicholas, it would provide the tools and techniques 
              to help open up <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and move <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> out into the world 
              where it is needed.</p>
<p>In retrospect I'm embarrassed by how long it took me to decide 
              that it was okay to have fun for a living. I had been trained to 
              believe that the sorts of things I had been doing in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, 
              like working on Yo-Yo's cello, were done on the side by serious 
              scientists, not as part of their day job. I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that trying 
              to do <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> outside of a <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> department was going to be a 
              radical and uncertain step.</p>
<p>I realized that it was going to work when students started showing 
              up, explaining that they loved <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, but that they knew they 
              did not want to study it in a traditional department. They were 
              unwilling to disconnect their personal passions from their intellectual 
              pursuits, and they did not want to follow a conventional academic 
              career path with limited prospects for funding and employment. This 
              was brought home one day by a headline in MIT's campus newspaper, 
              "Cutbacks Announced in Dance and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a>."</p>
<p>I was also concerned about where my students would publish their 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> papers; I had expected that we would have to dissect out 
              the pure academic nuggets from the impure <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. Here again I 
              realized that this was not going to be a problem when journal editors 
              started showing up in my lab to solicit submissions. They recognize 
              that the world is changing, and they don't want to keep publishing 
              the same kinds of papers.</p>
<p>As my lab grew, my biggest surprise was watching how my students 
              were reinventing the organization of their <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. Scientific 
              training has traditionally been based around extensive classwork, 
              illustrated by occasional labs. My students were turning that inside 
              out.</p>
<p>That they were in my lab at all was due to Edwin Land, the founder 
              of Polaroid. He felt that MIT's undergrads should be in working 
              laboratories participating in real <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> as it happened, rather 
              than doing rote repetitions in lab classes long after the fact. 
              He provided the seed funding for a very successful <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to do 
              just that.</p>
<p>The undergrads in my lab used it for far more than what Land originally 
              envisioned. It became their home, the place where they learned to 
              work with people and use disciplines to solve hard problems. Their 
              classes took on a supporting role, providing the raw material that 
              got shaped into an <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> in my lab. Over and over they told 
              me that they had no idea why they were being taught something until 
              they got to use it in one of our projects. For them, this <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              was more like being in a studio than a classroom.</p>
<p>I found that one of the best predictors of a student's success 
              working this way was their grades: I look to make sure they have 
              a few F's. Students with perfect grades almost always don't work 
              out, because it means they've spent their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> trying to meticulously 
              follow classroom instructions that are absent in the rest of the 
              world. Students with A's and F's have a much better record, because 
              they're able to do good work, and also <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> priorities for themselves. 
              They're the ones most able to pose&amp;#8212and solve&#8212;problems 
              that go far beyond anything I might assign to them.</p>
<p>The present <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of classes does not serve the students, or their 
              teachers, very well. One week an MIT undergrad, and independently 
              an MIT professor, asked me the same question: how does the <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> 
              of a telephone line relate to the <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> rate of a modem? The <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> 
              is the range of frequencies a phone line can pass, which is <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> 
              by the phone companies and regulatory agencies. The <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> rate is 
              how fast <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> gets sent, all too noticeable as the speed with which 
              a Web page loads. They were wondering how the <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> affects 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> rate that can be achieved, and what the prospects were for 
              faster modems.</p>
<p>This is the problem that Shannon solved in the 1940s with his theory 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>: the maximum possible <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> rate is the <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> times 
              the logarithm of one plus the ratio of the strength of the signal 
              to the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> rate can be improved by using more 
              frequencies, by sending a stronger signal, or by decreasing the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>. Modems are now near the limit of a conventional phone channel, 
              although the wires themselves can handle <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> much faster.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that someone could be at MIT as long as 
              both the student and professor had been, studying <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              in many forms, and never have heard of a result as <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant as 
              this. Not only that, both were unprepared to understand where it 
              came from and what conclusions might be drawn from it.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">Entropy</a> shows up in two places in their question, in analyzing 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> that is intrinsic to the materials in a telephone, and 
              in analyzing the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that can be carried by a message sent 
              through the telephone. Although these two calculations are closely 
              related, physicists learn how to do the former in one part of campus, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers the latter in another. Very few students manage to 
              be sufficiently bilingual to be able to do both. Those who are either 
              take so many classes beyond the usual load that they manage to squeeze 
              in a few different simultaneous degrees, or take so few classes 
              that they have enough <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to put these pieces together on their 
              own. Either path requires unusual initiative to answer such a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able 
              question.</p>
<p>Faced with students who knew a lot about a little, I decided that 
              I had to teach everything. This took the form of two semester-long 
              courses, one covering the physical world outside of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">Information Technology</a>), and the other the logical world 
              inside <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> of Mathematical Modeling). My students 
              loved them; some of my peers at MIT hated them. This was because 
              each week I would cover material that usually takes a full semester.</p>
<p>I did this by teaching just those things that are remembered and 
              used long after a class has ended, rather than everything that gets 
              thrown in. This starts by introducing the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> in an area so 
              that the students, for example, know that <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> rate and <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> 
              are related by Shannon's channel <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. Then I cover enough of 
              each subject to enable students to be able to understand where the 
              results come from and how they are used; at this point they would 
              know how to calculate the channel <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Each 
              week ends with pointers into the specialized literature so that, 
              for example, students learn that Shannon's limit effectively can 
              be exceeded by taking advantage of quirks of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>. Although 
              this brisk pace does a disservice to any one area, unless I teach 
              this way most people won't see most things. It is only by violating 
              the norms of what must be taught in each discipline that I can convey 
              the value of the disciplines.</p>
<p>What connects the work in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab is a sensibility, a style 
              of working, a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of shared questions and applications. It's not 
              a discipline, a distinct body of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that has stood the test 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and that brings <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to a broad area of our <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> on the former relies on the latter. </p>
<p>In many places <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are studied in separate departments, meaning 
              that students who like <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s get less exposure to <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, and hence can have less insight into how <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              work. This can result in their using the wrong tool for the wrong 
              problem, and in their being unable to distinguish between hard things 
              that look easy and easy things that look hard.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists have told me that they want to 
              mount display screens in glasses. They know that the eye cannot 
              focus on something so close, so they intend to be clever and blur 
              the image in just the right way to compensate for the optics of 
              the eye. Unfortunately, this nice idea has no chance at all of working. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> passing through a lens must be specified by both its intensity 
              and direction; the image on a display can control only the intensity. 
              There is no <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that can change the direction that <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> is 
              emitted from a conventional display.</p>
<p>Or, some <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists were looking for a source of random 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s for <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a>, which depends for security on having a 
              steady supply of random keys. They hit on the idea of aiming the 
              camera connected to their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> at a 1960s lava lamp, and using 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the blobs as a source of randomness. In fact, a lava 
              lamp is appealing to watch precisely because it is not completely 
              random; there is a great deal of <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>. The electrical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> from a simple resistor is not only much easier to measure, 
              it is one of the most random things that we know of. A far more 
              convenient <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> can solve their problem far better.</p>
<p>One more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist showed me the automated cart he developed 
              for delivering mail. With great pride he turned it on and together 
              we watched it crash into the wall. He was measuring the position 
              of the cart by counting the revolutions of its wheels; if they slip 
              at all it gets completely lost. I explained that there were techniques 
              for measuring location inside a building, something like the <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> used outside of a building. His instant response was, "Oh, 
              that's <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>." It was the wrong level of description for him, 
              so he was going to struggle on with <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> patches for a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> 
              that could never work reliably.</p>
<p>An <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> that forces people to specialize in <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, 
              sends them out into the world with an erroneous impression that 
              the two are easily separated. It is even embodied in our legal <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>, 
              in the workings of the U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">Patent</a> Office. A <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> must scrupulously 
              distinguish between apparatus claims, on <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> claims, 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. This means that "the medium is the message" is actually 
              illegal: the message must be separated from the medium for <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> 
              protection.</p>
<p>The best <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> examiners recognize that new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is stretching 
              the boundaries of old rules, and are flexible about interpreting 
              them. The worst examiners refuse to accept that a single <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> 
              can simultaneously embody a physical apparatus and a logical <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>. 
              I've spent years winding my way through the legal <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> with a 
              particularly obtuse examiner who insists on trying to split an <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> 
              into its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, even though the function 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> cannot be seen in either alone but arises only through 
              their interaction.</p>
<p>Companies can't help but notice that these kinds of distinctions 
              no longer make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. I realized that we're living through a new 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a> when I saw how many senior executives visiting 
              my lab said that they had no idea what business they were in. A 
              newspaper company gathers and creates <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, annotates and 
              edits it, sells <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">advertising</a>, runs printing presses, and has a delivery 
              fleet. As <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> make it possible to separate these functions, 
              which of them are core competencies and which are legacy businesses? 
              The answer is not clear, but the question certainly is.</p>
<p>One morning I met with a company that explained that they had reached 
              the limit of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> in what could be designed with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              and given the development cost of their product they needed better 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s for designers to interact with large amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. 
              That afternoon a company explained that they had reached the limit 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> in what could be designed with a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and given 
              the development cost of their product they needed better <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s 
              for designers to interact with large amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. The 
              former made <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a>s; the latter jet <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s.</p>
<p>In the face of such rapid and uncertain change, a few lessons are 
              emerging about how companies can respond. Instead of storing up 
              large <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>ies of supplies and products, raw materials should 
              arrive just in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to make products on demand. Management and computing 
              should be done close to where the business happens, not in a central 
              office. And production should be organized in flexible workgroups, 
              not in regimented assembly lines or narrow departments.</p>
<p>Many of the same <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s apply to <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, but few of these 
              lessons have been learned. Universities go on filling students with 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>y of raw <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to be called on later; this is sensible 
              if the world is changing slowly, but it is not. An alternative is 
              just-in-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, drawing on <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al resources as needed 
              in support of larger projects.</p>
<p>One of the best classes I ever taught at MIT was at one in the 
              morning in Penn &amp; Teller's warehouse in Las Vegas. We had gone 
              out with a group of students to finish <a class="thought" href="entries/debugging_entry.html">debugging</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> chair 
              prior to its first performance. In the middle of the night all of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> finally came together. Before the <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> could be tested, 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> had to combine the raw signals from the sensors to determine 
              where the player's hands were. This is a classic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> analysis problem. 
              So I gave an impromptu lecture on function fitting to students who 
              were eager (desperate, really) to learn it, and who then retained 
              the ideas long after the performance was over.</p>
<p>The big new thing on campuses now is distance <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, using videoconferencing 
              and videotapes to let people far from a place like MIT take classes 
              there. This is an awful lot like <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> computing, where there 
              is a centralized <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> processor to which remote <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> peripherals 
              get attached. Just like management or <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing, the 
              most valuable <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> is local. Far more interesting than letting 
              people eavesdrop from a distance is providing them with tools to 
              learn locally.</p>
<p>Some of this is happening naturally, as the Web lowers the threshold 
              to make <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> widely available. More and more articles get 
              shared through <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>s such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050212224259/http://xxx.lanl.gov/" target="_blank">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a> 
              without needing to travel to <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> libraries to read expensive 
              journals. Through the working notes my group puts on the Web, I 
              discovered that we have virtual collaborators who use our results 
              and provide <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful feedback long before the notes are formally 
              published.</p>
<p>And some of this is happening through the tools. The same <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              that lets us embed surprisingly sophisticated and flexible sensing 
              and computing into children's toys or consumer appliances helps 
              make the means for meaningful scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation much more 
              widely <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible. A Lego <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> today can make measurements that were 
              done only in specialized labs not too long ago.</p>
<p>Academics visiting the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab usually start by asking what department 
              we are in. They have a hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> understanding that the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab 
              is our academic home, not an appendage to another department. Uniquely 
              at MIT, it both grants degrees and manages <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> and 
              doing elsewhere are separated into departments and laboratories.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">Military</a> types visiting want to see an organizational chart, and 
              are puzzled when we say that there isn't one. I spent a day with 
              a Hollywood studio executive who kept asking who gets to green-<a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> 
              projects. He was completely perplexed when I told him that more 
              often than not projects get initiated by the undergrads. Most every 
              day I come to work knowing exactly what we should do next, and most 
              every day they show me I'm wrong.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that there are many different ways to view the organization 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, all correct: by projects, by disciplines, by levels 
              of description, by industrial consortia, by people. It functions 
              as an intellectual work group that can easily be reconfigured to 
              tackle new problems. Once visitors understand this (lack of) <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, 
              the next question they ask is how the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab can be copied, and 
              why there aren't more already.</p>
<p>In part, the answer is that it just requires getting these few 
              organizational lessons right, but few institutions are willing to 
              make that leap. We've had an unblemished record of failure in helping 
              start spin-offs from the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab elsewhere. What always happens 
              is that when it comes <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to open the new lab, whoever is paying 
              for it expects to run it, choosing the projects and controlling 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>. They're unwilling to let go of either, 
              letting the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> agenda trickle up from the grassroots, and 
              eliminating <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> as any kind of barrier to collaboration.</p>
<p>In part, the answer is that there are a few unique features of 
              the environment of the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab that don't show up on any formal 
              documents. To start, running the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab is a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> like driving 
              a bumper car at an amusement park. While we're more or less in control, 
              the rest of MIT provides a great deal of enabling physical and intellectual 
              infrastructure. This leads to steady jostling, but it would be impossible 
              for the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab to function in isolation outside of that less-visible 
              institutional support.</p>
<p>Even that has a hidden piece. It was only after spending <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at 
              both Harvard and MIT that I realized that Cambridge has one university 
              with two campuses, one for <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and one for humanities. While 
              of course there are plenty of exceptions, broadly MIT's strength 
              as a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> school frees Harvard from even trying to lead the 
              world in bridge building, and because of Harvard's strengths MIT 
              can be less concerned about Classics. Since MIT does not have a 
              school of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, or a film school, there is not a turf battle 
              over the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab working on those things.</p>
<p>Then there are the students. It's not that they're any smarter 
              than students elsewhere; it's that they're so desperate to make 
              things work. I've never seen any group of people anywhere so willing 
              to go without eating and sleeping to reduce something to practice. 
              It almost doesn't even <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what it is.</p>
<p>One day I came in and found that my lab had been co-opted to make 
              a grass display, a lawn mounted on mechanical pixels that could 
              move to make an ambient agricultural <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> channel. The students 
              building it labored heroically to make the drive <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s that could 
              handle that much power, and fabricate the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> the 
              drive solenoids with the sod. The only thing they couldn't do is 
              tell me why they were doing it. Once they realized that it was possible, 
              they could not conceive of not making one.</p>
<p>About a month later I came in and found that my students had been 
              up many nights in a row, hacking an <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> into a global satellite 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to get sensor <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> off the summit of Mount Everest for an 
              expedition that Mike Hawley was putting together. They developed, 
              debugged, and deployed a satellite terminal in a few days, slept 
              for a few days, then went back to whatever else they had been doing. 
              No one had ever been able to collect weather <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from on top of 
              Everest, since most people there are just trying to stay alive. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from their probe went via satellite to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, and 
              from there it went to <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary scientists as well as to base camp 
              to be relayed up to climbers on the mountain.</p>
<p>When the designer of the satellite link, Matt Reynolds, showed 
              up in my lab as a freshman he was already the best radiofrequency 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er I'd ever met, including during my <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as a technician 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/bell_labs_entry.html">Bell Labs</a>. This is a technical specialty that few people really 
              master, and usually then only after a lifetime of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. It's 
              hard not to believe that Matt's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is genetic, or comes from 
              a past <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. He as much as confirmed that one evening after we attended 
              a conference in San Francisco, when we were happily sitting on a 
              deck in Big <a class="thought" href="entries/sur_entry.html">Sur</a> watching a memorable sunset. I casually asked him 
              how he chose to come to MIT. The <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> ground to a halt; 
              it was almost as if I had said something inappropriate. He paused, 
              struggled to answer, and then said that he had known he was going 
              to go to MIT since he was a fetus. He didn't choose to go to MIT, 
              he had a calling to serve.</p>
<p>Another freshman, Edward Boyden, appeared one day with a ten-page 
              manifesto for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of all <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. It was the most interesting 
              nonsense I've read; he didn't have any of the details right, but 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> and sensibility were wise far beyond his limited scientific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. He came in with almost no relevant skills. I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> him 
              to work helping a grad student; in January Edward learned <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming, in February he learned how to do 3D graphics and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              video, in March how to numerically model the behavior of electric 
              fields, so that in April he could put all the pieces together and 
              render the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> underlying the sensors we were developing to 
              see with fields. Having caught up to the grad student, Ed's only 
              reaction was to be frustrated by his own slow pace.</p>
<p>It makes no <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to funnel that kind of raw problem-solving ability 
              through a conventional curriculum. Edward learns too quickly, and 
              is too intellectually omniverous, to be <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> following a prescribed 
              path through <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Matt spends a tiny fraction of each day 
              taking care of the formal requirements of his classes, then gets 
              back to <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> things that go far beyond the classes. They arrived 
              understanding a lesson that it usually takes students longer to 
              learn: the goal of classes is to get you to not want to take classes. 
              Once students know how to read the literature, and teach themselves, 
              and find and learn from experts, then classes should take on a supporting 
              role to help <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> unfamiliar areas.</p>
<p>One of the most meaningful moments in my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> came in an airport 
              lounge. I was waiting to fly back from my brother's wedding, and 
              ended up sitting with our family rabbi. In this informal setting, 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> before the plane and no distractions, I screwed up my 
              courage to say something that I had wanted to tell him for a long 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. I explained that I found the morality, and <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, and teachings 
              of Judaism to be deeply significant, but that I had a hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              reciting formal rituals I didn't believe in. He beamed, and said 
              that the same was true for him. Letting me in on a secret, he told 
              me that he saw many of the ceremonial aspects of Jewish observance 
              as a formal scaffolding to engage people's attention while the real 
              meaning of the <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> got conveyed around the edges. The formal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> was valuable, but as a means rather than an end.</p>
<p>Rather than start with the presumption that all students need most 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> filled with ritual observance, the organization of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab starts by putting them in interesting environments 
              that bring together challenging problems and relevant tools, and 
              then draws on more traditional classes to support that enterprise. 
              The faster the world changes, the more precious traditional disciplines 
              become as reliable guides into unfamiliar terrain, but the less 
              relevant they are as axes to organize inquiry.</p>
