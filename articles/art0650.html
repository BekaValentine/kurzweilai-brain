<p><i>Founded in December 2002, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.crnano.org/" target="_blank">Center

              a lot for a couple of volunteers to shoulder, but Mike Treder and 
              Chris Phoenix have carried their burden well, and done much to raise 
              awareness of the potential risks and benefits of molecular manufacturing,

              &#8212; Jamais Cascio</i></p>
<p><b>WorldChanging:</b> So, to start&#8212;what is the Center for 
              Responsible Nanotechnology hoping to make happen?</p>
<p><b>Center for Responsible Nanotechnology:</b> We want to help create 
              a world in which advanced nanotechnology&#8212;molecular manufacturing&#8212;is 
              widely used for beneficial purposes, and in which the risks are 
              responsibly managed. The ability to manufacture highly advanced 
              nanotech products at an exponentially accelerating pace will have 
              profound and perilous implications for all of <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, and our goal 
              is to lay a foundation for handling them wisely.</p>
<p><b><b>WC:</b></b> So you <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a non-profit. How is that going?</p>
<p><b><b>CRN:</b></b> CRN is a volunteer organization. We have no 
              paid positions. Our co-founders have dedicated <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to this cause 
              in lieu of professional paying careers. But the thing is, technical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward nanotechnology is really accelerating, and it's 
              become more urgent than ever for us to examine the global implications 
              of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and begin designing wise and effective solutions.</p>
<p>It won't be easy. CRN needs to grow, quickly, to meet the expanding 
              challenge. We're asking people who share the belief that our <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              must keep moving ahead to support us with small or large donations.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> One of the unusual aspects of CRN is that you're neither 
              a nanotech advocacy group nor unmoving nanotech critics. Your focus 
              is on the responsible development and deployment of next-generation 
              nanotechnologies. Tell me a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> about what "responsible nanotechnology" 
              looks like.</p>
<p><b><b>CRN:</b></b> You&#8217;re right that we have tried hard to 
              stay in a "middle" place. We sometimes refer to it as 
              between resignation (forsaking attempts to manage the technology) 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> (forsaking the technology altogether). Our view 
              is that advanced nanotechnology&#8212;molecular manufacturing&#8212;should 
              be developed as fast as it can be done safely and responsibly. We&#8217;re 
              promoting responsible rapid development of the technology&#8212;not 
              because we believe it is safe, but because we believe it is risky&#8212;and 
              because the only realistic alternative to responsible development 
              is irresponsible development.</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> So, what does 'responsible' mean? First, that we take 
              effective precautions to forestall a new arms race. Second, that 
              we do what is necessary to prevent a monopoly on the technology 
              by one nation, one bloc of nations, or one multinational corporation. 
              Third, that we seek appropriate ways to share the tremendous benefits 
              of the technology as widely as possible; we should not allow a 'nano-divide.' 
              Fourth, that we recognize the possibilities for both positive and 
              negative impacts on the environment from molecular manufacturing, 
              and that we adopt sensible global regulations on its use. And fifth, 
              that we understand and take precautions to avert the risk of severe 
              economic disruption, social <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, and consequent <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> suffering.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> How does the "responsible" approach differ 
              from something like the "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/000375.html" target="_blank">Precautionary 
              Principle</a>?" What's your take on the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of "precaution" 
              applied to emerging technologies?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> One of our earliest published papers was on that very 
              topic. It&#8217;s called "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://crnano.org/precautionary.htm" target="_blank">Applying 
              the Precautionary Principle to Nanotechnology</a>." CRN&#8217;s 
              analysis shows that there are actually two different forms of the 
              Precautionary Principle, something that many people don&#8217;t realize. 
              We call them the 'strict form' and the 'active form.'</p>
<p>The strict form of the Precautionary Principle requires inaction 
              when <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> might pose a risk. In contrast, the active form calls 
              for choosing less risky alternatives when they are available, and 
              for taking responsibility for potential risks. Because the strict 
              form of the Precautionary Principle does not allow consideration 
              of the risks of inaction, CRN believes that it is not appropriate 
              as a test of molecular manufacturing policy.</p>
<p>The active form of the Precautionary Principle, however, seems 
              quite appropriate as a guide for developing molecular manufacturing 
              policy. Given the extreme risks presented by misuse of nanotechnology, 
              it appears imperative to find and <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the least risky plan 
              that is realistically feasible. Although we cannot agree with the 
              strict form of the Precautionary Principle, we do support the active 
              form.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> What is the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.crnano.org/CTF.htm" target="_blank">CRN 
              Task Force</a>, and what do you hope to have it accomplish? [Disclaimer: 
              I am a member of the CRN Task Force.]</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Without mutual understanding and cooperation on a global 
              level, the hazardous potentials of advanced nanotechnology could 
              spiral out of control and deny any hope of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002365.html" target="_blank">realizing 
              the benefits to society</a>. We&#8217;re not willing to leave the 
              outcome to chance.</p>
<p>So, last August we announced the formation of a new Task Force, 
              convened to study the societal implications of this rapidly emerging 
              technology. We&#8217;ve brought together a diverse group of more 
              than 60 world-class experts from multiple disciplines to assist 
              us in developing comprehensive recommendations for the safe and 
              responsible use of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Our first project is just nearing completion. Members of the task 
              force have written a series of essays describing their greatest 
              concerns about the potential impacts of molecular manufacturing. 
              We have completed editing approximately 20 excellent articles that 
              range from discussion of economic issues and security issues, to 
              the implications of human enhancement and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. 
              They will be published in the March 2006 issue of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://pages.unibas.ch/colbas/ntp/" target="_blank">Nanotechnology 
              Perceptions</a>, an academic journal maintained by a couple of European 
              universities. We will simultaneously publish the essays at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://wise-nano.org/" target="_blank">Wise-Nano.org</a> 
              website, where anyone can read and comment on them.<br>

<p><b>WC:</b> We've discussed the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003445.html" target="_blank">different 
              kinds of nanotechnology</a> on WorldChanging, and you folks posted 
              a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/09/nanoparticles_n.html" target="_blank">very 
              useful follow-up</a> to one of our pieces on that subject. To be 
              clear, when we talk about "nanotechnology" in this <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, 
              we're talking about "nanofactories." So let's drill down 
              a bit on that particular subject. What kinds of things could an 
              early version of a nanofactory make? Are we just talking desktop 
              printing of simple physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s (like a cup), items embedding 
              diverse materials &amp; <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s (like a laptop), or organic 
              and biochemical materials (like <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>s or food)?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> The first, tiny nanofactory will be built by intricate 
              laboratory techniques; then that nanofactory will have to build 
              a bigger one, and so on, many times over. This means that even the 
              earliest usable nanofactory will necessarily work extremely fast 
              and be capable of making highly functional products with moving 
              parts. So, in addition to laptops and phones, an early nanofactory 
              should be able to make cars, home appliances, and a wide array of 
              other products.</p>
<p>Medicines and food will not be early products. A large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 
              reactions will be required to make the vast variety of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. 
              Some molecules will be synthesized more easily than others. It may 
              work better first to build (using a nanofactory) an advanced fluidic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that can do traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>.</p>
<p>Food will be especially difficult because it contains water. Water 
              is a small molecule that would float around and gum up the factory. 
              Also, food contains a number of large and intricate molecules for 
              taste and smell; furthermore, nourishing food requires mineral <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s 
              that would require extra research to handle with nanofactory-type 
              processes.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> It seems to me that manufacturing via nanofactories 
              will require some different concepts of the manufacturing process 
              than the automated assembly-line model most of us probably have 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> when we think of "factories." Parallel to early 
              design work on the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> end, has there been much work done on 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>/design end of how nanofactories would work?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> We have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about how nanofactories would be controlled, 
              and it seems probable that it's just not a very difficult problem, 
              at least for the kind of nanofactory that can include lots of integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. (This should include almost any diamond-building nanofactory, 
              and a lot of nanofactories based on other technologies as well.)</p>
<p>Until automated design capabilities are developed, products will 
              be limited largely by our product design skills. A simple product-description 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, roughly <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to PostScript, would be able to build 
              an enormous range of products, but would not even require fancy 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ing in the nanofactory. (Drexler discusses product-description 
              languages in section 14.6 of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=worldchangi0b-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471575186%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1139256738%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8" target="_blank"><i>Nanosystems</i></a>.)</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> What makes nanofactories so different from traditional 
              production <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> It's <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to understand that molecular manufacturing 
              implies exponential manufacturing&#8212;the ability to rapidly build 
              as many desktop nanofactories (sometimes called personal fabricators) 
              as you have the resources for. Starting with one nanofactory, someone 
              could build thousands of additional nanofactories in a day or less, 
              at very low cost. This means that projects of almost any size can 
              be accomplished quickly.</p>
<p>Those who have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the technology could use it to build a 
              surveillance system to track six billion people, <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s systems 
              far more powerful than the world's combined conventional forces, 
              construction on a planetary scale, or spaceflight as easy as airplane 
              flight is today.</p>
<p>Massive construction isn't always bad. Rapid construction could 
              allow us to build environmental remediation technologies on a huge 
              scale. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory are suggesting 
              that equipment could be built to remove significant quantities of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide directly from the atmosphere. With molecular manufacturing, 
              this could be done far more quickly, easily, and inexpensively.</p>
<p>In addition to being powerful, the technology will also be deft 
              and exquisite. Medical research and treatment will advance rapidly, 
              given access to nearly unlimited numbers of medical robots and sensors 
              that are smaller than a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>.</p>
<p>This only scratches the surface of the implications. Molecular 
              manufacturing has as many implications as electricity, computers, 
              and gasoline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> In other words, nanotechnology is both an engineering 
              process and (for lack of a less jargony phrase) an "enabling 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>"&#8212;it doesn't just make it possible to do what 
              we now do, but better/faster/ cheaper, it also makes it possible 
              (in time) to do some things that we can't now do.</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Yes, exactly. Another good way to look at it is as 
              a general-purpose technology: enhancing and enabling a wide range 
              of applications. It will be similar in effect to, say, electricity 
              or computers.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> Back up a sec. The complexities of surveillance systems, 
              planetary engineering, and cheap &amp; easy <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> flight come from 
              much more than not being able to make enough or sufficiently-precise 
              gear. There are also questions of design, of power, of scale, and 
              so forth. These seem likely to take substantial effort and time.</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> The speed of development will differ for each project. 
              But by today's standards, almost any project could be done quite 
              quickly. A lot of hardware development time today is spent in compensating 
              for the high cost and large delay associated with building each 
              prototype. If you could build a prototype in a few hours at low 
              cost, a lot of engineering could be bypassed. Of course, this is 
              less true for safety-critical systems. But imagine how quickly space 
              flight could be developed if Elon Musk (SpaceX), John Carmack (Armadillo), 
              and Burt Rutan could each build and fly a new (unmanned) spacecraft 
              every day instead of waiting three months or more.</p>
<p>Power will of course have to be supplied to any project. But one 
              of the first projects may be a massive solar-gathering array that 
              could supply power for planet-scale engineering. A nanofactory-built 
              solar array should be able to repay the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> cost of its construction 
              in just a few days, so scaling up the solar array itself would not 
              take too long.</p>
<p>A comparable advantage can be seen today in computer <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> design. 
              FPGA's and <a class="thought" href="entries/asic_entry.html">ASIC</a>'s are two similar kinds of configurable computer 
              chips. They differ in that ASIC's are designed before they are built, 
              and FPGA's can have new designs <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ed to them in seconds, even 
              after they are integrated into a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>. An FPGA can be designed 
              by a person in a week or two. An ASIC requires a team of people 
              working for several months&#8212;largely to make absolutely sure 
              that they have not made even a single mistake, which could cost 
              the company millions of dollars and months of delay. The difference 
              between today's development cycle and nanofactory-enabled product 
              R&amp;D is the difference between ASIC's and FPGA's.</p>

<p><b>CRN:</b> There are only a few companies that are explicitly 
              working on molecular manufacturing. Many more are doing work that 
              is relevant, but not aiming at that goal&#8212;or at least not admitting 
              to it.</p>

              this used a much larger scanning probe microscope to move the atoms, 
              it is not a large-scale manufacturing technique.</p>
<p>Researchers at Rice University have developed a "nano-car" 
              with single-molecule wheels that roll on molecular bearings, and 
              reportedly are aiming toward "nano-trucks" that could 
              transport molecules in miniature factories.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> To what degree is nanotechnology research a province 
              of the big industrial countries, and to what degree is it accessible 
              to forward-looking developing countries (what we term on WorldChanging 
              the "leapfrog nations")?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> In the broad <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of nanoscale technologies, some 
              kinds of nanotech research are quite accessible to leapfrog nations. 
              Molecular manufacturing research may be accessible as well. <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">Atom</a>-level 
              simulations can now be run on desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>'s. Some of the development 
              pathways, such as biopolymer approaches, require only a small lab's 
              worth of equipment.</p>
<p>We don't yet know exactly how difficult it will be to develop a 
              nanofactory. Several approaches are on the table, but there could 
              be a much easier approach waiting to be discovered. It's probably 
              safe to say that any nation that can support a space <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> could 
              also engage in substantial research toward molecular manufacturing. 
              Note that several individuals are now supporting space programs, 
              including Elon Musk of SpaceX and Paul Allen who funded SpaceShipOne.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> Do you expect home "hobbyist" designers&#8212;perhaps 
              using home-made nanotools&#8212;to have any role in the nanotechnology 
              revolution, as "garage <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s" did in the early days 
              of personal computing?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> We have been aware of some of the scanning probe microscope 
              efforts. If advanced molecular manufacturing requires a <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> scanning-probe 
              system cooled by liquid helium, it's doubtful you could do that 
              in your garage. On the other hand, if all it requires is an inert-gas 
              environment at liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> temperatures, then some work might 
              be doable by a very competent hobbyist.</p>
<p><i>Design</i> of nanomachines (as opposed to construction) is already 
              accessible to hobbyists. Without the ability to test their designs 
              in the lab, many of the designs will have bugs, of course. However, 
              at least in the early stages, the development of new design approaches 
              and the demonstration that we've learned even approximately how 
              to implement mechanisms will be important contributions.</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> A big concern in a world of easy fabrication is what 
              to do with broken or obsolete stuff. In what ways could a nanofactory-type 
              system use "waste" materials, with an eye towards the 
              "cradle-to-cradle" concept?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> If the stuff is made of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> atoms, such as carbon 
              and nitrogen, it should be straightforward to burn it in an enclosed 
              system. The resulting gases could be cooled and then sorted at a 
              molecular level, and the molecules could be stored for re-use.</p>
<p>It seems likely that products will be designed and built using 
              modules that would be somewhat smaller than a human cell. If these 
              modules are standardized and re-usable, then it might be possible 
              to pull apart a product and rearrange the modules into a different 
              product. However, there are practical problems: the modules themselves 
              may be obsolete, and they would need to be carefully cleaned before 
              they could be reassembled. It would probably be easier to reduce 
              them to atoms and start over, since every atom could be contained 
              and re-used.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> That seems likely to take a serious amount of energy 
              to accomplish thoroughly, am I right? That is, if I toss my cell 
              phone into an incinerator, different parts will cook at different 
              temperatures, and there are some <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s that would require some 
              fairly high temps to break down. In addition, the nano-incinerator 
              will need to be able to sort out the various atoms that are emitted 
              by the burning object. Sounds complex.</p>
<p>This becomes an important issue, because a world where it's really 
              easy to make stuff but much harder to get rid of it starts to accelerate 
              some already-serious problems around garbage, especially hazardous 
              wastes.</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Breaking down a carbon-based product just requires 
              heating it a bit, then exposing it to <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a>&#8212;something 
              that can combine with the carbon to produce small gas molecules. 
              This process will likely be exothermic&#8212;in other words, being 
              high in carbon, nano-built products would burn very nicely when 
              you wanted them to. (Adding small integrated water tanks that were 
              drained before recycling would prevent premature combustion.)</p>
<p>Constructing a nano-built product requires not only rearranging 
              a lot of molecular bonds, but computing how to do that, and moving 
              around a lot of nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry. A nanofactory might require 
              several times the bond energy to accomplish all that. The energy 
              required to break down a nano-built product should be less than 
              the energy it took to make it in the first place. And in terms of 
              product strength per energy invested, nano-built diamond would probably 
              be many times better than aluminum&#8212;a cheap, energy-intensive 
              commodity.</p>

              fabrication tools like nanofactories.</p>
<p>What do you see as the key <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> issues emerging 
              from the rise of nanomanufacturing?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Because molecular manufacturing will be a general-purpose 
              technology, we can expect that it will raise many of the issues 
              that exist today in many different <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s. Many issues will be 
              the same as for software and <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a>, but the stakes will 
              be far higher. The issues we see in medicine, with controversies 
              over whether affordable <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s should be provided to developing 
              nations, will also apply to humanitarian applications of nanofactory 
              products.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b>To tease that point out for a minute, you're suggesting 
              that the issue won't be with the difficulty or expense of making 
              the materials, but the expense of the time necessary to come up 
              with the design in the first place. Big pharma argues that the majority 
              of their work is actually in dead ends, and that the high fees they 
              charge for the drugs that do work are to make up for the time they 
              take with the stuff that doesn't work. Would the nanofactory world&#8212;at 
              least the early days of it&#8212;parallel this?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> It's not an exact parallel. Some percentage of pharmaceutical 
              development costs go to preliminary testing, another percentage 
              to clinical trials&#8212;which are hugely expensive due to regulation 
              and liability&#8212;and a third percentage to <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">advertising</a> and incentives 
              for doctors to prescribe the new medicine. Of these three, probably 
              only the first will apply to early nanofactory products.</p>
<p>We do expect design time to be a large component of the cost of 
              a product. But the Open Source software movement shows that significant 
              design time can be contributed without adding to product price.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> So you see Open Source as an aspect of the nanofactory 
              future?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Whether or not open source approaches will be allowed 
              to develop nanofactory products is the single biggest intellectual 
              property question. Open source software has been astonishingly creative 
              and innovative, and open source products could be a rich source 
              of innovation as well as humanitarian designs. Even businesses could 
              benefit, since open source usually doesn't put a final polish on 
              its products, so <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> interests can repackage them and sell 
              at a good profit.</p>
<p>However, the business interests that will want a monopoly, and 
              the security institutions that will be uncomfortable with unrestricted 
              fabbing, will probably oppose open source products. It would be 
              easy to criminalize unrestricted fabbing, though far more difficult 
              to prevent it. Prevention of private innovation, through simply 
              not allowing private ownership of nanofactories, would have to be 
              rigorously enforced worldwide&#8212;likely impossible, and certainly 
              oppressive. Criminalization without prevention would almost certainly 
              be bad policy, but it will probably be tried.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> We see early parallels to this in the issue of open 
              source and "digital rights management" routines. The idea 
              of outlawing Open Source (because it can't be locked down) even 
              gets kicked around from time to time. It seems likely that an open 
              source that could result in new weapons might be even more likely 
              to trigger this kind of response.</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Historically, Open Source has been a huge source of 
              innovation. Open source applied to molecular manufacturing could 
              result in new weapons, but also in new defenses. Shutting down Open 
              Source might not reduce the weapons much, but it probably would 
              reduce the development of defenses. We should think very carefully 
              before we reduced our <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to design new defenses. That said, 
              you may well be right that a combination of government and corporate 
              interests would work together to successfully eliminate Open Source-type 
              development.</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> What would you say are your top concerns about how nanofactory 
              technology might develop?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> Our biggest concern is that molecular manufacturing 
              will be a source of immense <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> power. A medium-sized or larger 
              nation that was the sole possessor of the technology would be a 
              superpower, with a strong likelihood of becoming the superpower 
              if they were sufficiently ruthless. This implies geopolitical instability 
              in the form of accelerating arms races and preemptive strikes. For 
              several reasons, a nanofactory-based arms race looks less stable 
              than the nuclear arms race was.</p>
<p>Related to the military concern is a tangle of security concerns. 
              If molecular manufacturing proliferates, it will become relatively 
              easy to build a wide range of high-tech automated weaponry. Accountability 
              may decrease even as destructive power increases. The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, 
              with its viruses, <a class="thought" href="entries/spam_entry.html">spam</a>, spyware, and phishing, provides a partial 
              preview of what we might expect. It could be very difficult to police 
              such a society without substantial weakening of civil rights and 
              even human rights.</p>
<p>Economic disruption is a likely consequence of widespread use of 
              molecular manufacturing. On the one hand, we would have an abundance 
              of production capacity able to build high-performance products at 
              minimal expense. On the other hand, this could threaten a lot of 
              today's jobs, from manufacturing to <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a> to mineral extraction.</p>
<p>Environmental damage could result from widespread use of inexpensive 
              products. Although products filling today's purposes could be made 
              more efficient with molecular manufacturing, future applications 
              such as supersonic and ballistic transport may demand far more energy 
              than we use today.</p>
<p>Another major risk associated with molecular manufacturing comes 
              from not using it for positive purposes. Artificial scarcities&#8212;legal 
              restrictions&#8212;have been applied to lifesaving medicines. Similar 
              restrictions on molecular manufacturing, whether in the form of 
              military <a class="thought" href="entries/classification_entry.html">classification</a>, unnecessary safety regulations, or explicit 
              intellectual property regulation, could allow millions of people 
              to die unnecessarily.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> We know from the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> restrictions/"piracy" 
              debate that technical limitations on copying, etc., do an adequate 
              job of preventing regular folks from duplicating movies, software 
              and such, whether for illicit reasons (passing a copy to a friend) 
              or otherwise (making a backup or other "fair use"), while 
              doing little to prevent real IP pirates from duping off thousands 
              of copies to sell on the street in Shanghai or the like.</p>
<p>In short, there's every reason to believe that top-down efforts 
              to stymie the illegal/illicit/irresponsible use of nanofactories 
              will be only marginally-effective, at best, while driving the worst 
              stuff deep underground and preventing regular citizens from using 
              their nanofactories in ways that would be beneficial and not significantly 
              harmful.</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> It would be premature to dismiss all top-down regulation 
              as ineffective. At the same time, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in humanitarian 
              and other benefits from excessive regulation is one of CRN's primary 
              concerns. It is certainly true that regulation will impose a significant 
              cost in lost opportunities. However, because there are so many different 
              types of harm that could be done with a nanofactory, we are not 
              ready to say that all regulation would be undesirable.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to apply "fine-grained relinquishment" 
              (Kurzweil's term) to a general-purpose technology like nanofactories. 
              However, we will probably have to achieve this, because both blanket 
              permissiveness and blanket restrictions will impose extremely high 
              costs and risks.</p>
<p>As we have said before, there will be no simple solutions. We will 
              need a combination of both top-down and emergent approaches.</p>
<p><b>WC:</b> I've been a pretty vocal advocate of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/000404.html" target="_blank">openness 
              as a tool for countering dangerous uses</a>. It's a bit counter-intuitive, 
              I admit, but there's real precedent for its value. Most experts 
              see free/open source software, for example, as being more secure 
              than closed, proprietary <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. And the treatment for SARS (to cite 
              a non-computer example) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621164401/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003648.html" target="_blank">emerged 
              directly from open global access to the virus genome</a>.</p>
<p>In both cases, the key is the widespread availability of the underlying 
              "code" to both professional and interested amateurs. The 
              potential increase in possible harmful use of that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is, 
              at least so far, demonstrably outweighed by the preventative use.</p>
<p>What do you think of an open approach to nanotechnology as a means 
              of heading off disasters?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> In a false dichotomy between totally closed and totally 
              open, the open approach would seem to increase the dangers posed 
              by hobbyists and criminals. A totally closed approach, assuming 
              no one in power was insanely stupid, probably would not lead to 
              certain kinds of danger such as hobbyist-built free-range self-replicators, 
              the so-called <a class="thought" href="entries/grey_goo_entry.html">grey goo</a>.</p>
<p>I don't think we can count on no one in power being insanely stupid, 
              however. Realistically, even a totally closed, locked-down, planet-wide 
              dictator approach would not be safe.</p>
<p>A partially closed approach, where Open Source was criminalized 
              but bootleg or independent nanofactories were available, would be 
              prone to danger from criminals and rebellious hobbyists&#8212;and 
              by the way, the world still needs a lot more research to determine 
              just how extreme that danger is. An open approach probably would 
              not increase the danger much versus a partially closed approach, 
              and would certainly increase our ability to deal with the danger.</p>
<p>Remember Ben Franklin's adage: Three can keep a secret, if two 
              are dead. There would be a substantial danger of disastrous abuse 
              even with a mere one thousand people or groups having access to 
              the technology (and the rest of the six billion at their mercy). 
              It's not certain that the danger would be very much worse with a 
              million or even a billion people empowered.</p>

<p><b>WC:</b> Closing on a more positive note, what would you say 
              are your biggest hopes about how this kind of technology might be 
              applied? In other words, what does a world of responsible nanotechnology 
              look like?</p>
<p><b>CRN:</b> We would like to see a world in which security and 
              geopolitical concerns are addressed proactively and skillfully, 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to maximize liberty without allowing any devastating uses.</p>
<p>We would like to see a world in which the ubiquity of tradeoffs 
              is recognized, and where consequences are neither dismissed nor 
              exaggerated. Regulation should be appropriate to the extent of the 
              various risks. The drawbacks of inaction should be considered along 
              with the risks and problems of action.</p>
<p>We would like to see a world in which everyone has access to at 
              least a minimal molecular manufacturing capacity. The computer revolution 
              has shown that inventiveness is maximized by a combination of commercial 
              and open source development, and open source is a good generator 
              of free <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> products when the cost of production is tiny.</p>
