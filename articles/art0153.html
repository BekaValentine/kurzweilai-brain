<div class="TeaserText">We're all genetically programmed to die, but advances in nanomedicine are expected to allow for "radical life extension" by 2050. Meanwhile, there's cryostasis--freezing the body immediately after death with a view toward resuscitation in the future.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published in the book <i>The Baby Boomer's Guide to Living Forever</i>, 2000. Published on KurzweilAI.net April 3, 2001.</p><h1>What About Us?</h1><p>Now that the oldest of my own generation, the "baby" boomers, are on the verge of becoming "geezer" boomers, many of us are finding it ever harder to deny the disquieting intimations of our own <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>. We have been forced to admit that, so far at least, nobody has ever managed to get out of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> alive. We have started to look over our shoulders, perhaps a little anxiously, to see if anything can be done. Certainly there must be some answer, some rescue, some scientific miracle that can save us from the inevitable trip down Shady Lane.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that all <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, literature and <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, as well as all of our personal experience, tells us that there is no way out. <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> seems certain. Even by following the healthiest of diets, a lifelong commitment to exercise, the most powerful nutrients money can buy and the best positive attitude imaginable, the sad truth seems to be that eventually every last one of us will grow old and die.</p>
<p>Even as advances in anti-aging <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> begin to forestall the ultimate ends of our lives, the next few decades will be particularly critical. Even with the acceleration in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, many of us will still lose out to passing illness. Until dramatic technological advances are available, the twin dangers of fatal illness and accidental <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> will continue to dog our heels. For the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> at least, the specter of premature <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> will still loom to confound and confront us.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> into anti-aging <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> will bring about dramatic breakthroughs in the years ahead, yet the aging process will probably not yield to any single magic treatment or remedy. Several decades may pass before the combined advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> and proteomics, availability of prosthetic and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> replacement organs, breakthroughs in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, and perfection of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>-cerebral <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> bring about the effective end of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a>-As-We-Know-It.</p>
<p>A few decades from now, many of us could find ourselves hanging on for dear <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in a very weakened and debilitated state. With all of the sentimentality of a bulldozer for the forest it is about to destroy, the aging process will continue to decimate and erode each of us. In the end, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what we do, many of us will still succumb.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the near-term at least, we remain condemned to follow the script of our ancestors. We will continue to deteriorate over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Our bodies are, in fact, <i><a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med</i> to dry up and wear down. From the moment of our conception, a timer begins hammering out the iambic cadence of our predestined <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> of our bodies contains genetic instructions causing normal function to deteriorate at some preordained <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Each of our cells is eventually scheduled to begin an elegantly orchestrated process of self-destruction.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> has been designed for survival of the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> and gives not a fiddler's damn about any individual. The bottom line is that as far as the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> is concerned, each and every one of us humans is pretty much outdated and unnecessary by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we're out of our twenties. That same cocky attitude I know I held a mere two decades ago or so ("Never trust anyone over 30") has come back to haunt me now. What goes around has come around. Mother <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> is a cruel taskmistress, and Father <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> isn't much better, to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Be fruitful and multiply, we are told, then get lost. That's why our own bodies begin to deteriorate just as soon as we've mixed our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> with another of our genus.<sup>1</sup> Once we've sown our seeds and propagated, we rapidly become obsolete in terms of the survival of our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. We are given a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> more <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to help rear our young--at least to the point that they can survive without us. Yet, it doesn't seem fair.</p>
<p>"What about us?" we cry.</p>
<p>"Who cares?" booms the Immutable Reply.</p>
<p>Unlike all other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, we possess powers of reflection and contemplation, which ultimately lead to existential fears. We seek a way out, some manner to defeat <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, to avoid oblivion. Self preservation is arguably the most fundamental drive of all living creatures, and it is especially poignant, of course, to us humans, burdened as we are with the realization that, indeed, we are destined to die. Eternal <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is our "impossible <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>."</p>
<p>The practice of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> arose to cure illness, to repair injury, to ease suffering. But despite the nobility of the endeavor, <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> has ultimately failed in every case, and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> has always won. Since the beginning of recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, humans have turned to the only weapon they had with which they felt able to defeat <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>--they looked upwards, to the heavens above. By incorporating a belief <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> into <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> that included a promise of eternal <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, some of the <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>'s sting was neutralized. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> has come up with a different notion of how this might happen: heaven itself for some, nirvana for others; Valhalla, the Elysian Fields, The Happy Hunting Grounds ... and countless individual variations of those themes.<sup>2</sup>
</p><h1>Never Give Up</h1><p>Over the course of the past few decades, however, scientists have begun to theorize that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span may not be as immutably fixed at six score as once <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. There is now talk that the lives of individuals now alive may possibly be extended for hundreds or even thousands of years.<br>

</p>
<p>While the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>" may sound far-fetched, from a practical standpoint, I see no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why humans shouldn't be able to live <i>indefinitely</i>. Just a few decades from now, we may see the length of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> existence wind upward through more and more interesting times until <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> simply fades into the distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>We have grown accustomed to the idea that medical discoveries will be able to cure all disease. It is just a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. We are no longer astounded by the idea of artificial joints and limbs, or organ transplants. News of medical "miracles" that can not only keep us alive, but keep us active and in good health far longer than previously believed, is daily newspaper fare.</p>
<p>We've come to <i>expect</i> that eventually medical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> will solve almost all of our health problems. There even seems to be some growing public <i>impatience</i> these days that modern <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> has not yet been able to find a cure for AIDS, many forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, heart disease, etc. This has become especially poignant to those of us who can no longer consider ourselves young. For as we get closer each day to what appears to be the top of the mountain, the lightning strikes seem to be occurring closer together and with greater fury--and they have even begun to hit some of <i>us</i>! Funding cures for these illnesses has become critical for our own continued existence and well-being.</p>
<p>It is becoming a widespread belief that with our exponentially increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, the determination and dedication of our health care professionals and our vast material resources that we should be able to accomplish this task. Our own desperate need to <i>have</i> it be so will somehow <i>create</i> the ways and means to enable us to live longer, healthier lives and ultimately, not have to die.</p>
<p>In fact, a growing number of scientists believe that this possibility is within our grasp. Many biologists, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers and doctors have stated that advances in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> (MNT) could provide exactly the tools we will need to repair, rejuvenate and preserve our own bodies so that they might last a <i>very</i> long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> is defined simply as <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering at the molecular or even atomic level. The idea is to create <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can manipulate atoms one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, so that we can place them in the right position to create any <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> that we wish.</p>
<p>As <a class="thought" href="entries/merkle_entry.html">Ralph C. Merkle</a>, Ph.D., a pioneering thinker in the field, puts it, "We are nearing an era when we will be able to build virtually any structure that is specified in atomic detail and which is consistent with the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>." That means that we'll be able to create anything from a steak to a grape, a diamond to a donut, a new pair of shoes to a new pair of lungs--anything. Almost for nothing to boot!</p>
<p>There are a few minimal applications of MNT available today. Even so, the most optimistic believers predict the major medical applications of MNT, won't be here for at least 25 years--and possibly not for 50 years or even more.</p>
<p>By far the most hopeful, authoritative prediction we've been able to find comes from Dr. Richard Smalley, the 1996 Nobel Prize winner in <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, who has predicted that <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will be manufacturing "cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s" by 2010. But, it will take at least a couple of decades after that, scientists say, before we will be capable of manufacturing nanomachines capable of performing <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-giving procedures.</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a>, the first of a three volume series on the medical applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> by Dr. <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a>, numerous medical applications of MNT are suggested. As just one example, consider the prospects for the "respirocyte." These <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> spheres would float alongside of red blood cells in the blood stream. Under normal circumstances, these respirocytes would store <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> at a very high concentration. This <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> would be available to the body under emergency circumstances.</p>
<p>Let's say a patient were to suffer a massive heart attack or any other potentially fatal <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. As soon as the individual's cardiac arrest monitor came on (built into our wristwatch, of course), the respirocytes would immediately begin to release their stored <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> and simultaneously begin to remove <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide from the body. Early designs indicate that these very simple circulating <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s could keep an individual alive for several hours, until definite medical care could be administered. (In the case of an otherwise fatal heart attack, this might involve prosthetic heart replacement.) This example is only the barest glimmer of what nanomedicne has to offer!</p>
<p>All of this is astounding, to say the least, and, clearly will transform <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>-As-We-Know-It. Many of the details, repercussions, proposed methodologies and so on will be discussed in the following chapter, but those of us older than 40 years of age have a more pressing concern. How can we live long enough to take advantage of these upcoming miracles?</p>
<p>The requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> needed for "radical <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a>" should be available sometime between 2025 and 2050--<i>if</i> all goes according to plan. But for those of us born in the mid-1950's or earlier, that's cutting the edge of oblivion a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> too close to the bone. Many of us are going to find ourselves right on the cusp. The main focus of this book has been, in fact, teaching us what we can do to help buy a few more of these potentially critical years.</p>
<p>How existentially frustrating and galling to die just a few years before <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> comes up with the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to keep everyone else going forever--so close and yet so far.</p>
<p>We have mentioned leapfrogging--the notion that if one can live to 80, one might reap the benefits that will extend <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to 90; from 90, we might live to 110, from 110 to 150, and then who knows. The bottom line is this: <b>Sometime during the 21st century the day should come at last, arguably the most wondrous day since creation, when </b><a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a><b> gets a taste of its own </b><a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a><b>.</b> But until this day of near infinite joy, The Grim Reaper will still come for us, tap us on the shoulder and take us away. What then?</p>
<p>All is still not lost. Not by a long shot! We can be like the frog in the cartoon and "Never give up." There is one last chance at continued survival even for people who have "died." I have mentioned that the line separating <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> has begun to fade, and that, in many cases, <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> comes simply because it seems inevitable and that there seems to be little merit in continuing the resuscitation efforts.</p>
<p>In addition, we recall an adage from the Emergency Room: "There is no such thing as a patient being cold and dead." By ensuring that a patient is cold right when they die, by definition, they are not really dead. This is the essence of "<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis" (also historically termed "<a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a>"), and, as defined by the Alcor <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">Life Extension</a> Foundation, is "the practice of maintaining patients currently classed as legally 'dead' at extremely low temperatures for treatment by <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>."<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>Under usual circumstances, our current definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> simply means that the parties concerned with the patient's welfare (family, physicians, clergy, patient) have agreed that resuscitation efforts are no longer likely to be successful. Therefore, these measures are terminated and the patient is allowed to die.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> of cyostasis, the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> is that the resuscitation efforts are simply not likely to be successful with <i>present day technologies</i>. Therefore, resuscitation with a view toward full restoration of normal function is just interrupted <i>temporarily.</i> The focus of the resuscitation effort is directed instead toward stabilizing the patient so that the present disease process is not allowed to cause any further damage. It is planned that full resuscitation with a view toward definitive cure will be resumed at some <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. This will be at a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> date when medical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has advanced to the point of being able to cure the presently fatal disease process, as well as to reverse the added damage from the stabilization procedure itself. Patients in cryostasis are "legally dead," however, from a fundamental scientific standpoint they remain "potentially alive."</p><h1>The Fundamental Theorem of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a></h1><p>Ralph Merkle, PhD, a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and cryostasis pioneer as well as a Director of the Alcor <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">Life Extension</a> Foundation, looks at it this way: "Cryonic suspension is a method of stabilizing the condition of someone who is terminally ill, so that they can be transported to the medical care facilities that will be available in the late 21st or 22nd century."</p>
<p>Notice that Dr. Merkle regards persons declared legally dead today to be merely "terminally ill" in the larger scheme of things. What we regard as "dead" today will merely be "seriously ill" tomorrow. In the words of Jerry Lemler, M.D., medical director of Alcor, "<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> should not be equated with a lack of heartbeat or absence of breathing, even though, unfortunately, the term is still used in this archaic fashion. '<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a>' is a state that should be reserved to apply to those individuals whose <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> functions cannot ever be reversed to restore <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Period!" Consider what I have named <b>The Fundamental Theorem of </b><a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a><b> </b><a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a><b> (FTIM)</b>: what we now call "<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>" is (or will soon turn out to be) just another disease.--in many cases, anyway.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> is filled with numerous, encouraging examples of how other diseases had once been uniformly fatal to earlier generations, but turned out to be completely curable later on. Tens of thousands of plague victims in the Middle Ages would have easily survived with <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s that are readily available today. Patients declared "dead" as recently as a few decades ago could have been "brought back" today with the equipment and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> readily available in almost every emergency room in the modern world. Currently, people are saved every day even without equipment of any kind whatsoever, simply through proper application of CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). A few years ago these people would have died, because no one knew what to do. The same thing will happen again in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>The First Corollary to the Fundamental Theorem of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> states that the disease we now call <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> will soon be amenable to "treatment" in many cases by soon-to-be available therapies. Thanks to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a>, genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, therapeutic cloning and other advances, many scientists predict the eradication of <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and many other currently incurable diseases within the next 20 years or so. This is our hope for the <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. One of tools we may need to employ to enable us to take advantage of these <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments is <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">Cryopreservation</a>--Is--Cool</h1><p>This is also the view of Robert <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.W. Ettinger, the man regarded as the founder of the early <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> movement. From this starting point, our current, more sophisticated methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a> (or <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> as it is called) have developed. The early <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> movement began in 1962 with the private publication of the first version of Ettinger's book, <i>The Prospect of </i><a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a>.<sup>5</sup> "In all probability, you'd close your eyes, sick and old, in a present-day hospital bed, and you'll wake up, young and healthy, to a new and very long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in an amazing near-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> world."</p>
<p>That was Ettinger's initial ideal, but there were a few rather substantial technical glitches that needed to be overcome. The most pressing problems involved the freezing process itself, which typically causes major and, often, irreparable damage to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tissue at the temperatures used for <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a>. Frozen tissues have a tendency to form cracks and split. The use of "cryoprotectants" to prevent major fissures of this sort became a major pursuit.</p>
<p>An even more difficult problem to solve was that of freezing damage to the individual cells. When the body undergoes the freezing process, water is drawn from each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. This causes the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> to shrink, and unfrozen <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s surrounding the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> can puncture the membrane of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> wall.</p>
<p>These harmful effects are diminished by the process of replacing blood with cryoprotectant fluids, which inhibit or reduce the formation of the harmful ice crystals. The cryoprotectant used most successfully to date has been glycerol, a colorless, syrupy liquid made from fats and oils. It has numerous industrial applications, including everything from skin lotions to explosives.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> involving the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for better cryoprotectants is ongoing at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. In fact, the largest <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis organization in the world, Alcor, suspended their first patient by a newer process called "vitrification" rather than freezing just a few months ago. Vitrification is a process similar to freezing, but it involves cooling living tissue in such a way that it enters a glass-like rather than ice-like state. By doing so, almost all of the freezing damage described above is avoided. It is the feeling of most experts in the field that the long-term damage resulting from vitrification will be dramatically less than that from freezing.</p>
<p>Some recent experiments have shown that organs from small <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s have shown some preservation of function after cryovitrification and subsequent thawing. Cryovitrification of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> organs and other medical applications is on the horizon.</p>
<p>Even so, there are many who still feel that because harmful effects from the freezing or even vitrification processes are unavoidable with current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis is a waste of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and money at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> causes the baby to be thrown out with the bath water. These critics are losing site of the fact that the entire foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis depends upon <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> medical technologies. We don't need to repair the damage inherent in the freezing process today. Our present responsibility is simply to place the patient into cryostasis with as little damage as possible. The medical technologies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will be likely to have cures for the fatal diseases of today, as well as effective repair processes for the damage done by the freezing or cryovitrification process.<sup>6</sup>
</p>
<p>Whether present methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis will ultimately be successful or not has to do with probabilities and statistics. Some experts predict that patients in cryostasis awaiting the repair and resuscitation technologies of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> medical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> have only a 1 in 1000 chance. I don't look at it this way. It's either 100% or zero. Another way to look at it is as follows: if you don't undergo cryostasis, you will most assuredly never become repairable at a later <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, since further decay and deterioration have taken place. On the other hand, if you try it and it works, you will have the chance to be returned to a functioning condition. What have you got to lose? By funding one's cryostasis with <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance, I figure, depending on your age, about $10-75 a month.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Cryostasis Entry Procedure</h1><p>Right now there are really only two organizations that have the personnel, <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and facilities to initiate and maintain <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis: Alcor <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">Life Extension</a> Institute (Alcor) and The <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">Cryonics</a> Institute (CI). There are major differences between these two organizations in the way that patients are readied for entry into cryostasis. Alcor utilizes licensed health professionals to take charge of the patient every step of the way from clinical <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> to suspension, while CI outsources this work to funeral parlor operators. As a result, prices differ from $28,000 at CI to $50,000-150,00 at Alcor.</p>
<p>In addition, one needs to bear in mind that to effectively place a patient into cryostasis requires sophisticated procedures, <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s, and equipment. This is not something that can be easily arranged at the last minute. Before any organization will consider allowing an individual admission to their facilities, prior arrangements are required. Consent forms need to be signed and financial arrangements made. This is why, at least at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, nothing can be done in cases where people die suddenly or unexpectedly without having made prior arrangements.</p>
<p>But, let's assume for now that a patient has made the appropriate arrangements and is prepared to enter cryostasis. To obtain the best results from the rescue and eventual <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a> operations, it is desirable to have a few days' notice of the patient's impending demise. This enables technicians to be on "stand by" at the bedside and ready to start the cooling procedure at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>Damage to the body after legal <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> occurs quickly under normal above-freezing conditions. The <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> before irreparable harm occurs is measured in hours, however, not minutes. Then again, we don't have days either. This means that if someone dies in the wilderness, or anywhere that would prevent technicians from getting to them within a half-day or so, the options for cryostasis are drastically reduced. Accidental deaths, such as those associated with fires or explosions, where the body or the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, in particular, is irretrievably damaged or destroyed, are relative contraindications to suspension.</p>
<p>As the popularity of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis increases, which should occur as more people become aware of this possibility and the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> improves, options for cryostasis will no doubt extend to more remote areas. For now, however, the urban hospital or hospice is the optimum location for <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to cryosuspension <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>The first criteria that must be met before the cryotransport team can go to work is that the patient must be pronounced legally dead. According to the book published by the Alcor Foundation, <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">Cryonics</a><i>--Reaching for Tomorrow</i>: "In actual medical practice, legal <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> seldom means that the final basis of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has yet been lost, only that a qualified authority sees no value in continuing to support <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> with present <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>."</p>
<p>In most jurisdictions, the difference between clinical <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> and legal <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> isn't much. In the first case, absence of respiration and heartbeat, in the other, a piece of paper signed by a physician or mortician. That's it. Once the patient is declared legally dead, then the cryotransport team can get to work.</p>
<p>At the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, the patient should have something on their person, such as a medical-alert style bracelet on the wrist, which identifies them as a member of such-and-such cryostasis organization and which also advises health care personnel as to how the organization can be reached. In the case of the Alcor <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">Life Extension</a> Foundation, the ID bracelet also provides advice about beginning the initial suspension protocol, and gives phone numbers to alert Alcor's central laboratories. These numbers are manned 24 hours per day with personnel who can initiate rescue <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s including physicians to advise the hospital personnel on initial protocols and procedures. In the case of CI, instructions are to make contact with a local mortician to begin the cooling procedure.</p>
<p>As soon as the heart stops beating, blood stops flowing and <i>ischemic</i> damage, which is tissue injury caused by lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>, begins to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> in. This is why cryonicists would like to be able to begin the suspension just <i>before</i> a patient is declared legally dead. That way the last few beats of the patient's heart could be used to circulate anticoagulants and other important medications. Current laws do not permit that such measures be taken prior to <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, however. Performing any interventions <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> freezing on even a "barely-living" person is still regarded as murder.</p>
<p>Therefore, as soon as possible <i>after</i> legal <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> has been declared, the cryotransport team begins the suspension protocol. At Alcor, the following procedures are implemented as soon as possible:</p>
<p>1) Anticoagulants are injected into the blood stream to minimize clotting. Other protective <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s are utilized to combat <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> membrane breakdown, stabilize blood pH, prevent the formation of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l colonies, minimize capillary leakage, block calcium and other unwanted ions from entering the cells, halt shivering reflexes which can speed up metabolism, prevent free radical damage, and in other ways prevent much of the catastrophic damage to tissues which will otherwise take place.</p>
<p>2) CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is instituted as a mechanism of circulating the medications administered. If the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> since cardiac arrest is short, respiratory support with pure <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> is utilized as well. Ideally, a bi-directional, hi-impulse "Thumper" is used to closely approach the circulatory efficiency of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> heart.</p>
<p>3) Initial cooling of the patient is begun, with the application of cold packs, ice water or a cooling blanket. Partial immersion of the patient in a mixture of crushed ice and water is best, particularly where the ice water is recirculated and either sprayed or otherwise delivered to surface areas of the body, so that the core temperature of the patient drops rapidly. Every 10 degree <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a> drop of temperature reduces metabolism by 50% (75% in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>), dramatically increasing the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> before the damage caused by <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> lack causes irreversible <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, which takes anywhere from eight to twelve hours, technicians monitor body temperature, the rate of assimilation of the cryoprotective solution and other dynamics.</p>
<p>When these are complete, the technicians move the patient to a facility where further stabilization can be carried out. By means of extracorporeal circulation, blood is replaced by an "organ preservation solution," essentially identical to that used by organ transplant teams. This stabilizes the integrity of the patient's circulatory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. By now the temperature of the patient has been reduced to about 10 degrees <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>.</p>
<p>Following this initial stabilization, the patient is air-shipped to a central station. There, the final stages of preparation for cryogenic temperatures are completed. Additional cryoprotective agents are gradually added to the organ preservation fluids over a period of several hours, while technicians monitor body temperature, the rate of assimilation of the cryoprotective solution and other dynamics.</p>
<p>In cases where vitrification is to be carried out, specific proprietary, licensed compounds are used, including synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> "freeze blockers" which inhibit crystal formation between --50 to --100 degrees <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, the range where much of the freeze damage typically occurs. The difference between the best conventional cryoprotectants and the new compounds is dramatic. In one demonstration, conducted by the cryobiologists who developed these new compounds, two flasks, one with and one without these new "freeze blockers" were cooled through the zone of danger. Without the freeze blockers, the formerly clear fluid turned to a milky solid, indicating countless trillions of ice crystals. With the freeze blockers, it was like looking into a transparent solid of glass.</p>
<p>At the end of this second stage of cryoprotection, again describing the new procedure of vitrification, the patient will be at about --10 degrees <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Circulation through the vascular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> at this temperature will still continue, but very slowly. As the ideal, target concentrations of the protective compounds are achieved, it is necessary that further "cooldown" with subsequent vitrification be brought about very rapidly.</p>
<p>Beginning at a temperature of about --10 degrees <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>, the temperature of the gas surrounding the patient (almost pure <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>) is dropped suddenly to -130 degrees <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. The gas is circulated rapidly, as if the patient were in a strong wind. The core temperature of the patient's body drops at the rate of nearly one degree per minute, and is much, much faster at the surface. This is one of the keys to succesful vitrification--very rapid cooling. If the procedure is done properly, no ice crystals will form. It will take only a few hours for the procedure to be essentially complete, and the patient will then gradually settle to a temperature at which there are no more changes of a biochemical kind, even over very long periods <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Protection is complete.</p>
<p>In the final stage of cooling, the patient is transferred into other containers and placed in contact with liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> vapors for the "final descent" to -196 degrees Centigrade. This takes an additional five to seven days. One technical problem that remains is that on the way to these colder temperatures, thermal stress cracks can form. This occurs whether vitrification is used or not. Hopefully, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies will soon make it possible to maintain patients at higher, safer temperatures or a mechanism developed to avoid these thermal fissures. Much remains to be done before even the best procedures of today are declared to be the early headwaters of true suspended animation, but rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is being made.</p>
<p>At this point the patient, wrapped in super-strong shrink wrap, is immersed in liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>--sometimes in the company of as many as three other colleagues--inside a tank that resembles a very large thermos bottle, with two layers and a <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> in between.</p>
<p>And there the patients remain--suspended in liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>, kept as intact as possible until such <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as medical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has some certainty that they can be repaired and revived.</p><h1>But Can It Work?</h1><p>The bottom line, of course, boils down to one very <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> question: Can it really work? Can once-viable living tissue be frozen solid or vitrified into a glass-like state, hard as a rock, and then be defrosted and revived?</p>
<p>Nobody knows for sure. Currently, it can not. If <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> lives up to its promise--and to date there is nothing in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> that precludes it--then any <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and any tissue should be able to be repaired.</p>
<p>Even putting <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> aside for the moment, there have been many cases where living organs or even whole organisms have been frozen and after being thawed out exhibited normal functions in important respects. Experiments have included <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, some eels, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> tissue, some small <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian organs, even <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> sperm cells. In addition, there are many documented cases of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s that were suspended in liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>--for anywhere from two months to seven years--and then reintroduced into the womb, carried to term and who are alive today.</p><h1>Living in Glass Houses--Vitrification</h1><p>The techniques for protecting cells and tissue from thermal injury (frostbite) are improving every day. The most recent technique involves "vitrification," where as mentioned above, tissues are transformed into glasslike solids as the temperature falls. This tends to stop the formation of ice crystals, which are what penetrate and destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells during freezing. Alcor performed the first <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> vitrification of one of its members in the fall of 2000. Thanks to recent technological advances, vitrification is now being offered as an option to all "neurosuspension"<sup>7</sup> patients at Alcor.</p>
<p>Worked on indefatigably by Dr. Greg Fahy for the past twenty years, the fruits of his labors regarding improved <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> techniques and vitrification are now finding clinical application.<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<p>It is anticipated that even more dramatic advances in vitrification will be available in the next few years. Once again, I would like to reiterate the central theme of this book. By remaining alive and as healthy as possible for at long as possible, we increase our chances of being able to take advantage of these technological advances. Therefore, even if we aren't able to survive until the coming <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> during our current <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle, by following The Ten Pillars of Health, we hope at least to improve our chances of living long enough to take advantage of improved cryostasis preservation technologies such as vitrification.</p>
<p>Therefore, following the principles embodied in The Ten Pillars of Health makes an enormous amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> even if an individual is quite elderly right now. If we increase our chances of remaining alive for even a few extra months or years, we can dramatically improve our prospects for achieving extreme longevity by availing ourselves of the advances in vitrification right around the corner. <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">Immortality</a> is available to everyone, not only the young, the healthy and the lucky. For the very old, the unhealthy and the unlucky, there is the cryostasis option. With vitrification now commercially available, one's prospects for successful <i>resuscitation</i> and return to vibrant health at a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> have never been better. In this way, virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> or at least the opportunity for extreme longevity is available to almost everyone.</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">Soul</a>--A Fly in the Soup?</h1><p>Still, some other questions remain. For instance, upon your return, who will you be, really? And who will you have been during those decades that you were in cryostasis, in a state in which there was no <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> activity whatsoever--presumably no <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s, no feelings, no dreams, no <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, not anything?</p>
<p>You're certainly not alive, but are you ... dead?</p>
<p>The inevitable question arises as to the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a>. What happens to that non-physical essence of each of that many believe is the core of our being? Each of us has our own answer to this question, and this answer may, in fact, determine whether or not we would even consider cryostasis as an option. This is not a question that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> can answer, but is rather a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of personal belief.</p>
<p>Yet there's no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, as far as I can see, to dismiss cryostasis as evil or bad in a religious <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. After all, these incredible brains we have came from G-d, and must be part of the divine plan. And aren't we obligated, therefore, to be the best we can be and to use these brains to the best of our ability? The Bible tells us that Methuselah lived almost one thousand years, (969 to be exact), so why can't we?</p>
<p>Still, it's one thing to <i>want</i> to live forever, but it could be considered quite a preposterous vanity actually to take steps to do so. One is reminded of the tragic outcomes of Dr. Frankenstein, Dr. Faustus and other mortals who presumed to defy <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. Their attempts at <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> did not end well for them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as we have said before, humans are born tinkerers, constantly working at improving our lot in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Upon initial discussion, many of our most profound technological advances have been ridiculed by the general populace, condemned as blasphemous by the pious and largely dismissed by experts in the field--until the experiments are uniformly successful and the advances are in place. Then all the nay-sayers find ways to make the proper adjustments, and gird their loins to oppose the next imaginative idea.</p>
<p>Of course, as the ads for investment opportunities are forced to remind us, past performance is no indication of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> success. The fact that some ideas once regarded as foolish have turned out to be sound doesn't necessarily mean that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis will someday receive widespread acceptance. But in the present case, more and more reputable scientists are opening their minds to the possibilities that it just might work.</p><h1>Is This Really What We Want?</h1><p>For my own part, I believe that all the glitches are going to get worked out with respect to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> (MNT). Even so, I am not all that certain that I would much enjoy <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the world of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> after a lapse of several decades spent in a vat of liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a>. The world may turn into a place to which I might never grow accustomed.<sup>9</sup> Things may become a little too weird. Nevertheless, there's no way any of us will ever get to know if we'll be able to cross that bridge <i>unless</i> we come to that bridge.</p>
<p>Without <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> and MNT, for some of us there will be little chance that we will even get close to that shore, let alone needing to wonder about crossing any bridges. If things work out such that we actually do make it over to the "other side," however, but find that we can't relate at all, I guess we'll just hang out with all the other "old-timers" like ourselves who can't relate either.</p>
<p> "He's just an old hippie who don't know what to do,</p>
<p>Whether to hang on to the old ways, or grab on to the new..."</p>
<p>Almost everyone I talk to about this agree about one thing. They, too, would <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> to see what's going to happen next. Everyone wants to know if the world will be a place TDF (to die for) or not. For my own part, I don't know the answer to this better than anyone else, but I <i>am</i> willing to die trying.</p><h1>Why Isn't the Idea of Cryostasis More Popular?</h1><p>As I proceeded with my <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> into the subject of cryostasis, I had occasion to consider this option from both a theoretical and a personal point of view. Much to my surprise, I discovered that the number of people who have chosen this alternative and are currently in suspension is only a few hundred worldwide, despite the fact that it has been available for over three decades. These few hundred souls represent "a spit in the ocean" of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in which we swim. I found it interesting that it took several years for me to "think about it" before actually arranging for my own suspension.</p>
<p>How can this be possible, given the fact that I am actually one of the few people I know who really believes that cryostasis has a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able chance of working? What is the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process that leads one to open wide the door to immortal <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, then simply stand there gawking, yet not walk on through?</p>
<p>I have given considerable <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> as to <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s behind my own procrastination. I think a short discussion of this topic may be of value, as I believe it may help others with their decision making. But, don't get me wrong. I don't think this is a decision to be taken lightly, and I have come up with several <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s why many people might be reluctant to make such a move.</p>
<p>First of all, making preparations for one's <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a> forces us to confront our own <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> in a very real, almost a palpable, way. This is discomforting on even the best of days.</p>
<p>Secondly, freezing one's body with a view toward perpetual <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, at least at the current <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, appears a solipsistic, even a narcissistic, act.</p>
<p>Thirdly, almost no one, including most reputable scientists working in the field, believes that it has any chance of working.</p>
<p>Finally, it is hard to give up completely and utterly on the status quo. <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a>, being one of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>'s "bookends" is a fundamental part of the status quo. But just as <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>-As-We-Know-It is just about over, so, too, is <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a>-As-We-Know-It.</p><h1>The Comfort of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a></h1><p>All of us have been raised with the "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>" that in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we will grow old, our bodies will deteriorate and we have a good chance of finishing our days in the agony of some terrible illness so bad that <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> may come as a relief. Dismal as these prospects may be, they provide us with boundaries, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind loves closure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are dreary prospects. To help us deal a little better with their finality, as well as to provide a balm for our utter helplessness and hopelessness, <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> is available to give us peace. The blanket of peace that deep religious faith can provide is a wonder to behold and a blessing to possess. For better or worse, and I suspect with a considerable measure of each, it is also no longer an option for many. The problem is that we must somehow be able to suspend rational <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and accept "on faith" the presuppositions required as part of the "belief <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>" for most <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>s.</p>
<p>Religious faith is pretty much "right <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>" activity. It isn't logical; in fact, most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it defies <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>. It supplies answers where <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> seems to find only more questions. Yet, most people have the faith that, somehow or another, thanks to their <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, they are going to live forever. Living "forever" here on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, the goal of cryonicists, isn't really necessary.</p>
<p>But, in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, "belief" in cryosuspension is a type of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> in its own right. Like most <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>s, it requires that certain things be taken "on faith," and it promises a payoff of eternal <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> to its followers. You have to pay to belong, and it is even mistrusted, if not actually persecuted, by non-believers. There are a number of similarities to the early days of a new <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>.</p><h1>If Gold Should Rust ...</h1><p>I subscribe to an <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> newsgroup devoted to this topic of cryostasis.<sup>10</sup> Many of the philosophers, scientists and other interested parties who participate in these discussions have devoted considerable <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to performing <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in this field, trying to increase the chances that cryostasis will work. Quite a few of <i>them</i>, however, have not yet taken steps to insure their own <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a>. As it is said, "If gold should rust, what is iron to do?" If the people at the very top of the heap don't even seem to believe in what they are doing, why should any of the rest of us? I think it simply boils down to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>I don't think these people lack faith in cryostasis, rather I think it's similar to people's reaction to <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance. It's something we don't want to think about unless we are prodded into doing so. It relates to the first problem mentioned above. Since no one knows for certain whether or not cryostasis will work, it forces us to think about our own <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>.</p>
<p>To continue the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>, when we are young and healthy (and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance is cheap), no one really thinks much about either <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance (which is really <i><a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a></i> insurance) <i>or</i> cryostasis (which really is <i><a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a></i> insurance). That's why <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance salespeople stay in business--we need them to prod us into <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about such things. There isn't anyone around to prod us into doing something about having ourselves cryonically suspended. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this is the lack of profit motive.</p>
<p>The price charged for cryosuspension essentially covers only the cost of the procedure. There is no built-in profit, which might be available as a commission to the people who would sell it. The more people there are who elect to have themselves suspended, however, the more this issue will be in the public eye. This publicity will help to prod some people to proceed with making plans for their own suspensions. When a critical mass is reached, it will begin to feed on itself and start to grow.</p>
<p>The second problem relates to the inherent selfishness of the act. How can you go about making arrangements for your own <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a> without doing the same for everyone else in your family?</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">Cryonics</a> for Your Family Too</h1><p>When you start to look into it, you find several options available with prices varying widely from $28,000 to $150,000. By choosing the least expensive option, one can afford to pay for the suspension of five people for the same price that one would have to pay just for oneself through the most expensive plan. Many people don't believe they can afford the more expensive option if they had to pay for it for everyone in their family. Yet, price is regarded as a measure of quality, and if something costs five times as much as something else, the implication is that it must be quite a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> better.</p>
<p>To complicate <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s further, Alcor offers the "neurosuspension" option for $50,000 or so. In this scenario, only the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is preserved, and the rest of the body is disposed of in one of the more conventional ways. Even though these are formidable amounts of money for many people, when these amounts are funded with <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance policies, the monthly payments become quite affordable, even for spartan budgets.</p>
<p>One option is to purchase a term <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance policy of the appropriate amount for each family member for whom we are personally responsible. We can then elect to pay the premium on these policies until such <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as these family members are old enough and fiscally responsible for themselves. In most cases, this amounts to less than $20 a month each. Then, should they wish to join us and undergo suspension sometime in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> after (or even before) we're gone, they, too, will have that option. It's their choice.</p>
<p>There is no need to purchase these policies all at once, and, one benefit is that it will certainly made gift shopping for birthdays and holidays a lot easier. (Gee, Dad, thanks, it's just what I always wanted, a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance policy that will pay for me to get frozen after I die. Wow! What a guy!) All right, so they don't make good presents.</p>
<p>In addition, the recipients of these policies can name whomever they like as beneficiary of their <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> insurance policies. Obviously, the idea is that they name the <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> organization who will suspend them upon their death; but, if they prefer, they can simply cash the policy out or use the proceeds in a more traditional fashion (such as paying for a funeral perhaps). We do not seek to force anyone else to go the route we have chosen. We all have different drummers. We merely wish to facilitate this option for them, to make it available if they so choose.</p>
<p>Financing cryotransport in this way makes it feasible for most folks. Unfortunately, people living on very limited means, from paycheck to paycheck, will still not be able to afford this. We do not live in a perfect world. I would like to see suspension become available for everyone. The more people who choose this option, the less expensive it will become. Cryosuspension will become socially acceptable. It will become what the Extropions<sup>11</sup> call a <i><a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a>,</i> a <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that has reached the critical mass necessary to become part of our collective <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>Another important <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why it is beneficial for more people to "sign up" is because the cash infusion into the <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> coffers that would result will lead to more <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. Investment capital is urgently needed in the field of cryosuspension. As I said before, I believe there is a small, but distinct possibility, that individuals entering <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> will someday be successfully reanimated. I feel that people, who will be suspended 10 or 20 years from now, however, will have a <i>much</i> better chance, perhaps approaching 100%--simply because the freezing process will be so much improved. The degree of injury suffered by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tissues will be dramatically reduced. Therefore, even if by following a healthy lifestyle, we die before extreme <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> becomes commonplace, we can still significantly increase our chances just by surviving a few more years. By avoiding the need for <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> for several years, we will increase our chances of reanimation significantly, since the freezing process is likely to improve continuously with each passing year.</p><h1>The Bottom Line</h1><p>The bottom line is that many of us will need to look at the cryostasis option if we wish a taste of <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a> pie. Certainly, joining a cryosuspension organization for anyone who is neither old or ill might statistically seem a bad investment. The incidence of fatal disease really begins to be significant only after 60 or 65 years of age. Still, the rather abrupt onset of terminal illness, or even sudden <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, such as from a massive heart attack, does occur to individuals in their 40s and 50s, and sometimes even younger.</p>
<p>Paying the initiation fees and monthly dues to be an active member of a cryosuspension organization, as well as the cost of an insurance policy to fund the suspension itself, may seem an unnecessary extravagance to many people. Car payments and home mortgages, children's college expenses and caring for aging parents, or simply getting by on a fixed income during our retirement strains the budgets of many of us. Yet, for those with the financial where-with-all, buying a cryosuspension insurance policy might be a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able option at any age.</p>
<p>In addition to providing true "<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>" insurance, membership in a cryostasis organization provides needed capital to improve procedures and facilities for the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when we actually might need them. Another option is to "join" a cryosuspension organization as a "subscriber" rather than a member. This option avails one of regular publications and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/biostasis_entry.html">biostasis</a> for a very nominal cost.<sup>12</sup>
</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> Storage Technologies: Youth Preservation</h1><p>Cryostasis, the <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a> of one's mortal remains after <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> (or at the completion of one's "first <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle" in <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> parlance), with a view toward resuscitation in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is clearly not everyone's cup of tea. There are countless <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s why people seem to prefer the comfort of the grave or the cleansing flames of the pyre to the excruciatingly cold waters of the liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nitrogen_entry.html">nitrogen</a> dewar.</p>
<p>There is a lower rung on the cryostasis ladder, however, which requires much less of a step from the terra firma of quotidian reality. This intermediate step involves just a touch of cryostasis, and it does it in so much of a gentler, friendlier way as to make cryostasis much more acceptable to the average person. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> being that it makes a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. This baby step allows one to dip a toe into the clear cryo waters without necessitating or even suggesting that you ever have to take the full plunge. Rather than freezing one's entire body, these "<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> storage technologies" enable individuals to collect small samples of themselves and freeze them for their personal use sometime in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p><h1>The Ultimate Face Lift</h1><p>Scientists today have the ability to take a tiny piece of your skin, and grow from it sheets and sheets of new skin. You say you like your skin just the way it is now and don't feel any need for new skin? Fine. What do think the chances are that you'll feel the same way in 30 or 40 years? But what if you had taken (and frozen) a sample way back at the turn of the century, say in 2002 or 2003, when you (and your skin) were decades younger? Now all your doctor has to do is thaw out that little piece of skin that you had saved way back when your skin was young and beautiful. Using cloning technologies that are already available, new, young skin could simply be grown for you. You will be able to have the same youthful skin you had 30 or 40 years before. Talk about turning back the clock. (Makes you wish you had taken that sample back when you were a teenager, doesn't it?)</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> storage <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> isn't restricted simply to recreating new skin. Every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in your body contains within it the complete blueprint for creating every single <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in your entire body. A skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> is a skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, yet within the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> of each skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> are contained the genetic instructions for how to grow every other organ and tissue type in the body as well.</p>
<p>A skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> isn't a skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> because it has to. No one held a shotgun to its head and told it that it had to be a skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. It is this type of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> simply because certain "signaling <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s" told its <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> what parts of its <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to express.</p>
<p>Each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in the body has a complete copy of the blueprint for the entire body. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> has The Bill of Rights built right into it, which states that all genes are created equal and all cells have the right to grow up to be whatever they want. Thanks to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a>, we now have a complete copy of this blueprint--all 30,000 genes and several billion "base pairs"<sup>13</sup>
</p>
<p>By preserving a small sample of ourselves today, we effectively "freeze ourselves in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>". These <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> storage technologies are a brand new <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> industry, which offers people of today a chance to save their youthful present day <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> and transport it into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Just as we discussed <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cryostasis as a bridge by which people who die can transport themselves into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> so that they can avail themselves of the medical technologies of tomorrow, cryonic <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> storage serves as a bridge for people today to transport their present <i>youthfulness</i> into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists are currently on the steep upward slope of the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> curve of these rejuvenating technologies. Today, they still don't have the ability to create new hearts or lungs or kidneys from the <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> instructions contained in skin cells. But this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is being worked on today and only a few years away. Utilizing <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and cloning technologies, scientists are very close to being able to do this very thing--to take one type of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and instruct it how to become another type of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> or even a completely different organ. The timetable for the completion of this type of work suggests this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> should be perfected within the next one or two decades.</p>
<p>As part of the longevity evaluations performed in my anti-aging medical practice, we offer patients the opportunity to have a tiny skin sample taken from the back of the arm or leg and sent to the lab for <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a>. (For more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, see http://<a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">www</a>.cells4life.org) Then, when the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> comes some years down the line that it's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for a new heart or lungs or a pancreas or they just need some youthful skin to freshen up the appearance of their face, we expect that it will be a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> for the doctors of 2015 or 2025 simply to create the new organs or tissue from the youthful cells preserved today. For a relatively small amount of money, I feel this is the best "youth insurance policy" anyone can buy.</p>
<p>I think that cryostasis <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will soon be perfected to the point that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tissue, whether a tiny pinch of skin, a single organ or an entire body, will be able to be preserved at low temperature for prolonged periods without irreparable damage. The <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> storage and <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a>-through-vitrification technologies discussed above should make this possible within the next few years. Some aspect of the cryosuspension technologies may play an important role in anyone's longevity <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.</p>

<br>
<br>
I'm in the UK.  Can anyone tell me what my chances would be like, if I decided I wanted to be suspended?  Information seems hard to come by.  For example, does Alcor have teams in the UK, and if so, are they as efficient and reliable as they are in the US?

You can probably get info from the Life Extension Foundation as well (www.lef.org).

I would assume that Alcor handles clients from around the world, since they are the largest biz of their kind.

Of course, it would still be a useful breakthrough, and anything we can do helps our understanding, so I'm not against exploring this avenue.

I hope future technology will deliver repairs to damage done by freezing. As you know the main damage to suspendees is incurred on thawing out...which there is no reason to do @ present.

<br>
<br>
if cryonauts are ever thawed out and the synapses reconnects and read or whatever...will conciousness start up again?
<br>
<br>
In addition to that will it be a continuation of the previous conciousness?
<br>
<br>
Will it be copy and paste coniscousness? This is why we need to not only find the hardware of the brain but the software...or are they one in the same? ( i hope?- and that should be really interesting!)
<br>
<br>
I wonder if we'll ever be able to find the software for the ghost in the shell....because if we can't then we'll just have simulations, albeit good ones...but then again...we could all just be a very good simulation and not be aware of it</p></td>
