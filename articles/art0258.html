<div class="TeaserText">How <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has and will continue to assist the disabled, written for "The Futurecast," a monthly column in the Library Journal.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published May 1992. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 6, 2001.</p>
<p>Last month's Futurecast (LJ, April 15, p. 68, 70) discussed how advancing <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, aided by the ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> revolution, is rapidly ameliorating the handicaps associated with the disability of blindness. It also pointed out that in certain ways the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> barriers presented by hearing impairment have been more difficult to overcome than those for visual impairment. Again, the primary handicap has to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>--in this case, the lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to spoken <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. </p>
<p>There have been three approaches to overcoming this difficulty, each of which has made an important contribution but suffers from severe limitations. Lipreading--understanding verbal <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> by observing the movement of someone's lips--is very difficult, and few deaf persons are able to accomplish this effectively. Moreover, it is not feasible from a distance, rendering it useless at most meetings and certainly impossible on the phone. Sign <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is a rich <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that can communicate verbal thoughts with the same speed and efficacy as spoken <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. The disadvantage is obvious: very few people outside of the deaf community (which includes professionals who work with deaf persons) can "speak" or understand it. </p>
<p>Finally, there is TDD (<a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> for the deaf), which enables deaf people to "talk" on he phone by typing on a typewriter-layout keyboard and reading messages from the other party on a small screen. The limitations here also are significant. The speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> is limited to the slow speed of typing, and a deaf person can only hold such interchanges with others who have a compatible <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. The result of all of these problems is that hearing-impaired paired persons are often cut off from basic <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. </p><h1>Speak discretely </h1><p>An effective approach to this problem will be the listening <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, a sensory aid that will convert spoken <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> in real-time to a visual display of what someone is saying. As is turns out, early versions of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are not far off. What is required is the <a class="thought" href="entries/holy_grail_entry.html">Holy Grail</a> of speech recognition, combining the ability to recognize a large vocabulary (of tens of thousands of words), the ability to recognize speakers that the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has not been trained on (a capability called <a class="thought" href="entries/speaker_independence_entry.html">speaker independence</a>), and the ability to handle continuous speech (as opposed to discrete speech, which consists of spoken words separated by brief pauses). Today <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> speech-recognition systems can provide two of these three capabilities: large vocabularies and <a class="thought" href="entries/speaker_independence_entry.html">speaker independence</a> but only on discrete speech. There are continuous speech systems but most are not fully speaker independent, and there are limitations on vocabulary size. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the accuracy of a speech-recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for this application does not need to be perfect. Users will be able to compensate for occasional errors from <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. In fact, humans do this all the time. Our ability to understand human speech, as measured by standardized listening tests, decreases substantially if we listen to words in a random nonsense order as opposed to hearing words in a meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a> also makes errors, the rate of which has, of course, greatly improved in the 16 years since the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s introduction. </p>
<p>Early versions of such a listening <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could leave in the discrete speech limitation. While this would not be useful to understand what someone is saying at most meetings, it could enable a deaf person to hold a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> with a friend or loved one on the phone. The person at the other end would need to speak with brief pauses between words, but this is easily learned and is a much more rapid way of communicating than the slow typing speed of today's TDDs. Also, the deaf person would be able to communicate with anyone who has a phone. No special equipment would be required other than the deaf person having his or her own listening <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. </p>
<p>Of far greater significance, however, will be the listening <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that can handle ordinary continuous speech. Algorithms for understanding large vocabularies of continuous speech exist, but they require several hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">millions of instructions per second</a>) of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> power, which is an order of magnitude greater than today's PCs. On the other hand, with yet faster microprocessors on the way (the new "Alpha" chip recently announced by <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Equipment Corporation provides 400 <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>), the requisite computational resource will be available at reasonable cost within a couple of years. By that time, the necessary algorithmic refinement is also expected to be available. Early versions of a listening <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> for the deaf that can handle continuous speech should be expected within several years, with the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> beginning to see active deployment later in this decade. </p><h1>Seeing the words </h1><p>Persons deaf from birth or a very early age also have difficulty speaking because of the lack of the vital auditory feedback that allows hearing persons to refine their articulation. Systems are being developed that will provide an effective visual display to show a meaningful picture of speech that can be used to teach deaf children how to speak. Early versions of such systems have already been used. but the visual feedback has not provided the most useful model possible. Meaningful <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in human speech exists in the frequency <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>. and translating human speech into a model that can be appreciated by a human being visually in real-time requires <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> signal processing capabilities of substantial power. </p>
<p>It is only recently that such <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has become affordable, and a second generation of such visual feedback systems available over the next several years should be effective in substantially improving the development of these skills. Similar <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> could also be integrated into the listening machines to provide a visual display of nonspeech sounds in addition to the transcription of speech. </p>
<p>If deaf persons can readily understand human speech in real-time and improve their ability to develop speech skills, the most <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> handicaps of the hearing disability will be greatly ameliorated The social, educational, and vocational challenges that now confront most deaf persons would be largely overcome. </p><h1>The body electric </h1><p>A principal physical handicap is paraplegia--the loss of control over the legs. The most common prosthetic aid for this disability is the wheelchair, which has changed only in subtle ways over the past two decades. It continues to suffer from its principal drawback, which is the inability to negotiate doorways and stairs. Although federal law (the Americans with Disabilities Act) now requires public buildings to accommodate wheelchair <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to persons in wheelchairs is still severely restricted. </p>
<p>By the end of this decade, we will see the first generation of effective exoskeletal robotic devices, sometimes called powered orthotic devices, which will restore the ability of paraplegic (and in some cases quadriplegic) persons to walk and climb stairs. These devices will be as easy to put on as a pair of tights and will be controlled by finger <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, head <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, speech, and perhaps eventually thoughts. Another option, one that has shown promise in experiments at MIT and a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of other <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> institutions, is direct electrical stimulation of muscles. This technique effectively reconnects the control link that was broken by spinal cord damage. </p>
<p>Other disabilities will benefit as well. Already, people without use of their hands can control their environment, create written documents, and interact with computers using <a class="thought" href="entries/voice_recognition_entry.html">voice recognition</a>. Artificial hand prostheses controlled by voice, head movement, and perhaps eventually by direct mental connection will restore manual functionality. <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> is being made in intelligent courseware to treat dyslexia and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> disabilities and to provide richer <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> experiences for the retarded. </p>
<p>Overcoming the handicaps associated with disabilities is an ideal application of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. In the development of intelligent computers, the threshold that we are now on is not the creation of cybernetic geniuses. Instead, we are providing computers with narrowly focused intelligent skills, e.g., the ability to make decisions in such areas as finance and <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> and the ability to recognize patterns such as printed letters, blood cells, and land terrain maps. </p>
<p>Most computers today are still idiot savants, capable of processing enormous amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> with relatively little <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. When one considers the enormous impact that these idiot savants have had on <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, the addition of even sharply focused <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will be a formidable combination. It will be particularly beneficial for the disabled population. A disabled person is typically missing a specific cell or capability but is otherwise a normally intelligent and capable human being. There is a fortuitous matching of the narrowly focused <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of today's intelligent machines and the narrowly focused deficit of most disabled persons. Our primary strategy in developing intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for sensory and physical aids is for the focused <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to work in concert with the much more flexible <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of the disabled person. </p>
<p>There are an estimated 20 million disabled Americans. Many are unable to learn or work up to their <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> because of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that is not yet available, or <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that is available but not yet affordable, or pervasive and negative public attitudes toward disabled persons. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> changes, the perceptions will also change, particularly as formerly handicapped persons learn and work successfully alongside their nondisabled peers. By the end of the first decade of the next century, we will come to see "The End of Handicaps" as only a slight exaggeration. </p>
