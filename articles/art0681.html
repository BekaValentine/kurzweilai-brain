<p><i>Interview by Gregory T. Huang</i><br>
<br>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> doesn't make everyone happy. Just ask <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, who has pioneered everything from <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. These days the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/guru_entry.html">guru</a> is best 
              known for preaching about the perils of technology with a gloom 
              that belies his name. Joy's message is simple: limit <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              and technologies that could put unprecedented power into the hands 
              of malign <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s (what is sometimes called asymmetric <a class="thought" href="entries/warfare_entry.html">warfare</a>). 
              He is also translating that message into <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>: earlier this year, 
              his venture-capital firm announced a $200 million initiative to 
              fund projects in biodefence and preparation for pandemics. Gregory 
              T. Huang caught up with Joy at the recent Technology <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">Entertainment</a> 
              Design conference in Monterey, California.<br>
<br>
<i>Do you think your fears about technological abuse have been proven 
              right since your </i><a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">Wired</a><i> essay?</i><br>
<br>
              When I wrote that essay in 2000, I was very concerned about the 
              potential for abuse. Throughout <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, we dealt with individuals 
              through the Ten Commandments, cities through individual liberty, 
              and nation states through mutual non-aggression plus an international 
              bargain to keep the peace. Now we face an asymmetric situation where 
              technology is so powerful that it extends beyond nations to individuals 
              &#8212; some with revenge on their minds. On 11 September 2001 I was living 
              in New York City. Our company had a floor in a building that went 
              down. I had a friend on a plane that crashed. That was a huge warning 
              about asymmetric warfare and <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a>.<br>
<br>
<i>Did we learn the right lesson?</i><br>
<br>
              We can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat, 
              which is what we seem to be doing at the moment, because that is 
              to give up what makes us a civilisation. A million-dollar act causes 
              a billion dollars' damage and then a trillion-dollar response that 
              makes the problem worse. September 11 was essentially a collision 
              of early 20th-century technology: the aeroplane and the skyscraper. 
              We don't want to see a collision of 21st-century technology.<br>
<br>
<i>What would that sort of collision look like?</i><br>
<br>
              A recent article in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> said the 1918 flu is too dangerous to 
              FedEx: if you want to work on it in a lab, just reconstruct it yourself. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> we can do this is a consequence of the fact that new 
              technologies tend to be <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>. You can <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> gene sequences 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s from the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">internet</a>. So individuals and small groups 
              super-empowered by access to self-replicating technologies are clearly 
              a danger. They can cause a pandemic.<br>
<br>
<i>Why do pandemics pose such a huge danger?</i><br>
<br>
              AIDS is a sort of pandemic, but it moves slowly. We don't have much 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with the fast-moving varieties. We are not very good 
              as a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> at adapting to things we don't have gut-level experience 
              with. People don't understand the magnitude of the problem: in terms 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of deaths, there's a factor of 1000 between a pandemic 
              and a normal flu season. Public policy has not been constructive, 
              and scientists continue to publish pathogen sequences, which is 
              really quite dangerous.<br>
<br>
<i>Why is it so dangerous?</i><br>
<br>
              If in turning AIDS into a chronic <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, or making cocktails of 
              antivirals for flu, or using <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> to construct broad-spectrum 
              cures for many diseases, we make the tools universally available 
              to people of bad intent, I don't know how we will defend ourselves. 
              We have only a certain amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to come to our senses and 
              realise some information has to be handled in a different way. We 
              can reduce the risk greatly without losing much of our ability to 
              innovate. I understand why scientists are reluctant, but it's the 
              only ethically responsible thing to do.<br>
<br>
<i>So more technology is making the problem worse?</i><br>
<br>
              Unfortunately, yes. We need more policy.<br>
<br>
<i>What would that look like?</i><br>
<br>
              We could use the very <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_force_entry.html">strong force</a> of markets. Rather than regulate 
              things, we could price catastrophe into the cost of doing business. 
              Right now, if you want approval for things, you go through a regulatory 
              system. If we used insurance and actuaries to manage risk, we might 
              have a more rational process. Things judged to be dangerous would 
              be expensive, and the most expensive would be withdrawn. Drugs would 
              make it to market on economic estimates of risk not regulatory evaluations 
              of safety. This process could also be used to make companies more 
              liable for the environmental consequences of their products. It's 
              both less regulation and more accountability.<br>
<br>
<i>How are you combating the threat of pandemics?</i><br>
<br>
              We recently raised $200 million for biodefence and pandemic preparedness. 
              We have started out focusing on bird flu. We need several antivirals, 
              better surveillance, rapid diagnostics and new kinds of vaccines 
              that can be manufactured quickly. If we fill these gaps, we can 
              reduce the risk of a pandemic.<br>
<br>
<i>Do other technological advances excite you?</i><br>
<br>
              I have great confidence that we will extend the limits of Moore's 
              law to give us another factor of 100 in what computer chips can 
              do. If a computer costs $1000 today, we can have that for $10 in 
              2020. The challenge is: will we develop <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al tools to take 
              advantage of such <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s? That's a great force for peace.<br>
<br>
              Another area that gives us hope is new materials. The world's urban 
              population is expected to more than double to 6 billion this century. 
              We need clean water, <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">Carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a> 
              have incredible properties, and can be applied to develop fuel cells, 
              make clean water, or make ethanol for electric-powered transport. 
              My company has dedicated $100 million to this.<br>
<br>
<i>How do you see the increasing connectedness of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> societies 
              affecting innovation?</i><br>
<br>
              It's diffusing ideas at an incredible rate. You can use <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> tools and find out incredible things. You see companies 
              doing interesting things, and you can find out huge amounts very 
              quickly. We can write a worldwide <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> briefing paper in an 
              hour if we shut the door and unplug the telephone. That's something 
              you couldn't do before.<br>
</p>
<p><i>What's the downside?<br>
<br>
</i>It's like putting a stick in a hornet's nest. We have religious 
              and secular societies coming into contact, pre-Enlightenment values 
              conflicting with Enlightenment values. It will be a messy process 
              of change. Technology has brought western pop culture to the rest 
              of the world. I'm not a fan of it, but the values it has brought 
              to the world actually offend people in cultures that have been around 
              for longer than my particular <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of world views.<br>
<br>
<i>Will the human race survive the next 100 years?</i><br>
<br>
              We have to make it through a pandemic to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of 
              that sort of threat. Whether we do that before we unleash the technology, 
              I'm not sure. Either way, I don't believe we will become extinct 
              this century, though we could make a pretty big mess. I hope we 
              can do some sensible things. It is not enough to do great science 
              and technology, we need sensible policy. We still think that if 
              we find true things and publish them, good things happen. We should 
              not be that naive.<br>
<br>
<i>If you could ask the <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">god</a> of technology one question, what would 
              it be?</i><br>
<br>
              It seems that a perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> is a disadvantage. If you 
              are perfectly immune, you cannot evolve. A lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> occurs 
              because of selective pressure that your perfect immune system would 
              prevent. This would leave the abusers of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> with the 
              advantage over the defenders, because society needs to be vulnerable 
              so it can evolve. My question is, is that true, because it would 
              prove that we had better limit access to some information. It would 
              mean not only that we cannot make a perfect immune system, but that 
              it would be a bad idea.</p>
