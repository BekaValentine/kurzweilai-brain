<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> from the year 2040 is presented in this joint keynote address with former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres at the Annual International Conference on Personal Computing, Tel Aviv, Israel, June 25, 1995.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally presented June 25, 1995. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 8, 2001.</p>
<p>I would like to start by quoting a fellow student of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, MIT's Edward Fredkin:</p>
<blockquote>"Humans are okay. I'm glad to be one. I like them in general, but they're only human. . . .Humans aren't the best ditch diggers in the world, machines are. And humans can't lift as much as a crane. . . .It doesn't make me feel bad. There were people whose thing in life was completely physical---John Henry and the steam hammer. Now we're up against the intellectual steam hammer. . . .So the intellectuals are threatened, but they needn't be. . . .The mere idea that we have to be the best in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is kind of far fetched. We certainly aren't physically. There are three events of equal importance. . . .<a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">Event</a> one is the creation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. It's a fairly important event. <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">Event</a> two is the appearance of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is a kind of organizing principle which one might argue against if one didn't understand enough---it shouldn't or couldn't happen on thermodynamic grounds. . . .And third, there's the appearance of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>."</blockquote><h1>Part I: The Emperor of China</h1><p>As we consider the sweep of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, one <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> that stands out is <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a>. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> is the driving force behind a revolution so vast that the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> revolution to date represents only a minor ripple of its ultimate implications.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> states that computing speeds and densities double every 18 months. In other words, every 18 months we can buy a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that is twice as fast and has twice as much <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> for the same cost. Remarkably, this law has held true for more than a hundred years, from the mechanical card-based computing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the 1890 census, to the relay-based computers of the 1940s, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>-based computers of the 1950s, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>-based machines of the 1960s, to all of the generations of integrated circuits since. If you put every <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> since 1890 on a logarithmic chart, it makes an essentially straight line.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, for example, is about 16,000 times more powerful for the same unit cost as it was 20 years ago. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is about 100 million times more powerful for the same unit cost as it was in 1948, the year I was born. If the automobile industry had made as much <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the past 47 years, a car today would cost one hundredth of a cent, and would go faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Dr. <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a>, who became Intel's CEO in 1975, first observed this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> in the mid 1960s, at which time he said that the doubling occurred every 24 months. Ten years later, he revised this to 18 months.</p>
<p>There are more than enough new computing technologies being developed to assure a continuation of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> for a very long time. <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> is actually a corollary of a broader law I like to call <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s law on the exponentially quickening pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that goes back to the dawn of recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, but that's another speech.</p>
<p>The implications of this geometric trend can be understood by recalling the legend of the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of chess, and his patron, the emperor of China. The emperor had so fallen in love with his new game, that he offered the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> a reward of anything he wanted in the kingdom.</p>
<p>"Just one grain of rice on the first square, your Majesty."</p>
<p>"Just one grain of rice?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your majesty, just one grain of rice on the first square. And two grains of rice on the second square, four on the third square, and so on."</p>
<p>Well, the emperor immediately granted the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>'s seemingly humble request.</p>
<p>One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt, because the doubling of grains of rice for each square ultimately equaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, that's about half a billion square miles of rice fields, or twice the surface area of the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, oceans included.</p>
<p>Another version has the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> losing his head.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear which outcome we're headed for. But we should gain some useful perspective if we step through the chessboard from the first square.</p><h2>Square One: World War II</h2><p>"The German aircraft is the best in the world. I cannot see what we could possibly calculate to improve on."</p>
<p>With these words, the chief engineer of the German Aircraft <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Institute of the Third Reich abruptly withdrew his institute's funding of Konrad's Zuse's Zuse-3, the world's first operational programmable (<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (despite the Allies' subsequent attempt to rewrite <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and credit <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> and Harvard's Mark I with that distinction). Although he had secured his place in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, this German tinkerer's innovation remained obscure and had little influence on either the course of the war or the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.</p>
<p>By 1940 Hitler had the mainland of Europe in his grasp, and England was preparing for an anticipated invasion. The British <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> had a more prescient view of the value of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and organized its best mathematicians and electrical engineers, under the intellectual leadership of <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>, with the mission of cracking the German <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> code. It was recognized that with the German air force enjoying superiority in the skies, failure to accomplish this mission (code named ULTRA) was likely to doom the nation. In order not to be distracted from their task, the group lived in the tranquil community of Dollis Hill, a suburb north of London, with a parallel effort at Bletchley Park, 40 miles northwest of London.</p>
<p>The British <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a> had obtained a working model of the German "Enigma" coding <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in 1938 from a still unheralded hero of World War II, a young Jewish Polish engineer named Richard Lewinsky, who had worked briefly in eastern Germany helping to assemble the <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>. Coded orders sent by radio from the German high command were easily intercepted, but to decode these messages every combination of the positions of the Enigma <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>'s coding wheels needed to be evaluated. Turing and his colleagues constructed a series of machines in 1940 from telephone relays which they called <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>, after a popular cartoonist who drew "Rube Goldberg" machines. The group's own Rube Goldberg <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> succeeded brilliantly and provided the British with a transcription of nearly all significant Nazi messages. As the Germans continued to add to the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of their code (by adding additional coding wheels to their Enigma coding <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>), Turing and his associates replaced <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/electromagnetic_entry.html">electromagnetic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (which took about three tenths of a second to add two numbers) with an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> version called <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> built in 1943 from 2,000 radio tubes. <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a>, which was 1,500 times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> (which represented several of the early squares on the chess board and was itself a dramatic example of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's Law</a>), and nine similar machines running in parallel provided an uninterrupted decoding of vital <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to the Allied war effort.</p>
<p>Use of this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> required supreme acts of discipline on the part of the British <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>. When informed by ULTRA that Coventry was to be bombed, Churchill ordered that the city not be warned, and that no civil defense steps be taken, lest preparations arouse German suspicions that their code has been cracked. The <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> provided by <a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> (the world's first operational special purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>) and <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">Colossus</a> was used only with the greatest discretion (for example to guide critical British ships through the German U-boats), but the cracking of Enigma was enough to enable the Royal Air Force to win the Battle of Britain.</p>
<p>Thus fueled by the exigencies of war, and drawing upon a <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of intellectual traditions, a new form of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> emerged on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>.</p><h2>Turing's Ruminations</h2><p>The similarity of the computational process to the human <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process was not lost on Turing, and he is credited with having established much of the theoretical foundations of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> and the ability to apply this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to the emulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In his classic 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>," published in the journal <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a>, Turing predicted that by early in the next century, <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> will simply take for granted the pervasive intervention of intelligent machines in all phases of life, that "the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> without expecting to be contradicted."</p>
<p>Turing went on to lay out an agenda that would in fact occupy the next half century of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> by describing a series of goals in game playing, decision making, <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding, translation, theorem proving, and, of course, <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> and the cracking of codes. He wrote (with his friend David Champernowne) the first chess-playing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.</p>
<p>He also defined the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a>, a theoretical model of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, which continues to form the basis of modern computational theory. The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_machine_entry.html">Turing Machine</a> led to the discovery of "intelligent" mathematical functions such as the "<a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">Busy Beaver</a>" function, a remarkable function that actually requires higher levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to solve for higher operands, a kind of mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> test. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, for example, tops out at about <a class="thought" href="entries/busy_beaver_entry.html">busy beaver</a> of 30.</p>
<p>Perhaps best known of Turing's intellectual contributions is the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, presented as a means for determining whether or not a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is intelligent. The test involves a human judge being unable to tell the difference between a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and a human "foil" by communicating with each through written (e-mail-like) messages. The <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> takes place over terminal lines to prevent the judge from being prejudiced against the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for lacking a warm and fuzzy appearance. It should be noted that while an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> "passing" the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> signifies the possession of human-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>; the converse does not necessarily hold. Some observers ascribe a high level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to certain <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of animals such as dolphins and whales, but neither are in a position to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> (they have no fingers, for one thing). Turing predicted that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would pass his test by early in the next century.</p>
<p>As a person, Turing was unconventional and extremely sensitive. He had a wide range of unusual interests ranging from the violin to morphogenesis (the differentiation of cells). There were public reports of his homosexuality, which greatly disturbed him, and he died at the age of 41, a suspected suicide.</p><h1>Part II: The Hard Things were Easy</h1><p>In the 1950s (the sixth through eleventh squares of the chessboard), <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> came so rapidly that some of the early pioneers felt that mastering the functionality of the human brain might not be so difficult after all. In 1956, Carnegie Mellon's Allen Newell, J.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Shaw and Herbert Simon created a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> Theorist (and a later version called General Problem Solver in 1957) which used recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> techniques to solve problems in <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. It was able to find proofs for many of the key theorems in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica (a three volume treatise published in 1910-1913 that revolutionized <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> by recasting it in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/set_theory_entry.html">set theory</a>), including a completely original proof for an important <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> theorem that Whitehead and Russell had been unable to solve. In one trial run, <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">Logic</a> Theorist found proofs for 38 of the Principia Theorems, solving half of these in under a minute each, and accomplishing the rest in times ranging from one to forty-five minutes each, running on a JOHNNIAC, a 1955 <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a 50 microsecond addition time. These early successes led Simon and Newell to say in a 1958 paper entitled "<a class="thought" href="entries/heuristic_entry.html">Heuristic</a> Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>," "There are now in the world machines that think, that learn and that create. Moreover, their ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until---in a visible <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>---the range of problems they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied." The paper goes on to predict that within ten years (that is, by 1968) a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would be the world chess champion. A decade later, an unrepentant Simon predicted that by 1985, "machines will be capable of doing any work that a man can do." Perhaps Simon was intending a favorable comment on the capabilities of women, but predictions of this sort, decidedly more optimistic than Turing's, resulted in extensive criticism for the nascent <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> field.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, the academic field of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> began to flesh out the agenda that Turing had described in 1950, with encouraging or frustrating results depending on your point of view. MIT's Thomas G. Evans' 1963 <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">Analogy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> could solve <a class="thought" href="entries/iq_entry.html">IQ</a> test geometric-<a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> problems, and Daniel G. Bobrow's 1964 <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> Student could solve <a class="thought" href="entries/algebra_entry.html">algebra</a> problems from natural English <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> stories. These two programs reportedly could outperform most high school students. The field of expert systems was initiated with Stanford University Professor Edward A. Feigenbaum's <a class="thought" href="entries/dendral_entry.html">DENDRAL</a>, begun in 1965, which could answer questions about chemical compounds. Work at Stanford, later moved to CMU by <a class="thought" href="entries/reddy_entry.html">Raj Reddy</a>, produced impressive early results in speech recognition, including a 600 word vocabulary speech recognizer running on a PDP-11. Richard D. Greenblatt's 1966 chess <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> broke into the national chess ranks with respectable tournament ratings, and received a lot of publicity when it defeated the noted <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> critic Hubert Dreyfus (see below). And <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding got a boost with Terry Winograd's landmark 1970 Ph.D. thesis <a class="thought" href="entries/shrdlu_entry.html">SHRDLU</a>, which could understand any meaningful English sentence, so long as you talked about colored blocks.</p>
<p>The notion of creating a new form of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> on earth emerged with an intense and often uncritical passion simultaneously with the electro-mechanical and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> computers on which it was to be based. The unbridled enthusiasm of the field's early pioneers also led to extensive criticism for the inability of these early programs to react intelligently in a variety of situations. Some critics, most notably existentialist philosopher, phenomenologist and Berkeley Professor Hubert Dreyfus predicted in a 1965 RAND Corporation memorandum entitled "Alchemy and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>" (which he subsequently expanded into a 1972 book entitled What Computers Can't Do) that machines would never match human levels of skill in areas ranging from the playing of chess to the preparing of university lectures.</p>
<p>It turned out that the problems we <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> were difficult---solving mathematical theorems, playing respectable games of chess, reasoning within domains such as <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>---were easy and the multi-thousand through multi-hundred-thousand instructions-per-second computers of the 1950s and 1960s (the sixth through eighteenth squares of the chessboard) were often adequate to provide satisfactory results. What proved elusive were the skills that any five year-old child possessed: telling the difference between a dog and a cat, or tying one's shoelaces. Indeed, our robots are still unable to tie shoelaces, which is perhaps one <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that they still don't wear shoes.</p><h2>Invisible <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">Species</a></h2><p>In the early 1980s, we arrived at the twenty-fifth square and saw the early commercialization of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> with a wave of new <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> companies forming and going public. A <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of these companies concentrated on a powerful but inherently slow (at least in those days) interpretive <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that had been popular in academic <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> circles called <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">LISP</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> failure of <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">LISP</a> and the "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>" companies that emphasized it (e.g., Symbolics, Lisp Machines, Inc.) created a backlash in the financial community. The field of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> started shedding its constituent disciplines, and companies in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding, <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> translation, character recognition, speech recognition, <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> vision and other areas originally considered part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> discipline now shunned association with the field's label. Although one <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, did attempt to counter that trend when he named his new speech recognition company <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> in 1982.</p>
<p>Machines with sharply focused <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> nonetheless became increasingly pervasive. By the early 1990s, we saw the infiltration of our financial institutions by systems using such computerized techniques as neural networks, markov modeling, time-delay embedding and <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> modeling. Not only were the stock, bond, currency, commodity, and other markets managed and maintained by computerized networks, but the majority of buy-and-sell decisions were initiated by <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> programs that used these techniques on increasingly extensive on-line databases (e.g. Midland Global Markets' 16 Gigabyte <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> in 1993 recorded every moment of trading in the Standard and Poor 500 and several other markets for the prior 10 years). The 1987 stock market crash was blamed on the rapid interaction of trading programs. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> generated sales pushed prices down which triggered more automated selling which caused a selling spiral. This synthetic selling panic developed in a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of minutes and resulted in a half trillion dollars of lost value. Suitable modifications to these algorithms, including automated shut-downs of trading in specific stocks and/or entire markets, have managed to avoid a repeat performance.</p>
<p>Since 1990, your electrocardiogram (ECG) has come complete with the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s own diagnosis of your cardiac health. Intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/image_processing_entry.html">image processing</a> programs enabled doctors to peer deep into our bodies and brains, and computerized <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> enabled drugs to be designed on biochemical simulators.</p>
<p>The handicapped have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of the <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">age of intelligent machines</a>. Reading machines have been reading to the blind and dyslexic persons since 1976, and speech recognition and robotic devices have been assisting the hands impaired since 1985.</p>
<p>By 1993, the value of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> as the primary cornerstone of <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and power had become clear in a variety of domains. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> companies were growing rapidly and enjoyed impressive price-to-earnings ratios (e.g., Lotus: 60-1, Oracle: 42-1, Powersoft: 52-1, Sybase: 41-1, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> Arts: 44-1, not to mention <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>: 25-1), while the traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> companies were in decline. Intel might be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to have been an exception to this, but chip design (particularly of proprietary value-added chips such as microprocessors) is properly regarded as a form of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p>It was in the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> that the public saw perhaps the most dramatic display of the changing values of the age of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. We saw the first effective example of the increasingly dominant role of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the Gulf War of 1991. The cornerstones of <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> power from the beginning of recorded <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> through most of the 20th century---geography, manpower, firepower, and battle-station defenses---were largely replaced by the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> and electronics. Intelligent scanning by unstaffed airborne vehicles; weapons finding their way to their destinations through <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> vision and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>; intelligent communications and coding protocols; and other manifestations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> age began to rapidly transform the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of war.</p>
<p>With the increasingly important role of intelligent machines in all phases of our lives---<a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>, medical, economic and financial, political---it was thus odd to keep reading articles with titles such as Whatever Happened to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>? This was a <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> that Turing had predicted, that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> would become so pervasive, so comfortable, and so well integrated into our <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based economy that people would fail to even notice it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of people who walk in the rain forest and ask, "Where are all these <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that are supposed to live here?" when there are a hundred <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of ant alone within 50 feet of them. Our many <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> have woven themselves so seamlessly into our modern rain forest that they are all but invisible.</p>
<p>Turing offers an explanation of why we would fail to acknowledge <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in our machines. In 1947, he writes: "The extent to which we regard something as behaving in an intelligent manner is determined as much by our own state of mind and training as by the properties of the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> under consideration. If we are able to explain and predict its behavior we have little temptation to imagine <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. With the same <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, therefore, it is possible that one man would consider it as intelligent and another would not; the second man would have found out the rules of its behavior."</p>
<p>I am also reminded of Elaine Rich's definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> as the "study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better."</p><h1>Part III: The Middle of the Chessboard</h1><p>Returning to our story of the emperor and the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>, there is one aspect that we should take particular note of. It was fairly uneventful as the emperor and the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> went through the first half of the chessboard (remember the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> had asked for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second square, four on the third square, and so on). After 32 squares, the emperor had given the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> about 4 billion grains of rice. That's a reasonable quantity of rice---it's about one tenth of a square mile's worth---and the emperor did start to take notice.</p>
<p>But the emperor could still remain an emperor, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> could still retain his head. It was as they headed into the second half of the chessboard, that at least one of them got into trouble.</p>
<p>So where did we stand in 1995? Well, there had been about 32 doublings of performance since Zuse's and Turing's relay-based computers of the early 1940s. So where we stood in 1995 is that we had just finished the first half of the chess board. And indeed people were starting to take notice.</p>
<p>But as we headed into the rest of the 1990s and the next century, we were heading into the second half of the chessboard. And that is where things started to get interesting.</p>
<p>We realized in 1995 that we had failed to explore the third dimension in chip design. Chips circa 1995 were flat, whereas our brain is organized in three dimensions. We live in a three dimensional world, so why not use the third dimension?</p>
<p>Improvements in the late 1990s in <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> materials, including the development of superconducting circuits that do not generate heat, enabled the development of chips, or I should say cubes, with many of layers of circuitry, which when combined with smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> geometries, assured the continuation of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> over the next three decades (by the end of which we would obtain ten doublings of performance by creating integrated cubes with one thousand layers of circuitry and another eight doublings by reducing line widths to 40 nanometers).</p><h2>The Virtual Book</h2><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of books and other written documents underwent several transformations during this period. In 1995 and 1996, written text began to be created on voice-activated word processors. I brought with me a demonstration of a circa 1995 voice activated computing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> VOICE for <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a>. This is a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> than ran on an ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> running <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>.</p>
<p>By 1997, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> resulted in the advent of paperless books with the introduction of portable and <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> displays that had the resolution (300 to 600 spots-per-inch), contrast qualities (at least 100:1), lack of flicker, viewing angle, and quality of color (24 bits-per-pixel) of high quality paper documents. Unlike the <a class="thought" href="entries/graphical_user_interface_entry.html">Graphical User Interface</a> (GUI) invented at <a class="thought" href="entries/xerox_parc_entry.html">Xerox PARC</a> in 1973, but then fumbled commercially by Xerox, PARC's breakthrough in display <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> did produce substantial licensing revenues that boosted Xerox's bottom line during the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Books, magazines and newsletters no longer required a physical form, and <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s FUTURESCOPE became one of the first commercially successful virtual newsletters. A FUTURESCOPE editorial pointed out, however, that despite paperless publishing and the so-called paperless office, the use of paper continued to increase nonetheless. American use of paper for books, magazines, and other documents grew from 850 billion pages in 1981 to 2.5 trillion pages in 1986 to six trillion pages in 1996. But this figure would prove to be a peak, and by the end of the decade, paper documents would be back down to under 3 trillion pages.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of a document also underwent substantial change and now routinely included voice, music, and other sound annotations. The graphic part of documents became more flexible: fixed illustrations turned into animated pictures. Documents included the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to respond intelligently to the inputs and reactions of readers (e.g. a joint venture of the Gartner Group and <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>'s "PAM" (Please Ask Me) <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>, introduced in 1998, that responded to spoken <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> questions pertaining to the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of written documents). The "pages" of a document were no longer necessarily ordered sequentially; the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> and other hyperdocuments became capable of forming intuitive patterns that reflected the complex web of relationships among ideas.</p>
<p>Despite these innovations in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of a document, the art of creating written text remained a key objective of the educational process. It became widely recognized that written <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> was a powerful form of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> compression and a prerequisite to the effective <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> of ideas. With advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, the first truly useful <a class="thought" href="entries/grammar_entry.html">grammar</a> and style checkers (in which the majority of comments generated were actually pertinent) became available in 1997.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> superhighway, first widely discussed in the early 1990s, was originally expected to take twenty years to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the massive new fiber-optic infrastructure required. By 1994, we realized that we only needed to bring the new fiber-optic infrastructure to within a mile of its final destination. <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> to the home and office for this critical "last mile" was able to use the existing <a class="thought" href="entries/coaxial_entry.html">coaxial</a> cable <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> which is also capable of providing ten billion-bit-per-second point-to-point <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, at least for short distances (but for the last mile, that's all we needed). New <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> and satellite communications using frequencies at the microwave range and higher also became available that were capable of providing ten billion-bit-per-second <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, again only for distances of approximately a mile.</p>
<p>It turned out that this last mile of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> represented about 90 percent of the infrastructure that we originally had contemplated. So the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> superhighway was largely in place by the turn of the century, arriving at least a decade earlier than anticipated at the beginning of the 1990s.</p>
<p>American fears that the Japanese would <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> their <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> superhighway substantially ahead of the U.S. also turned out to be unfounded. The U.S. based albeit international <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> called <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, created by the U.S. Department of Defense and originally called ARPANET for DOD's Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects Agency (but that subsequently took on a life of its own) was a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for which the Japanese had no direct counterpart. While the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> itself, based on the old copper-wire-based telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, was supplanted by the largely optical and satellite-based superhighway, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> had provided the U.S. with a depth of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> and motivation that no other nation was able to match.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> provided the countries of the Middle East with an effective marketing channel to the rest of the world. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> companies harnessing talent throughout the Middle East challenged the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> industries in Massachusetts, Palo Alto and Redmont for leadership in several <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> technologies, including handprint recognition, image analysis and neural net based decision making for financial markets.</p>
<p>In 1997, we saw the emergence of effective speaker dependent large vocabulary continuous speech recognition for text creation running on 300 MIPs personal computers. The development of speaker independent large vocabulary continuous speech recognition in 1998 permitted the introduction of listening machines for the deaf, which converted human speech (initially only in English, Japanese and German) into a visual display of text---essentially the opposite of reading machines for the blind. Another handicapped population that was able to benefit from these early <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> technologies was paraplegic individuals, who were now able to walk using exoskeletal robotic devices they controlled using a specialized cane.</p>
<p>In 1999, we saw the first effective real-time translating telephones demonstrated, although the service was not routinely offered. Both the recognitions and translations were far from perfect, but they appeared to be usable.</p>
<p>1999 also saw the first effective competition to the 27 varieties of <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> then offered by <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>. The "blank sheet" <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> offered by a joint venture of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> and Novell (which had acquired <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> in 1996) was the first to offer an effective integration of <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> understanding, speech recognition and gesture processing.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> circa 2000 was a virtual book: a thin light weight slab that came in a variety of sizes from pocket-sized to large wall-sized displays. Resolution, contrast, flicker and color qualities all matched high quality paper-based documents, which accounted for the reversal in paper usage trends. By the turn of the century, the majority of reading was done on virtual documents. The primary input modality was a combination of speaker-independent large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition for text entry with pen-based computing for pointing and two-dimensional gestures. Requests for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and other commands could be expressed by voice in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> (for example, "find me all KeyNote addresses to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> conferences in the Middle East that express the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> revolution in terms of a chessboard metaphor using <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a>"). There was only one physical connector to permit connection to a high <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> superhighway port, but most <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> was <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>, and users were on-line all the time. McLuhan's global village had arrived.</p><h1>Part IV: A Proven Design</h1><h2>The Invisible Book</h2><p>As we entered the first decade of the 21st century and the thirty-eighth square of the chessboard, with PCs now sporting 2,000 MIPs, the translating telephones demonstrated late in the last century began to be offered by the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> companies (which were an amalgam of former telephone and cable companies and even a few former newspaper publishers) competing for international customers. The quality varied considerably from one pair of languages to another. Even though English and Japanese are very different in <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, this pair of languages appeared to offer the best performance, although translation among different European languages was close. Outside of English, Japanese, and a few European languages, performance fell off dramatically.</p>
<p>The output displays for the listening machines for the deaf were now built into the user's eyeglasses, essentially providing subtitles on the world. Specific funding was included in the U.S. Omnibus Disabled Act of 2004 to provide these sensory aids for deaf persons who could not afford them, with similar legislation in other European, Asian and Middle Eastern countries, although complex regulations on verifying income levels were so intrusive that most deaf persons ignored the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and acquired the devices on their own.</p>
<p>The billionaire who emerged in 2005 was an <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> whose line of EEG-driven computers were capable of inducing desirable mental states on demand and became the treatment of choice for hypertension and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>As we entered the forty-forth square of the chessboard, the standard 100,000 MIPs <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> circa 2010 was now largely invisible. Most users used the eyeglass displays originally developed for the deaf sensory aids to provide three-dimensional displays that overlaid the ordinary visual world. Speech recognition continued to be a primary input modality for text, and pen-based computing was now replaced with finger <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> gestures within the virtual display. A variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> navigators were available with customizable personalities, the most popular being "Michelle," a feminine persona with a distinctly Creole flavor.</p><h2>The Arrival of TIM</h2><p>Everyone recalls the flap when TIM was introduced. TIM, which stands for Turing's IMage, was created at the University of Texas in 2011 and was presented as the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>. The researchers claimed that they had even exceeded Turing's original challenge because you could converse with TIM by voice rather than through terminal lines as Turing had originally envisioned. In an issue of FUTURESCOPE devoted to the TIM controversy, Hubert Dreyfus, the persistent critic of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> field, dismissed the original announcement of TIM as the usual hype we have come to expect from the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community.</p>
<p>Eventually, even <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> leaders rejected the claim citing the selection of a human "judge" unfamiliar with the state of the art in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> and the fact that not enough time had been allowed for the judge to interview the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and the human foil. TIM became, however, a big hit at Tel Aviv's new Disney World, where 200 TIMs were installed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Pavilion.</p>
<p>The TIM <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was quickly integrated into <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> systems which were now revolutionizing the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, having long been established in the game industry. So rather than read about the U.S. Constitutional Convention, a student could now debate a simulated Ben Franklin on executive war powers, the role of the courts, or any other issue. It is difficult now to recall that the medium they used to call television was itself controversial in its day, despite the fact that it was of low resolution, two dimensional and non interactive. <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> was still a bit different from the real thing, though, in that the ability of the artificial people in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> to understand what you were saying still seemed a bit stilted.</p><h2>A Proven Design that's not even Copyrighted</h2><p>During the second decade of this century, with the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human Genome project</a> largely completed, the HUNES (HUman <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">NEuron</a> Scan) project was initiated to similarly scan and record the neural organization of the human brain. In accordance with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a>, we expected to reach the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the human brain---20 million billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> connection calculations per second (100 billion neurons times an average of 1,000 connections to other neurons times 200 calculations per second per connection) in a standard <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>---by the year 2020. We should note that the acceleration of speed of the massively parallel neural computers progressed faster than the speed of sequential computers because the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of neural connection calculations per second benefits from the doubling of density as well as the doubling of speed of semiconductors every 18 months. And as we drew close to reaching the raw computational ability to simulate the human brain, the HUNES effort to reverse engineer this proven design picked up intensity.</p><h2>Square 50</h2><p>In the year 2020, at that time eighty percent of the way through the chessboard, translating telephones were used routinely, and, while the languages available were still limited, there was more choice with reasonable performance for Chinese and Korean.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> navigators available on the personal computers of 2020, unlike those of ten years earlier, could interview humans in their <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> instead of just other computers. People used them as personal <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> assistants.</p>

<a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">Virtual reality</a> was much more lifelike and began to include the ability to provide physical sensations. An article in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Magazine's virtual edition of January 1, 2020 examined the growing availability of erotic <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> systems and pointed out that every new <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> had been extensively exploited for this purpose. Guttenberg's first book may have been the Bible, but more prurient themes were a major source of publishing revenues for the century that followed.</p>
<p>There was a <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> of people who spent virtually all their time in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> and did not want to come out. What to do about that became a topic of considerable debate.</p>
<p>WalMart emerged as the dominant force in the Virtual Mall wars, although it closed its last physical store two years earlier.</p>
<p>We realized in 2020 how prescient Turing was 70 years earlier. The brain's computational ability--20 million billion neural connection calculations per second--was available in a standard personal <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural computer</a>. While not everyone in 2020 agreed that computers could pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, few doubted that with the completion of the HUNES project, expected by 2030, that computers would achieve human levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by that time. In retrospect, Turing's 1950 prediction that his <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> would be passed by a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (indicating human level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>) by early in the Twenty-First century was so close to accurate that he must have had an implicit understanding of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> (he had indeed seen the 1,500-fold speed improvement of his own computers through the duration of World War II), although he never articulated the rule as clearly as did Dr. Moore.</p>
<p>In 2021 the University of Texas announced a new version of TIM, which received a more enthusiastic reception from <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> experts. <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, then 93, one of the fathers of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, who was contacted at his retirement home in Florida, hailed the development as the realization of Turing's original vision. Dreyfus, then 91, however, remained unconvinced and challenged the Texas researchers to use him as the human judge in their experiments.</p><h2>So Here We Are</h2><p>So here we are in the year 2030. A new generation of high-speed, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, that is <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>, scanners, had been developed in 2025 that is capable of resolving <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> nerve fibers only several microns in diameter without disturbing the living tissue being scanned. These new <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a> scanners are also able to view the presynaptic vessicles that are the site of human <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. These high resolution scanners enabled us to complete the HUNES (<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">NEuron</a> Scan) project in 1929, a year ahead of schedule. People are now scanning their brains and are using their <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>'s as personal back-up systems.</p>
<p>Now the ability to <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> your mind to your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> is raising some interesting issues. I'll mention just a few.</p>
<p>There's the philosophical issue. When people are scanned and then re-created in a <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_computer_entry.html">neural computer</a>, people are wondering just who are these people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>?</p>
<p>The answer depends on who you ask. If you ask the people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, they strenuously claim to be the original persons, having lived certain lives, having gone into a scanner here, and then have woken up in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> there. They say, "hey, this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> really works. You should give it a try."</p>
<p>On the other hand, the original people who are scanned claim that the people in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> are imposters, people who just appear to share their memories, histories and personalities, but who are definitely different people.</p>
<p>There's the psychological issue. A <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that has been derived from human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> needs a body. A disembodied mind quickly becomes depressed.</p>
<p>Ironically, it will take us longer to recreate our bodies than it took us to recreate our minds. We are making exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in providing the computational resources to simulate <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> passing of time. But we are only making <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> with the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> passing of time in robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. So it will take us longer to recreate the suppleness of our bodies than the intricacies and subtleties of our minds.</p>
<p>There's the ethical issue. Is it immoral, or perhaps illegal, to cause pain and suffering to your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>? Is it illegal to turn your <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> off? Perhaps it is illegal to turn it off only if you have failed to make a recent backup copy. Some commentators have expressed concern that they may soon wish to turn us off.</p>
<p>And of course, there is the usual line-up of economic and political issues. The Luddite issue, which is the concern over the negative impact of machines on human employment, has become of intense interest once again.</p>
<p>Before Copernicus, our "speciecentricity," (I made up that word, by the way, in case you never heard it before) was embodied in a view of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> literally circling around us as a testament to our unique and central status. Today, our belief in our own uniqueness is not a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of celestial relationships, but rather of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> is seen as a billion year drama leading inexorably to its grandest creation: human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. The specter of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> competing with that of its creator is once again threatening our view of who we are.</p><h2>The End of the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">Chess</a> Board</h2><p>Well we have now peered about 90% of the way through the chessboard. We might wonder happens at the end of the chessboard?</p>
<p>In the year 2040, we will reach the 64th square. In my view, <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a> will still be going strong. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> circuits will be grown like crystals with computing taking place at the molecular level.</p>
<p>By the year 2040, in accordance with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s%20Law')">Moore's law</a>, your state-of-the-art <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> will be able to simulate a <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> of 10,000 human brains, each of which would be operating at a speed 10,000 times faster than a human brain.</p>
<p>Or, alternatively, it could <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> a single mind with 10,000 times the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of a human brain and 100 million times the speed. What will the implications be of this development?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, I've run out of time, so you'll have to invite me back.</p>
<p>But I'll leave with you two thoughts, written by people who did not have the benefit of a voice activated <a class="thought" href="entries/word_processor_entry.html">word processor</a>.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu, Chou dynasty philosopher and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> strategist, wrote in the fourth century BC:</p>
<p>"<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> is power</p>
<p>and permits the wise to conquer</p>
<p>without bloodshed</p>
<p>and to accomplish deeds</p>
<p>surpassing all others."</p>
<p>And Shakespeare wrote</p>
<p>"We know what we are,</p>
<p>but know not</p>
<p>what we might become."</p>
<p>And in the New York Times this morning, there is another front-page article entitled, "Whatever Happened to <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>?"</p>

Curious to know your view on patents, especially as the human mind may become downloadable into one's PC.  How may one exclude others from infringing one's ideas if ideas can be published to the web instantaneously?  And when this capacity occurs will society need temporary economic incentives created by patent law?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi farrington,
<br>
<br>
Bletchely Park and Los Alamos were government drives with high energy almost no budgets and intensity focused by the military agenda and secracy.
<br>
<br>
they were dominated by the two characters Turing and Feynman (feynman's lectures are about for download)
<br>
<br>
What was significant was that science had come of age i the public media once more since da Vinci and Archimedes won wars with their stuff.
<br>
<br>
<br>
i dont think Turing wrong. he thihght that the mind/brain could be simulated.
<br>
<br>
The Church-Turing hypothesis that anything that the brain can think can be programmed as an algorithm seems correect for me.
<br>
<br>
I've chatted to former poeple at Station X and they were incedibly mechised, routine that people would wince at doing now.
<br>
<br>
What strikes me is the the individual endevour to reach excellence backed up by universities can produce incredible things</p></td>
