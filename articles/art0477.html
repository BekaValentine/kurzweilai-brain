<div class="TeaserText">External Counterpulsation (ECP) is an ingenious method for treating angina that doesn't use drugs, is non-invasive, inexpensive and safe -- unlike conventional surgical procedures such as angioplasty and bypass surgery. Physicians should 
 inform patients of all the treatment options available for ischemic heart disease, including FDA-approved ECP, says physician Dr. Grossman.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net June 17, 2002.</i></p>
<p>
<p>Cardiovascular <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> is the leading cause of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in the U.S., 
              according to CDC statistics.<sup>1</sup> Conventional treatment 
              options typically include lifestyle modification, prescription drugs 
              and surgery. While often effective at relieving symptoms such as 
              chest pain or angina, these therapies have several drawbacks. They 
              are frequently ineffective at extending <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, are associated with 
              numerous side effects and complications, and are expensive. Heart 
              surgery carries a significant risk of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, and often leads to 
              other morbid events. 
            <p>In addition, a significant <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of successfully treated patients 
              become "treatment failures" over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Following bypass 
              surgery, it is estimated that only 75% of patients remain free of 
              cardiac ischemia for five years, a figure that drops to 50% by ten 
              years.<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>Most new medical advances for treating heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> are, for the 
              most part, extensions of two existing therapies: prescription drugs 
              and invasive surgical procedures. Any new therapy that could impact 
              the leading cause of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in this country would represent a major 
              advancement in anti-aging therapeutics. There is currently such 
              a therapy, which is an entirely new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> for treating heart 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>.<sup>3</sup> This procedure is called either External Counterpulsation 
              (ECP)<sup>4</sup> or Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP)<sup>5</sup> 
              and has recently received FDA approval for treatment for ischemic 
              heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>.<sup>6</sup> </p>
<p> In development for almost 50 years, ECP is an ingenious <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> 
              for treating angina that does not use drugs and is completely non-invasive.<sup>7</sup> 
              For the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> since the advent of bypass surgery, a unique 
              therapeutic dimension has emerged for the treatment of patients 
              with ischemic heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>.<sup>8</sup> </p>
<p></p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> of Counterpulsation</h2>
<p>[Counterpulsation<sup>9</sup>]<br>
              Kantrowitz and Kantrowitz were the first to describe the principle 
              of "phase shift" diastolic <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a> in the 1950's. 
              Ten years later, Jacobey et al. provided the first evidence that 
              counterpulsation could enhance the development of coronary collateral 
              circulation. They suggested that counterpulsation might have value 
              in the treatment of patients with coronary insufficiency and angina. 
              At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, Birtwell and Clause working at Harvard developed 
              the Intra-aortic Balloon Pump to help support blood circulation 
              during cardiac surgery and in cases of cardiogenic shock.<sup>10</sup>
<p>In 1983, Zheng and associates at Sun Yat Sen University in China 
              designed a sequenced pneumatic external counterpulsation <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, 
              which produced excellent results in cases of coronary insufficiency.<sup>11</sup> 
              Long-term relief from symptoms of chronic angina were noted. These 
              favorable results led a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of scientists in the U.S. to begin 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> into external counterpulsation. In 1995 an American company 
              began <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ing the Chinese <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> following FDA market approval.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">Action</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
<p>Though a non-invasive <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> itself, we see that external counterpulsation 
              had its origins in a very invasive <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, the intra-aortic balloon 
              pump. ECP has a similar mechanism to the intra-aortic balloon pump, 
              but works on the outside of the body. A modern day ECP unit consists 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a>, which triggers the sequential <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> 
              with compressed air of cuffs that are wrapped around a patient's 
              calves, thighs and buttocks. Compression is triggered to occur during 
              diastole (the resting phase of the heart rhythm). As the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              inflates the cuffs, blood is propelled from the lower body back 
              into the heart. At the end of diastole, the ECP <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> signals 
              the sudden and simultaneous deflation of the cuffs, greatly reducing 
              vascular resistance and assisting the heart with its next beat. 
              This <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> also facilitates venous return of blood into the heart, 
              increasing cardiac output. </p>
<p>ECP improves blood flow to the coronary arteries and helps treat 
              angina, the indication for which it has received FDA approval. Most 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers feel that ECP helps angina by causing the release of 
              a hormone known as vascular endothelial <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> factor (VEGF). As 
              ECP causes the heart to receive an unexpected surge of blood during 
              diastole (when it is normally emptying), VEGF levels increase dramatically. 
              VEGF promotes the development of collateral coronary vessels.<sup>12</sup> 
              In other words, ECP <i>causes the heart to grow its own bypasses</i>. 
              For the past few years, doctors at The Texas Heart Institute have 
              been involved in gene-therapy <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, trying to develop an injectible 
              form of VEGF as well.<sup>13</sup> </p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Need for ECP </h2>
<p>
<p>
<p>ECP fills a critical need because an increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of patients 
              with refractory angina are either unwilling or unable to undergo 
              invasive revascularization surgery. Many patients who have undergone 
              bypass surgery are reluctant to undergo repeat surgery after their 
              first (or even second) bypass has begun to fail. Additionally, thanks 
              to better lifestyle choices, aggressive cardiac rehabilitation <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, 
              and conventional medical and surgical therapies, many patients with 
              cardiovascular <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> are now living much longer lives. Many now 
              live long enough that they reach a point where invasive therapies 
              become too dangerous and/or medications are no longer effective. 
            </p>
<p>Yet, the dilemma is that improving the quality of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> with medication 
              and surgery in elderly patients is more difficult due to the higher 
              incidence of adverse side effects. For example, Taddei found that 
              for every ten-year increase in age, the risk of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> for patients 
              undergoing balloon angioplasty increases 65%.<sup>14</sup> Alexander 
              found that octogenarians undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting 
              had a 270% increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> compared to younger patients and 
              twice the incidence of postoperative stroke and renal failure.<sup>15</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to age, other <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that often preclude angina patients 
              from pursuing further treatment with drugs or surgery include: unavailability 
              of grafts, comorbid situations such as diabetes or congestive heart 
              failure, adverse coronary anatomy, and intolerance or ineffectiveness 
              of medications. ECP is an excellent option for such patients and 
              has been shown in numerous studies to be effective in cases where 
              coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery has failed.<sup>16,17</sup>
</p>
<p>Today's patients are better educated about their <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. They 
              are more aware of treatment options and consequently seek safer 
              and less invasive treatments. They understand that surgical procedures 
              such as stent placement, angioplasty and bypass surgery are not 
              free of risk. Even the newest surgical treatments, such as transmyocardial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> (where a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beam is used to drill tiny holes in the wall 
              of the heart), suffer the same drawbacks as their predecessors, 
              being invasive, expensive, and associated with a high rate of complications.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Advantages and Safety of ECP</h2>
<p>
<p>
<p>A recent study of external counterpulsation involving patients 
              from seven university hospitals, on the other hand, showed that 
              ECP was both effective and without risk of serious side effects. 
              (The only reported side effect to date from ECP is chaffing of the 
              skin on the legs.) It was the conclusion of this study that "Enhanced 
              external counterpulsation reduces angina and extends <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to exercise-induced 
              ischemia in patients with symptomatic coronary artery <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. Treatment 
              was relatively well tolerated and free of limiting side effects 
              in most patients."<sup>19</sup> </p>
<p>ECP patients typically undergo one hour of treatment daily, five 
              days a week for seven weeks. In more advanced cases of ischemic 
              heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, such as severe triple vessel <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, it is not uncommon 
              for additional ECP treatments to be needed.<sup>20</sup> </p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Modern Bias Towards Invasive Procedures</h2>
<p>
<p>
<p>However, ECP is a non-invasive procedure, while the current bias 
              in conventional cardiology favors invasive therapies. Topol recently 
              described the prevailing preoccupation of using surgery to open 
              coronary arteries as nothing more than "coronary cosmetology."<sup>21</sup> 
              This bias towards surgical therapies is difficult to understand 
              when one considers that a procedure such as angioplasty, done over 
              500,000 times annually in the U.S., does not have the support of 
              studies that prove that this procedure decreases the risk of heart 
              attacks and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>.<sup>22,23</sup> Indeed, two major studies that 
              compared angioplasty with medical therapies both showed angioplasties 
              to be ineffective in preventing myocardial infarction and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. 
              , A recent meta-analysis that compared angioplasty to medical treatment 
              for non-acute coronary heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> found angioplasty of value 
              in reducing angina, but only at the cost of significantly increased 
              rates of myocardial infarction, need for coronary artery bypass 
              graft surgery and repeat angioplasties.<sup>24</sup></p>
<h2>The New <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">Concept</a> of Vulnerable Plaque-- Have We Been Operating 
              on the Wrong Lesions?</h2>
<p>Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons typically operate on "high 
              grade" occlusions of the coronary arteries (70-100% occlusions), 
              while ignoring lower grade lesions. Yet, heart attacks are most 
              commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaque that occludes 
              less than 50% of the vessel. Rupture of a 90% lesion with subsequent 
              heart attack is much less common.<sup>25</sup> Yet it is the 90% 
              lesion that gets the angioplasty, while the more dangerous 10-50% 
              lesions are ignored. The new <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of "vulnerable" atherosclerotic 
              plaque posits that the smaller deposits of cholesterol along the 
              walls of the arteries are far more dangerous than their larger, 
              older and more obstructive cousins. The smaller lesions tend to 
              be softer and more "vulnerable" to rupture upon exposure 
              to free radicals, with subsequent heart attack or stroke.<sup>26</sup>
</p>
<p>Due to the high failure rate of angioplasty alone, cardiologists 
              have turned to angioplasty with stent placement. Stents (tubes made 
              out of wire mesh that are inserted into arteries to help keep them 
              open) did not come into wide use until 1995, so studies regarding 
              their long-term effects do not exist. However, a recent study suggests 
              that stents cause inflammation of the walls of arteries that "may 
              have implications with respect to the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion of atherosclerosis 
              in coronary arteries."<sup>27</sup> Interestingly, this lack 
              of long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on stents has not decreased their use, and 
              stent placement has grown over the past few years into a multibillion-dollar 
              industry.<sup>28</sup> </p>
<p>The statistics for bypass surgery are sobering as well.<sup>29,30</sup> 
              The 22-year VA follow up study of coronary artery bypass surgery 
              for stable angina found that patients who underwent bypass surgery 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d neither long-term survival or symptomatic benefit.<sup>31,32</sup> 
              It has been estimated that up to 44% of bypass surgeries are done 
              unnecessarily or for equivocal <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s.<sup>33</sup> Graboys found 
              that, when second opinions were obtained prior to coronary artery 
              bypass surgery, as many as 50% of the surgeries could be safely 
              deferred or postponed indefinitely.<sup>34</sup> </p>
<p>One of the easiest determinants of cardiac function is measurement 
              of the "ejection fraction," the percentage of blood contained 
              within the left ventricle that is pumped out with each heartbeat. 
              Bypass surgery has been shown to be the most beneficial to those 
              angina patients with an ejection fraction of less than 50%. For 
              patients with an ejection fraction over 50%, there appears to be 
              no benefit, yet the majority of patients undergoing bypass surgery 
              have ejection fractions greater than 50%.</p>
<h2><i>Primum non nocere</i> - "First of all, do no harm"</h2>
<p>Throughout their training, medical students are cautioned again 
              and again: <i>Primum non nocere</i> -- "first of all, do no 
              harm." This cardinal rule of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> dates back to the days 
              of Hippocrates<sup>35</sup> and Galen. With regard to coronary artery 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, this fundamental principle would seem to dictate that physicians 
              should look first to treatments that are safe, simple and affordable 
              before proceeding with others that are dangerous, painful and costly. 
              Perhaps residency <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s train cardiologists to focus on invasive 
              procedures, leading to patients not being adequately screened prior 
              to undergoing angioplasty and surgery.<sup>36</sup> </p>
<p>There is ample evidence of bias towards more dangerous and invasive 
              therapies as first-line treatments for angina. One of my former 
              professors from medical school and an excellent cardiologist, Dr. 
              Richard Conti, exemplifies this bias as he notes that external counterpulsation 
              has great potential, but should <i>not</i> be first line therapy. 
              He encourages physicians to aggressively pursue revascularization 
              therapies first.<sup>37</sup> </p>
<p>ECP is recognized among many cardiology experts as a valid treatment, 
              and many cardiology groups around the country have ECP <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              in their offices. But the prevailing sentiment is that ECP should 
              be reserved for those patients who are not candidates for invasive 
              therapy or for cases where such surgery has been done and subsequently 
              failed. If ECP is safe and effective in cases where pharmacological 
              and surgical revascularization has failed, imagine its potential 
              in treating patients with less advanced or severe ischemic heart 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. </p>
<h2>Involving Patients in Treatment Decisions</h2>
<p><i>Primum non nocere</i>, first of all, do no harm -- the role 
              of physicians is to foster informed participation and allow patients 
              to become actively involved in the treatment decisions. Current 
              trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> are away from paternalistic informed consent 
              and towards informed decision-making, which emphasizes meaningful 
              dialogue between the patient and physician.<sup>38</sup> Patients 
              who are truly informed and take part in their treatment decisions 
              are more likely to be compliant. Let physicians inform patients 
              of all the treatment options available for ischemic heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. 
            </p>
<p>Lifestyle modifications such as diet, exercise, and stress management 
              should be tried first. Then if additional therapy is needed, present 
              the full spectrum of approved treatment options: prescription medications, 
              angioplasties, stents, bypass surgery <i>and ECP</i>, and let the 
              patient decide. ECP should not be treated as an ugly stepchild selected 
              only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Some might argue that in cases of angina, the stakes are too high 
              and there is no room to allow patients their choice of treatment. 
              Nease et al recently studied this issue of patient attitudes toward 
              treating their chronic angina.<sup>39</sup> Considerable variability 
              was found in patients' willingness to tolerate anginal symptoms. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers concluded that management of ischemic heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> 
              should not be based on the strict use of practice guidelines or 
              the severity of symptoms alone, but rather should take into account 
              the feelings and preferences of the patient.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While ECP is not a panacea and is not suitable for all patients, 
              there are many patients who could benefit from this safe and <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> 
              treatment and would indeed request it, if only they were informed 
              that it was available. When physicians discuss treatment options 
              for angina patients, they need to provide balanced presentations 
              and include full explanations of the pros and cons of all available 
              alternative therapies, not just the pros of one therapy and the 
              cons of another. </p>
<p>The optimal treatment plan should take into account the best available 
              scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> as well as the preferences of the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> patient 
              in a shared decision-making process. The <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> has come to include 
              discussion of ECP with cardiac patients as a safe, painless, inexpensive 
              alternative to invasive therapy.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The article was very informative.  I had bypass surgury 6 years ago, and I have been on an oral chelation therapy for the last 16 months due to 50% blockage in a non-bypassed artery.  I would have preferred to have chelation therapy originally but bypass was encouraged. 
<br>
When the latest blockage was discovered, I'm sure the cariologist would have inserted a stent had I not objected.  I had already signed the consent, voice my objection to the nurse before I went for he angiogram.  
<br>
My objection to the stent was based on seeing several people have the stents inserted and followed shortly after by bypass.  
<br>
I am now aware of ECP and if the arises, I will opt for this "new", "experimental" therapy.  
<br>
I'm also changing cardiologists.</p></td>

That is a wonderful article. I am sure a lot of people will find it informative. We manufacture ECP machines. We call it the IECP please visit <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614022725/http://iecp.in/" target="_blank">http://iecp.in</a> and if possible also take part in the forum which we have lately added.
