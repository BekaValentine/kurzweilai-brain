<div class="TeaserText">Business 2.0 editor James Daly interviews Raymond Kurzweil on what happens when machines become conscious.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published January 1, 1999 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051206013114/http://www.business2.com/" target="_new">Business2.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net February 22, 2001.</p>
<p>In your book, you predict that by 2019 the average $1,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> will match the power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Should we be excited by that, or scared? </p>
<p>It's simply a large challenge. And that's a conservative projection, by the way. At the beginning of the 20th century, we were doubling the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> every three years. That dropped to every two years in the '50s and '60s. Now we're doubling it every 12 months and it's likely to accelerate. This acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power won't automatically give us <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that are as intelligent as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, because the organization of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s resources--the way the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> is connected, its <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s--is equally important. Our whole culture and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a> also forms a key part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Yet this advance on the part of our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s provides us with immense and exciting opportunities. </p>
<p>For example?</p>
<p>Think of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> as a <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. It has allowed <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources to be shared in very dynamic ways. For example, I am sitting in front of my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> here and it's just flashing a cursor; 99.9 percent of its <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources are unused. Proposals like <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>' Jeni project, for instance, and others will allow all of those unused <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al resources on the Net to be harnessed into highly parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s (see "<a href="The%20Power%20Is%20Out%20There" target="_new">The Power Is Out There</a>," Premiere, p102). We already have more than the processing power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> on the Net, and soon we'll be able to call on that power through <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al--sharing proposals. You'll be able to apply the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al ability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> from your <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> simply by pulling in power from other <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that aren't being used at the moment. What does that do? Well, suddenly the harnessing of this vast <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is a much more important <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of an organization's success. </p>
<p>Let's look ahead. How will a company need to evolve? </p>
<p>We're seeing a trend toward what I call a "virtual" company. Increasingly, companies will be associations of individuals who are geographically separate but with a business relationship among each other. People won't necessarily belong to one company. And you will have flexible work groups that are not at all limited by geographic location. Think about this: Most of the wealth being created today is in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of products with no material form. So increasingly, natural resources are becoming less and less important. Mental resources, the ability to create <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, to master <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, to control <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> resources, is going to be the way that wealth is created.</p>
<p>What is the role of the big, dominant players of today--<a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>, Yahoo!, Intel? </p>
<p>An organization could still be large, as a sort of a pool of capital and resources, but it has to really provide a kind of dynamic, <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>ial environment within its organization to remain viable. <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> already does that well. It gives <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> to smaller groups. For example, at Word, the developer group is not a lot bigger than little companies. Basically, <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> emphasizes having small groups with highly talented people, giving them a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a>. Large organizations, in and of themselves, are not going to remain viable. They will increasingly represent just an umbrella concentration of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, in the form of companies of all different sizes within.</p>
<p>Sounds like some severe growing pains ahead. </p>
<p>That is what is behind this sort of international financial crisis. The business model that certain countries have been relying on doesn't work. Japan, for instance, is very manufacturing oriented. Its sophisticated manufacturing is the epitome of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>. It's a business model built on buying inexpensive raw materials and converting them into manufactured products, without an emphasis on the kind of intellectual property creation that is epitomized by <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a>. In <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> over the past 10 years, the new wealth in terms of market capitalization of companies is about a trillion dollars. That's not play money. That's real money. It's real wealth. I'm not saying there is no innovation in Japan, but the heart of the model is not innovation. The Japanese don't have <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a>. They don't have that kind of culture. Their economy and culture don't reward risk-taking and change. </p>
<p>How will the role of money change in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? </p>
<p>Money is a wonderful <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>. It's really a testament to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>' ability to give reality to abstract concepts-the concept of value. Because if visitors from another <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> were to come here, they would really have to understand some very deep, abstract notions to recognize this reality of money. Yet it's obviously a very powerful thing. Everybody respects it. People can have very different political views, ideological views, religious views, and disagree enormously on any subject you might mention, yet everyone respects money. It's a pretty remarkable phenomenon. </p>
<p>If you look at the trends of what people are paying money for and what money represents, it's increasingly representing the value of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. This goes back to my earlier point. Today, <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> really represent <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and its power over our environments. Increasingly, when people buy products they are paying for the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of those products, which is embedded in subtle ways. So that which is valuable, that for which we will exchange money, will simply represent the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. </p>
<p>Let's get back to the point you raised earlier about <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Can something create another thing more intelligent than itself? </p>
<p>There's no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why not. During the 21st century, the cutting edge of the creation of intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will move from humans designing intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to the more intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s creating their own next generation. But this is not an alien invasion of intelligent creatures. We'll become smarter by merging with our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s are already a pretty intimate part of our <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. If all the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s stopped functioning, society would grind to a halt. </p>
<p>Today, the stock market is already moving to <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s. I'm not just talking about <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> trading, which involves fairly simple formulas created by <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. Today, about 5 percent of the trades are done that way. If it was 2 percent last year and 0.5 percent the year before, at current trends, by the middle of the next decade, the majority of stock trading would be carried out by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, not using simple <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>-trading formulas, but really by doing their own sort of evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> analysis. </p>
<p>If <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s reach this level of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, what will constitute being human? </p>
<p>The issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> has always been a perplexing question. It will become more vexing when we have <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that have the subtlety, <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, and depth of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> response. The <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s today is very limited compared to a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being. Even our most complex <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are still a million times simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. But it is clearly going to change as we go through the first few decades of this next century. Our more advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will be based on the design of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, and we will have <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that appear to be conscious, will claim to be conscious (see "Big Ideas from Small Creatures," p100). In fact, they will claim to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and they will be very convincing and ultimately, they will be more intelligent than we are, so we will end up believing them. That's still not a scientific demonstration that they are conscious. So from a fundamental, philosophical perspective, we can't prove that these <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are not zombies, that they are conscious entities; but from a political and social perspective, we will believe that, because they will be very convincing. </p>
<p>Is there an inherent difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>? </p>
<p>Right now, we feel that our uniqueness--our "humanness," if you will--is simply a function of our <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. We see <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> as a billion-year drama that led to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, which is its grandest creation. But ultimately there is going to be no clear boundary between the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> world and the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> world. We've taken small steps in that direction already. We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s designed to rewire parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to suppress seizures. It's being used with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's disease</a>. We have cochlea implants, which replace the early auditory processing <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. One of the people I have an active working relationship with is deaf and has a cochlea implant, and I can hold phone conversations with him. Increasingly, we're going to be putting <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, in our brains to augment, replace, supplement, and bypass neural regions of our brains. Conversely, we're going to be building our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s based on <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. We have already been able to take clusters of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and emulate very precisely their input/output characteristics, creating an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that exactly mimics the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-processing characteristics of a cluster of hundreds of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. If we could do that with hundreds of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why we cannot scale that up to hundreds of billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. In fact, scaling <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s up from hundreds of something to billions of something is the type of task we do all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<p>So we will be, certainly in the second and third decades of the 21st century, building <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s based on our <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> and our scans of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. By 2029, we will be able to fully scan a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, all of that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on the interconnections and the wiring. That re-created <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> will claim to be the same guy who was scanned. It will claim to be Joe and will claim to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. </p>
<p>How do we prepare the next generation for these changes? </p>
<p>What we really need to give to our kids is the ability to create <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. That doesn't mean that everyone should become a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er. In fact, creating <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and culture in all of its forms--whether it's <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, writing, <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, work--it's becoming increasingly important. Children need to develop certain fundamental skills and the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and the ability to think abstractly. Rote <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> is not very useful. But we should really foster children to pursue their own talents and develop them in their own unique ways. The only way to create <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is to have a passion for something. People should pursue their passions.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>First in short form, I'll be happy to back up each step with plenty of arguments:
<br>
<br>
1) Awareness (or consciousness, and the subjective experience of color and sound as opposed to objective brain processes) is non-physical.
<br>
2) We human beings talk about awareness because we are actually aware, not because we are programmed that way (as a tape recorder might be).
<br>
3) So this is an example of the non-physical having impact on the physical.
<br>
(The term "physical" referring to what is described by the laws of physics as a set of mathematical formulas, a set of mathematical relationships between directly or indirectly measurable quantities) 
<br>
4) Therefore the laws of physics are not self-contained, and also consequently do not imply determinism (nor determinism plus randomness).
<br>
5) This must mean that there will always be significant, practical differences between an AI machine (as long as it is acting within the laws of physics) and the actions of human beings (including human intelligence).

As an example, an AI-computer could not perform this very line of reasoning. Since it can't realize step #1 on its own, it would hardly come to any of the following steps (on its own), which make an important statement about objective reality. Or not?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Norbert,
<br>
<br>
well...your argument is based on squarely on the acceptance of Cartesian dualism...
<br>
<br>
However there are many interesting theories that challenge this presupposition that the physical world and the psychological world are separate.
<br>
<br>
In fact many of the books I've listed in the thread on Quantum Consciousness cover this topic in great detail (see http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/show_thread.php?rootID=1832)
<br>
A particularly interesting book that relates to this topic is "I of the vortex - by Rodolfo R. Llinas".  He provides a VERY interesting theory on the development of consciousness.
<br>
But even if this dualism IS real, we don't know for sure that there IS anything that would prevent us from providing AI with a rich set of resources in both of these worlds.  Some would even say that the hardware / software divide is a step in this direction (although a very simplistic one).

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>We do experience dualism because of the way our brains work.  The signals that come into our bodies from outside in the form of light rays striking the rods and cones in our eyes and the air vibrating the hairs in our ears, etc., are turned into electrical signals that the brain analyzes and uses to create a map or model of the universe in which we live.  
<br>
<br>
The map and the universe are not the same.  The information we get about the universe is finite and dependent upon our ability to analyze the signals we receive about it.  In the sense that no two people create exactly the same world in their minds, there are multiple universes and because we create our world based on what we believe (based on our analysis) about what we see, hear, etc., no two people live in exactly the same universe.  But the universe you live in is inside your head.  The external universe is the one not created by anyone.  
<br>
<br>
That's why some people tie the universe they see to psychology and human creation.  These things do affect the world each of us lives in.  But I don't believe they affect the universe outside our brains.  We can only try to create ever more accurate models of that one.  Just keep in mind the fact that the map is NOT the territory.  It remains the same no matter what we think.  It's the inner world that constantly has to be revised as new information comes in.  We shouldn't confuse the two.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Grant,
<br>
<br>
I completely agree with Korzybski's "the map is NOT the territory".  But I don't think you can completely draw from it that the map doesn't influence the territory in ANY way.  Otherwise we would be completely incapable of action.  In fact our bodies are part of the territory too, and our map defnly affects them.  What I think about has a very strong influence on my brain chemistry indeed.
<br>
<br>
I'll accept the basic assumption that the "nature" of the universe doesn't change based on what we think...but this too is simply a map that could need updating.  Heisenberg's uncertainty principal and Einstein's general theory of relativity have interesting implications for that...and yes I know they are just maps too 8)
<br>
In fact if you look at how civilization (what we think) has completely reshaped the physical world in which we live (reality) then the two do not seem completely separate.  And perhaps our evolution towards the singularity (or singularities) is intensifying this effect.  With rich nanotech the gap between thought and changes in reality would become increasingly thinner.

I agree we change the world just by living in it -- as does every living thing on earth.  But I doubt we change the world just by thinking about it.  That requires physical labor and effort, although the plans we make, the machines we build and the changes we make are the result of thought.  And the more information we gather about the universe, the thinner the line becomes between our individual maps and that universe.  
<br>
<br>
We are more capable of changing the world to conform to our heart's desire than any other species.  But we are equally capable of changing it in ways that may kill us.  An article in yesterday's Union-Tribune newspaper said mankind has wiped out more species in the past few centuries than any force other than the meteor that wiped out the dinasaurs 65 million years ago.  I feel pretty sure that's not what we thought we were doing.  The force of thought on the world we live in is obviously a two-edged sword.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Actually I don't accept dualism,  and I hope my message didn't somehow imply that. 
<br>
<br>
The fact that one can count trees doesn't make them mathematical entities. A tree isn't dualistic because it's both living and countable. The impression that there are two worlds arises because there are so many aspects in our world which are describable mathematically that we often assume it is mathematical in nature.
<br>
<br>
However, most present day concepts of AI, especially the popular ones, rely on the assumption that intelligence is completely and entirely describable with mathematics.
<br>

Maybe I'll write more when I've taken a look at the thread you mentioned.

It was the "non-physical" comments that led me to thinking your comment was based on dualism...sorry to falsely accuse you 8)
<br>
<br>
You also wrote:
<br>

<br>
<br>
I think it's quite widely accepted within the AI community that intelligence/consciousness/self-awareness (depending on your semantic bent) may be an emergent property of the complexity of brain function.  While the complexity may be able to be completely described by mathematics the emergent properties are free to be amorphous and experiential.
<br>
<br>
In fact we have no way of knowing that our existing computers don't already have an experiential inner world based on emergent properties.  In the same way we don't know if cockroaches do either.  Without the ability to experience it, emergencies are almost meaningless.  Which leads me back down the road of dualism so I think I'll hop off here 8)

The way I'm using the term, it includes the ability to reflect on subjective experience and to discover that it has nonmathematical (and therefore nonphysical) aspects. It also has the ability to discern between fact, theory and belief, as I see it. However, in order to make a leap in understanding, a direct insight may be necessary. Still, the interpretation of this insight needs to be tested with rationality.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Quite right.  It is this "testing" of subjective experience with the rational mind which enables us to sort fact from fancy, reality from imagination.  Too many people buy into their "own" reality, and end up living in a dream.  When that dream becomes a nightmare, we call them insane.
<br>
<br>
The difficulty, as I see it, is that the rational mind tends to identify itself as the exclusive "self" and to argue forcefully against the inclusion of the emotional, sensual, or spiritual aspects of the self.  This can lead to an artificially "dry" personality and an overly critical system of beliefs and attitudes that blocks all further experience.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'm intrigued by your suggestion that 'awareness' is 'non-physical'. It doesn't exist, necessarily, in the same sense that an atom exists. 
<br>
<br>
But there are examples abundant in nature of physical phenomena that doesn't have a phsyical existence that is 'independent' ( in fact , particle physics would suggest that most material objects 'consist' of other things, including atoms). A table dosn't have an 'independent' physical existence, but it still exists.
<br>
<br>
A better example would be the surface of a body of water, for instance : it has properties of its own and exists but doesn't consist of anything ( there are no 'bits of surface' in a molecule : a water surface has aggregate origins only ).
<br>
<br>
Force fields 'exist' as well , but 'consist' of nothing ( recent theories seem to be trying to discount this ).
<br>
<br>
Just because some phenomena  doesn't have an 'independent' physical existence doesn't mean it can't have an objective physical existence : all that is required is that it has a relationship with physical matter of  some sort.
<br>
<br>
I think a better way of seeing consciousness would be to argue that it is a phenomena realized by the physical mechanisms of the brain. 
<br>
<br>
Consciousness then becomes a subjectively EXPERIENCED mental phenomena with an OBJECTIVE existence. These terms get confused.
<br>
<br>
Also the physical world is not the same thing as the theories that describe it. Theories change with time : we have no reason to assume the physical world underlying it does. The universe is not a mathematical object , just well described by mathematics.
<br>
<br>
But basically I agree with you that humans don't think like computers : we KNOW how computers 'think' anyway , whereas human thought is a long, long , way from being even remotely understood, or mechanized.

<br>
<br>
So far, I think these important points came together: 
<br>
(Let me know if you're missing one. It seems most are related to step #1 in my message.)
<br>
<br>
* The extent of mathematical description.
<br>
* The distinction between the map (the description) and the universe (the described), and at the same time, when we look at human intelligence (which means, at ourselves), that the map is [part of] the universe.
<br>
* The difficulty of applying the notion of 'existence' to subjective experience.
<br>
* Also I was "hopping" into the bookstore for "I of the vortex".
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure which philosophical water this might bring me into, but one might say that subjective experience is "happening" rather than "existing".   As in the book "I of the vortex", subjective experience might be called an event rather than an object. The question then is, with the event of a brain process (electrical activity of neurons), and the subjective experience of let's say vividly seeing a color, are these two distinct events or are they one and the same? If not, would that be dualism? If yes, would that render subjective experience scientifically irrelevant? Would subjective experience be like sugar-coating on the cake of objective reality, would they be two sides of the same coin, the inside and the outside of the same 'thing'?  Perhaps not being able to find all all the answers, which way should one go?
<br>
<br>
However interesting this is, I'll be visiting friends over the weekend, and so won't be able to continue here before next week. But be assured I'll try to respond to all these issues, as I see them as being closely related.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Some people insist it does, and generally its because they haven't been able to view subjective experience as havinga first person ontology AND a third person ontology at the same time : mental experiences are private in nature but originate objectively  in teh physical world.  But the same people wouldn't have a probelm with the atmic theory of matter, which is an assertion as to the existence of third party causes of the sensory data we experience eveery day known as matter : when somebody saw boiling water form steam,which then condensed to form water again,  a third party description was given by atomic hypothesists for an experience consisting of  visual, temperature and touch sense data - there is always in science split ontology between the experience of matter and the third party notion of its existence, but without the experience of the matter the third party description would not, of course , be possible.
<br>
<br>
This doesn't apply to matter either - motion , time , for instance, are theorised about but the primary understanding of them is through sense data. This nonetheless doesn't stop motion having a genuine third party existence.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>As I wrote last week, I'll take up the points we discussed. However, it's now a quite extensive area to discuss, so I'll make that attempt in more than one message. I think a good point to start would be the question of 'existence' or 'happening' of subjective experience, since if we discuss the question of whether subjective experience is a 'function' of the physical, it's good to be clear about what makes us say there actually is subjective experience in the first place. Fortunately or unfortunately, I think I'll have to somewhat appeal to common sense, which is a reason I'll be interested in any response.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is easier (at least as a starting point) to say that subjective experience is a fact, than to discuss whether it is an object, or an event of interacting objects (or fields), or something else.
<br>
<br>
So: The statement "I vividly see the color blue" can be 'true' or 'false' in the full sense of these words. It is a statement of a fact, not an idea (abstraction) and not a belief. I see it or I don't. If I said otherwise, it would be a lie (or a test ;-). It is also a valid statement in the sense that it gives actual information. It could be otherwise. In the specific sense of seeing a specific color at a specific time, it is of course possible that the color is simply not being seen at this time. 
<br>
<br>
In the general sense of seeing colors at all, it could also be otherwise. When we attentively look in a room where each object is, and then close the eyes, there may be an after-image for 1 or 2 seconds. When that is gone, we still have a pretty good idea of where-everything-is for several seconds. Our sensory organs could refresh this knowledge continuously, and we would always simply know where everything is without seeing it in color. For example when we know that there is tree around a corner, we can walk around this tree when we turn around the corner without looking at it.
<br>
<br>
So seeing in color is not an (at least not a very trivial) extrapolation of other facts, but it is a fact in itself. Interestingly, we can say so without scientific measurement or experiment, since we have direct, first-hand knowledge of this fact, hence the term 'first-person-ontology'. 
<br>
<br>
Since I see only 'my' colors, not 'yours', and you see only your colors, not mine, and a third person (scientist) sees neither, we call it subjective. However, you can verify these statements for yourself, so it is "inter-subjective", if that is a good word.
<br>
<br>
In summary, subjective experience is a fact. It's not an objective fact, but it is a fact. It might be called an inter-subjective fact.
<br>
<br>
Before going the next step, I'll start a new message, and first see what your response is, and give myself some time to collect the important points.

But there are two senses to mental pheneomena - the nature of the experience itself ( the 'quality' of the experience ) and its place in the universe ( brains casuse mental states). I don't know what this 'inter-subjectivity' is - it strikes me as being meaningless. Much eaiser to acknowledge the simpkle fact that mental states are subjective in quality : but that they exist in the universe at all makes them an objective fact.

So far I couldn't understand why you made the statement about seeing a primary colour being irreducible, especially since I didn't use the word 'consistency'. Perhaps we just misunderstood each other.
<br>
<br>
It was my major point that seeing a color is subjective. What is intersubjective is the realization that subjective experience is a fact. We cannot prove objectively that seeing a color is a fact - a point I wanted to say more about in the next message. I used the word intersubjective because every 'subject' who has a subjective experience can verify in the way I described that seeing a color is a fact. It cannot be verified by someone or something who does not see a color. The point is that we can communicate not only that we see a color, but that we can also communicate the line of reasoning that leads to the realization that it is a fact (rather than an idea, an abstraction, or a belief).</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Sorry about the 'colours' paragraph Norbert - it was meant to have the words 'I agree entirely with you' pre-pended to it.
<br>
<br>
"What is intersubjective is the realization that subjective experience is a fact. "
<br>
<br>
By that I take it that you mean subjective experience is an bjective fact of the world, like the nuclear reactions at the center of stars, for instance.
<br>
<br>
"We cannot prove objectively that seeing a color is a fact"
<br>
<br>
This is a question that resolves around the nature of objective proof. There is no formal objective proof of anything non-mathematical - even the theory of atoms presupposes some facts - the fact is we have a willingness to BELIEVE in the existence of atoms, backed by an overwhelming body of supporting evidence - but as we can't see atoms or sense them we are left with no alternative to draw suppositions from separate facts. Not dissimilar to jurisprudence , where jurists who weren't at the scene of the crime draw conclusions of BELIEF from supporting evidence. But 'proof' in a mathematical sense of anything in the physical world ? You can forget it. 
<br>
<br>
Our 'proof'is belief based upon reason, nothing more, nothing less, and the scientific method provides supporting evidence for our beliefs of a high quality ( or so we believe ).
<br>
<br>
And here we see the trouble ( which isn't actually any trouble at all ) with theories surrounding subjective mental phenomena - the science of brains is completely pitiful.
<br>
<br>
So as the quality of mental life is private, and as there is no OBJECTIVE , conventional theory of the causal mechanisms of SUBJECTIVE mental phenomena in the brain, there is a belief that subjective mental phenomena are inherently incapable of being  'measured' and so that I can't have 'proof' that Norbert, is , for example, a conscious being.
<br>
<br>
But I don't have 'proof', in the mathematical sense for the existence of atoms : just scientific evidence. And the stumbling block when it comes to arguing for the objective existence of internal mental states is the lack of scientific evidence or theory relationg to brain function. But this I believe is a sociological question as much as anything else : we have come to believe that scientific evidence IS proof , in a mathematical sense , when it clearly is not and indeed, cannot be. 
<br>
<br>
When people use the argument "you cannot prove the existence of other people's mental states" what they are really doing is conjoining in an inconsistent way the two most important facts about mental states : the fact that are subjective in QUALITY, and the OBJECTIVE sceintific causal evidence just isn't there.  In some sense it's true that we can't "prove the existence of other people's mental states" but its important to remember that this is NOT axiomatic but based upon the backwardness of brain science, coupled with a confusion over the QUALITY of mental states.
<br>
<br>
Its my belief that in time , as brain science improves, these notions of the 'unprovability' of internal mental states will disappear.
<br>
<br>
So as the basis of our 'proofs' is belief based upon reason, in the absence of useful brain science our conclusions must be drawn from reasoning.
<br>
(i) Is John conscious ?
<br>
(ii) If yes, does John believe in the existnce of an external world populated by being similar to himself ( there is no 'proof' for either of these facts, incidentally )
<br>
(iii) If yes, does John consider himself, or has he had any reason to consider himself, a particlarly special example of the human race ?
<br>
(iv) If no, is is therefore reasonable to assume that Norberts' mental life is similar to his own ?
<br>
<br>
The answer to this I believe is "yes" - I can'ty make an OBJECTIVE case for my own basic uniqueness, so I have to assume that Norbert is conscious too, as I am.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ok, let's talk about correlation. ;-) 
<br>
<br>
The 3D image which we see (subjectively) obviously contains a lot of information about the outer world. That's why we call it perception. As far as I understand, light is reflected by objects, focused by the optical eye and transformed into nerve impulses in the retina, which are then processed in the brain by electro(chemical) activity of neurons, and somehow stored in memory. Certain medical tests indicate that our subjective experience isn't based on the eye directly, but on more or less specific brain processes. So the shape and form, the metrics, of this 3D image are obviously correlated to brain processes. Which color we see at a certain point correlates (of course) to the frequency of light via something like the firing patterns of a group or specific neurons.
<br>
<br>
However there are also aspects for which there are no correlations: That we have 'subjective seeing' at all (rather than just knowing where-things-are), and how a color looks subjectively. Also the virtual space that we experience seems to have such characteristics, but that's probably really difficult to grasp. When I say "how a color looks", I mean that blue looks like blue and red looks like red. Why shouldn't blue look like red and red look like blue? How could we verify that the color you call blue looks the same to you as the color that I call blue looks to me? Perhaps there is someone who sees with the experience of (what I call) sound and hears in (what I call) colors, these two qualities of subjective experience being exchanged? Maybe it's random and half the population experiences it one way, and the other half of the population the other way, and at the same time the brain processes might be identical. How could we tell it is not so, or who would be in which group?
<br>
<br>
As these characteristics are qualities rather than quantities, I'd say there are non-mathematical variables in subjective experience. Certainly there are variables. Or not?
<br>
<br>
Consider the following less-than-perfect analogy: a 3 dimensional structure is projected onto a 2 dimensional surface. The projection on the 2D-surface provides the information for a mathematical-physical description, ignoring for the moment what the 3rd dimension might be. The 2D-description would have accurate information, but not all the information. If the 3D-structure is flat or parallel (all the objects have the same height), then there would be no important information lost, and the 3D-structure would be well-described by the 2D-description. However, if the information in the 3rd dimension is non-trivial, the 2D-description would be incomplete in a way that matters. 
<br>
<br>
This, I'd say, is probably the case for all living beings, and certainly it is so for human beings.

As you rightly pouint out ( and as I'd pointed out in the previos email as a supportive point )  the experience of red is red - pure semantic , an experience with no content. 
<br>
<br>
ALl the primary colors are the same. This is the evidence, were it needed , to be very suspicious abou the notion that the brain has just 'processes' of a mathematical kind - the experience of blue would have to be 'connected' to some other experiernce , which it clearly is not. The experience of blue is semantical ONLY - inplying that subjective mental experiences cannot be rooted in 'software' which has only formal, symbolic content ( syntax ) and must be connected to core pheneomena with 'absolute' meaning'.
<br>
<br>
The same goes for ermotional content - anger, fear, love etc can only really be experienced - they are semantical only.
<br>
<br>
I think you think Norbert, that I am disagreeing with you on the notion of the quality of mental states but I am not. What I think I haven't pointed out clearly enough to you is that there is a difference between the EXPERIENCE  of subjective mental activity ( which as you rightly point out is qualitative ) and its OBJECTIVE existence in nature. It maye be EXPERIRNCED subjectively , but these EXPERIERNCES have an OBEJCTIVE cause in brain processes. Where I would differ with most of the people on these pages is the NATURE of those brain processes. They would say brain processes are computer prograns : I would say the brain is a physical object in the real world that produces physical phenomena in the real world, namely suibjective mental states. And it would appear that , from our probing of brains and our current understanding ( poor as it is ) that these mental states correspond to firings of neurons in the complex physical matter of the brain. Quite where , and at what point of neural activity , in whar kind of physical environment , mere chemical objects start to develop sentience is the current target of a great deal of research .</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Yes, you have explained before that you see subjective experience merely as "EFFECTS" of brain physics, but it seems to me that you missed the point of my responses. Also, we are using some terms differently.
<br>
<br>
Since for you subjective experience is flatly the effect of brain physics, you don't see much of a point to talk about this 'effect' in itself. However, it has been one of the crucial points of my discussion to show that there is much more than just an 'effect', and so when I use the term 'subjective experience' (or seeing-in-color), I'm referring directly to just what you call 'EFFECT', only this, examining it in itself.
<br>
<br>
The explanations you have given flatly pre-assume the very point I've been discussing in my previous messages. Speaking in the analogy of my last message, you are stating (so to say 'a priori') that there is no relevant information in the "3rd dimension" of this analogy.
<br>
<br>
As a side note, I'm not sure whether you are aware of my point that 'physical' implies 'mathematical': Todays laws of physics are formulated as mathematical relationships between (measurable) quantities. 'Physical' is generally understood in the context of the science of physics, meaning that there is nothing else (relevant) to the 'physical' than what the mathematical laws of physics are reflecting (at least in principle, of course new laws are expected to be discovered continually.)
<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell from the philosophical literature I've come across, quite a good amount of it states that subjective experience is not much of itself (for example Dennett's "Consciousness explained"). My view is that this impression is based on the attempt to 'measure' subjective experience against 'objective' criteria. My personal impression is that many thought-experiments, the way they are presented for example by Dennett, simply miss the point of what might constitute a non-trivial characteristic of subjective experience in itself. Also, that there actually 'is' subjective experience, and that this is a meaningful statement of a fact, seems to be generally under-acknowledged (apparent for example in quotes of Wittgenstein). These are points which I have addressed in my previous messages.
<br>
<br>
Also I think I have now addressed all the "important points" that I have promised to respond to early in this discussion. From my point of view, the state of this discussion is "q.e.d.", as my mathematics teacher asked us to write when we had completed our line of conclusive reasoning.
<br>
<br>
Between us two, I think, the crucial point to discuss would be (if we want to continue) whether 'subjective experience' is just an 'effect', or a non-trivial, non-physical dimension to the world which is our live.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>If you read my posts Norbert you'll see that I've been talking about the 'effect in itself' non-stop since the start of this duiscussion.
<br>
<br>
I KNOW mental effects are subjective, qualitative and non-mathematical. I have been arguing this fact on these pages for months as the basis for the belief on my part that mental effects cannot be the result of the effects of mathematical objects such as computer programs. Consciosness is a natural phenomena, not a mathematical object, and the ontology of mathematical objects will not allow the creation of physical phenomena from computer programs : such an assertion is absurd. The consequences of this absurdity for some AI enthusiasts like Dennett, is to assert, quite simply , that conscisoness and mental phenemona don't exist ( or are 'illusions'- a very clever illusion - sounds like consciousness to me ).
<br>
<br>
For your part it appears you have made another classic AI assumption  - that matter itself consists of mathematical objects, when it does not. Your definition of physics is plain wrong.
<br>
Matter consists of matter. Matter is not a mathematical object.That matter which is understood and known about has been theorised astonishing succesfully using mathematics , but that does not make matter inherently mathematical : it makes our models of matter inherently so. That matter is not mathematical is why physics cannot cease to be, as scientifioc proof and mathematical proof are not the same thing.
<br>
<br>
There IS something special about the 'effect in itself' - I have been arguing this for a long time. But there are two salient facts that you still have not digested 
<br>
<br>
(i) The quality of mental effects is in an ontology of mental effects
<br>
(ii) The causality of mental effects is not in the same ontology as that of the 'quality of mental effects' - it is in the ontology of the phsyical realm - mental pheneomena exist in the universe and are caused by it, or if they don't can you tell exactly whereabout you are sitting when you write your emails ? Where are your effects residing ? Had a real-world, phsyical drink of alcohol recently ? Did you notice any difference between your pre-drink state and post drink state ? The only differnce was caused by the change in the phsyical environment of your brain - so you must admit there has to be a connection somewhere !

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John, let me try to clarify how well I understand your points. Actually, I was surprised to read that you also consider it impossible that a computer program produces mental effects (maybe I shouldn't say that as a software engineer). So we agree on more than I thought, although I'm really not fond of the term 'mental effects' since I don't see these as 'effects'. I'm aware (and appreciate) however that we agree on subjective experience being qualitative and non-mathematical. When you are talking about "ontology of mental effects", I assume you are referring to the so-called first-person ontology.
<br>
<br>
John, of course I'm aware of the difference between 'laws of physics' and 'physical reality'. (I wonder why nobody suspects dualism right here ;-)
<br>
<br>
Let's take an electrical field as an example. I must take it that you are trying to point out that its nature is not 'mathematical', but 'electrical'. I assure you, I understand that. In your first response to me, you wrote: "The universe is not a mathematical object, just well described by mathematics". So when I say that subjective experience is non-physical because it is non-mathematical, perhaps you would prefer me to say "Subjective experience is not well described by mathematics and therefore also not well described by the laws of physics" ? Or when I say "physical implies mathematical", you would prefer me to say "being-well-described-by-the-laws-of-physics implies being-well-described-by-mathematics" ? Do you think that when I'm writing that subjective experience is non-mathematical, that that would also apply to electrical fields since they are electrical rather than mathematical? In this case I would have to ask you to re-read all my messages.
<br>
<br>
Let me examine the comparison to electrical fields further. 
<br>
<br>
One might think that in the same way that mathematics can't describe blueness, they also can't describe electricalness, so there would be no difference (except for the additional first-person ontology). One might think that in the same way that mathematics might describe the amount of blue in a color, rather than what blueness is, mathematics also describe only the strength of an electrical field, not what electricalness is. Then the only difference would be the first-person ontology. Again, that fully misses the point, and again I would have to ask you to re-read all my messages. But this mistake would be much harder to understand, especially, I guess, if one has developed a habit of thinking this way. We haven't talked at all about what blueness 'is', at least I haven't. What I'm referring to is what blue 'looks like', to you or me. Blueness means to me what blue looks like to a human being, not what it 'is'. (Hopefully I could express this clearly, I haven't talked much about this point explicitly.)
<br>
<br>
Once we have clarified all this, we can then talk about your beverages. ;-)</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Norbert - I'be neen talking about what'blueness' is, believe me !
<br>
<br>
Blueness is qualitative - it has no consistentcy - it is all semantic. It can't be 'summed' from other componenents. The primary colors as EXPERIENCE are a good example of why brains can't be computer programs - what is the experience of red other than red ? How do you explain red to a blind man who's never been able to see ? Simple, you can't - and that's the nature of subjective mentality. How do you describe the feeling of fear to somebody who's never had it ? Simple, you can't - and emotions are similar to color experiences, in being irreducible.
<br>
<br>
I think you are close to the point I'm trying to make. Physics is a correspondent discipline : its actually less informative than a lot of people think. It tells us about the behviour of the phsyical world rather that what the world  actually is.  We know matter is 'mass-energy', according to current theory, but what is 'mass-energy' ? Pass - the predicate is never a possibility in Physics. So your example is a good one - physics tells us what electrical fields do , not what they are. And that 'do' theory of electrical fields originated from oobserving actual fields in practice. Electrical fields were not predicted , not 'caused' by anything , yet have features that can be measured and which allow a mathematcial analysis.
<br>
<br>
We have never found what 'causes' electrical fields, in a sense, but even if we did it would have to lead to a decomposition into another 'vector' ( particles, force fields ) that have no 'cause' in themselves. The 'IS' question is never answered by physics , and its imoportant to remember this, as othewise one may be inclined to think of the world as a mathematcal rather than phsyical entity.
<br>
<br>
Similarly by observing the brain we know that the firings of neurons and neural activity have massive impact upon subjective mental states. We know that changing the chemical environemnt of the brain causes severe changes in the pattern of neural firngs and the subsequent subjective mental effects. We know that some chemicals act as neurotransimtters and their deficiency or excess can lead to distorted mental states such as depression. If we take the general scientific principle of correspondence ( used in physics as much as anywhere else ) to connect the brain's activity to subjective mental states, it will be clearer, I believe, to see what third party observables ( neural firings, electrical brain activity ) correspond with the existence of subejctive effects. 
<br>
<br>
We can't account for the NATURE of the subjective effects in themselves ( we can't 'create' subjective mental effects from 'summing' the activity of neural firings ) we can only use correspondence between the third person, observable ontological factors ( neural firings ) and the first person experiential ontological factors. You can't make apples out of oranges : we can't use third party mathematical/physical nmodels to generate or deduce first party/subjective mental phenomena( I think this is actually your whole point ) . But you don't have to - all we are doing here is confusing the need for an actual compositional theory of 'subjective mentality' that we wouldn't require of, say, an electrial field- we don't need compositional theories of electrical fields in place in order to be able to study them. We know how to 'produce' ( a better word would be something like 'localise' ) them and how to tweak them in order to get measurements : but we don't know what they actually ARE ( answer I suppose , is that they ARE what they ARE )  Subjective mentality is no different : its associations are with brains. We don't need to know more than that to study it. The science will reveal itself with further study - and this is the main problem - with the science in the dark, silly therories like strong AI or religious theories like dualism can run rampant without any real constraints .

That's not my major point. It would have been one of my major points many years ago. I need to consider what to say without repeating myself...my 'conditions' for "beverages" are not met, yet. ;-).
<br>
<br>
For now, just this: In terms of my previous analogy, you do acknowledge that there is a "3rd dimension", also that it is non-zero, but you take it as a constant, not as a variable. As I see it nowadays, that's like making half a step, leaving one foot in the air.

(i) Do you believe that brains are important in the creation of subjective nmental effects ? Or are you ,as they say , a 'dualist' ?
<br>
<br>
(ii) Is your 3D/2D analogy akin to the notion that models cannot lead to subjective mental effects as there is 'something missing' in a flat third party ( syntactical ) description ? That there are things about subjective mentality ( the 3D position' ) that can't be seen from a 2D position ( mathematical modelling ) ?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John, first, when you use the term 'mental effects', you are presupposing the very point I'm discussing. Before I would discuss 'mental' in general, I want to stick to examining subjective experience of 'perception' for a long way.  Otherwise, I don't mind switching to your 'format' for a moment:
<br>
<br>
about (i): I don't see how the 'creation' of subjective experience makes the difference between dualism and non-dualism, once it's there. The point I'm discussing is whether this subjectiveness is trivial or non-trivial. I see awareness as one or more additional non-trivial dimension(s) to the one and only world which is our life, as I have already written.
<br>
<br>
about (ii): I think the answer is yes. Just like, as you say, a computer program can't produce an electrical field - without help, in the same way the physical forces gravity, strong and weak kernel force, and electro-magnetic force (or any other force which is well-described mathematically) can't produce awareness or subjective experience - without help.
<br>
<br>
about (iii): I think it can't be completely understood from the third-person view, and some (who knows how many) aspects can't be understood from the third person view at all. It requires careful study from the first person view.

<br>
As for (ii), I think that a 'common-sense' scientific view of 'mental life'  if you prefer, is part of our universe. De facto, it is within science's remit to study it. 
<br>
<br>
I think the key point for me is (iii).  Science never gives total 'understanding' - just pictures. That we can't currently 'understand' the mechanism for the correlation between brain events and mental events is no different to not 'understanding' the mechanism correlating negative electrical fields with electrons. WHy do electrons have negative electrical fields ? Don't know, because they do, thats' why. Greater light may be shed on the reasons 'why' but ultimately Physics is a model driven science , syntactical and incapable of passing on total understanding.
<br>
<br>
But I don't see any reason for giving up before we've even started. They maybe some huge brick wall in the way never to be resolved , but we won't know until we start will we ?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John, the question of correlation is a very interesting one, and revealing in terms of the relationship between subjective experience, the brain, and the laws of physics. As I've written, in perception there is obvious correlation. I agree with you that chemical factors influence not only perception, but also mental processes (slowing down reaction time, for example). That is also obvious in the practical sense, and science has given us a lot of information in these matters. I would assume that there is a broad range of correlations, including in the mental events or processes of thinking, remembering, etc.
<br>
<br>
So I'm not trying to discount this, yet discussing the question whether there are also areas which are not conceptually covered by the model of correlation.
<br>
<br>
With your example that "one cannot explain the color blue to a blind man", we agree that a mathematical model cannot describe the qualitative aspects of subjective experience, such as what the color blue looks like to you or me. We also agree that the complexity of a computer program in itself will not magically create something like either an electrical field or subjective experience. That goes a long way.
<br>
<br>
The obvious correlation between what the light coming to our eyes, its processing in the brain, and subjective experience extends only to the selection of the color, not to what the color looks like to the person. To illustrate this a bit, consider that our bodies are similar, but not exactly the same. Our eyes are a bit different, our ears are a bit different, and so on. So it seems very possible that also our subjective experience may differ a bit. At the same point of a 3D-image we see, we will both call the color we see at that point "blue", but your experience of seeing-blue may be a bit different than my experience of seeing-blue. This difference would not necessarily be in the color-space it could also be like the difference between color and sound, a little bit, even though it's difficult to imagine for either one of us. I'll have to admit that you could say that any such difference could theoretically be correlated to a corresponding difference in neuronal events, which in turn might be describable mathematically in terms of physics.
<br>
<br>
However, there is no imaginable way to verify this hypothesis, neither today nor in the future. The reason being that the qualitative aspects of subjective experience in the first person ontology cannot be quantitatively measured in the context of the third person ontology relating to the science of physics. Or expressed more simply, statements about qualitative characteristics cannot be verified by quantitative measurements. Such quantitative measurements are the basis of the science of physics, they are what makes physics a science, rather than a philosophy among other philosophies.
<br>
<br>
This means one cannot make a scientific statement about the correlation extending to the 'personal' look of a color, only to which color is selected. Such a correlation is not impossible, but insisting on this assumption would go in the direction of closed dogmatic belief systems, which I'm sure is not what you want. Scientifically, I'd say, there is no other option than to leave this question open. (Which has interesting implications in itself.) Otherwise, there would be a conflict with the statement  "'What blue looks like to you or me' cannot be described mathematically", since that is the statement from which this conclusion is derived. So, I guess, I'm saving us both from contradicting ourselves.
<br>
<br>
There is more to say, for example regarding the comparison of our understanding of electrical fields vs. our understanding of seeing-in-color, but I'll leave that for future messages.

I doubt that this is a restricting scientific term as they key pouint is control : there is no control over what a person as subjective viewer sees. Stick the eiffel tower in front of somebody and that's all they see, like it or not. Paint it red ( maybe even 'objectively' measured by a wavelength measurement of the light coming of the paint ) and everybody stood in front of a red eiffel twoer will see a red eiffel tower, whether they like it or not. You are assuming that it is impossible to define an objecticve set of crtiteria for establishing a test of subjective qualities, and this is not a justified restriction.
<br>
<br>
Assuming that most people's sbjective experiences are the sane , or very similar, is justified by our own experiences. When peoople don't react or describe the same things we do, we notice it. So we can assume that most people see green pretty much the same way , in much the same way that we can assume holding a lighted candle to their backsides will hurt them. The only way we can object to this assumption ( and ALL science must make some assumptions at some point ) is if we know in detail about how brain processes work and how they produce wide and fundamentally  differing experirnces in mentall healthy human beings - but we don't, and as we can only go on our experirnces, there is no reason to assume most people are pretty much the same.
<br>
<br>
No matter how you try Norbert you always seem to be mixing ontologies in a way that is simply not necessary. You always take subjective experirnce's first person qualities and decide arbitrarily that it can thus be excluded from third party investigation. Too restrictive and unnecessary ! We know that in addition to being a first person EXPERIENCE mental events are part of the universe and thus have a third person existence. Making some basic assumptions ( such as subjective reality between pretty much the same for most people, and the eiffel tower for me looking much like the eiffel tower for you ) we can thus incorporate them into a third party study. 
<br>
<br>
We will then start the long process of gleaning the nature of subjective mentality from brains , in much the same way that phsyics gleans more of a picture of matter, but never, ever gaining what may be termed as 'understanding'

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>John, it has nothing to do with mixing ontologies. You are missing the simple fact that what can be verified is that we will identify the color of the eiffel tower as black (last time I checked). But we cannot verify that seeing-black is the same to me as seeing-black is to you, subjectively. You might argue that there is no need to do so, and my point is only that this question needs to be left open. I'm not arguing that it is definitely not so.
<br>
<br>
To your plausibilty argument that we can assume that apparently we are similar, I answer with the plausibity argument that we are a little bit different in most respects.
<br>
<br>
So I maintain that you are not making a scientific statement, rather telling a fairy tale to scientists happy, but it won't.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Norbert, I'm no fary tale teller I assure you !
<br>
<br>
All knowledge is based upon faith to some extent. Is life a dream ? Ultimately I don't know because I can't prove otherwise. Is there an external world in which other people exist ? Are those people pretty much like me ? I think so, although again I can't prove it : it is possible I'm living in some huge dream. The entire basis of science has rested upon this belief as these for centuries : they are taken as read, but remain incapable of any logical proof. Science is based upon faith : its methods are more sophisticated than religion but its ability to provide understanding just as limited. We can say 'how the universe' but not 'why'.
<br>
<br>
One of the other big cornerstones of science is commonality : the idea we can take things that are simliar and analsye them as a collection.We construct a 'superclass' representation of the commonality and this forms the basis of our third party analysis. Atoms, gas clouds, planets, ants - we recognise objects in the world and group them by commonality and end up with the predicate. There is no reason why human mental experiences should not fall into the class of a collectable phenomena available for analysis in the time-honoured and very succesfull methods of science. 
<br>
<br>
We know that the exprience itself cannot be measured : no problem, science rarely directly measured anything anyway. The radius of an atom is not measured with a ruler : it is measured by using equipment based upon a scattering theory of light combined with a theroty of atomic structure. Our 'atomic radius' is strictly speaking notional indeed, the product of centuries of investigation and theoretical work. 
<br>
<br>
There is no reason to suppose that mentally subjective events , along with other directly unobservable events , such as atomic radii , won't succumb to the combination of investigation, experimentation and theoretical analysis that so far every other phenomena in the universe has succumbed to. It may take decades : it may take centuries  : but that no progress could ever be made would be highly unlikely. And of course there are differences between people : but is it really reasonable to assume that my mental life is vastly different from my parents ? I look like like them and I'm contructed from pretty much the same stuff. My guess is we see the world pretty nmuch the same way - and I have absolutely no reason to believe otherwise , which is why I'm using this standard physical form of written language to communicate the contents of my subjective mentality to yours, and , I would suggest you are doing likewise. </p></td>

<br>
<br>
As for why I introduced the nature of science as regards this issus - I think the question of mental subjectivity raises a lot of issues that are quite fundamental where science is concerned. Broadly speaking I think AI enthusiasts in particular forget that physics and mathematics are paintings of reality , and they frequently confuse a duck for a painting of a duck, justifying it on the grounds that they're stood too far away to notice the difference ( a classic example of this being the 'silicon signal transmitter' thought experiment that Chalmers may refer to ).  
<br>
<br>
In your case I think it was important to raise the issue as you seem to think that making assumptions about mental subjectivity having universal features was invalid, whereas syuuch assumptions of universality are made in science all the time , in order to start the 'model' ball rolling. I also wanted to persuade you that such an assumption was based upon 'reasonable belief' such as Bertrand Russell talks about, namely that the broad feutures of mental life amongs humans are similar, much as their bodies are.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi guys,
<br>
<br>
Well I see I've missed quite a bit of development in this ongoing debate 8)
<br>
<br>
NOTE TO DEV TEAM: I wish the Mind-X forum allowed you to be notified of ANY post to a thread and NOT JUST posts replying to your own comments...seems like a vain presupposition that I'm only interested in reply's to my own comments 8p
<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the debate at hand.  Here are some interesting ideas perspectives I've found on these issues recently.  Forgive me if I reference heavily, but there's alot of work that describes these points far more eloquently than I ever could.
<br>
<br>
1. Bill Adams outines a good case for a new endeaver entitled "The Psychology of Consciousness" - http://home.earthlink.net/~adamswa/intro.htm
<br>
<br>
In order to do this he asserts that a Science of Consciousness is not likely to be developed and outlines what he believes the limitations of a Neural Correlates of Consciousnes (NCC) approach are.
<br>
<br>
2. Susan Blackmore outlines in The Meme Machine (based largely on Dawkins and Dennett's work) the thesis that the self, logically the key to self-consciousness is the by-product of evolutionary processes acting upon symbolic replicators.  
<br>
<br>
She goes to great length to outline how these symbolic replicators may have come about (crossing the symbolic threshold).  She then outlines the evolutionary theory approach that variations that increase the longevity, fecundity and fidelity of a replicator are likely to be favoured in the selection process and therefore spread more successfully. Based on this framework she builds a compelling case for why we developed such large brains and even language itself.  
<br>
<br>
This line of reasoning also suggests that our type of consciousness makes sense for and clearly benefits the diffusion of these symbolic replicators.
<br>
<br>
3. Rodolofo Llinas outlines in the "I of the Vortex" a strong thesis about how consciousness and our predictive ability developed as an extension of autonomy and the sensorimotor feedback loop.
<br>
<br>
4. Michael Benedikt in a paper in 1992 (see http://www.ar.utexas.edu/center/benedikt_articles/cityspace.html) outlines a very interesting thesis about how our internal space (another view of consciousness that fits with Blackmore and Llinas' theses) may have developed as a computational emergent property of complexity.  
<br>
<br>
He asserts that information and space are inseparable and that as the amount of information in our 3d space increased our sensorimotor systems were forced to fold space within our "self" to handle this complexity.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on this meshwork of interrelated ideas I'd like to propose the following chain of ideas/assertions.
<br>
<br>
Subjective reality is created by our sensorimotor system creating sense based re-presentations to our "self".
<br>
<br>
That our subjective reality is the sum of these re-presentations and can therefore ONLY be accurately perceived from within this sensorimotor system.  And that it's the sum that's important e.g. a full body view of consciousness not just a small area like our brain.
<br>
<br>
<br>
That this suggests that there is a Cartesian duality and that 2nd or 3rd person re-presentations of this 1st person "reality" are by their very nature distorted.  Korzybski's "the map is not the territory" already highlights that the 1st person view is mediated through the senses and therefore only a flawed model of objective reality.
<br>
<br>
However, as Dennett's "stances" (physical, design and intentional) approach shows we can develop useful predictive models based on these 2nd and 3rd person views.  We just can't prove that they are true or not without fully (spatialy and sensorily - comments Tomas?) becoming the original 1st person.  Something that is currently well beyond our abilities.
<br>
<br>
As for the problem of Descartes's Cartesian interactionist dualism (e.g. the question of how mind and body interact) I propose the following.
<br>
<br>
If our consciousness is an emergent property of the complexity of our sensorimotor system then this sensorimotor system (as complexity theory suggests) is highly succeptible to variations in initial conditions.  
<br>
<br>
In a massively complex system like this it would only take miniscule changes in these re-presentations to change any outcome.  
<br>
<br>
If this were a fluid and self-reflexive system where re-presentations about the re-presentations are utilised (as it would subjectively seem to be) then the scale of these effects and outcomes could be large enough to explain human behaviour and all its weird by products.  Especially if this is viewed from a meme/gene co-evolution perspective.
<br>
<br>
Add to this epistatic effects of stacked memes and genes and the fact that the external environment is a massively complex system too and I believe we have a good argument for very complex and self organising emergent properties.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Or not 8)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi John,
<br>
<br>
&gt; can you create natural phenonmena from mathematical objects ? 
<br>
<br>
I'm actually suggesting that abstract re-presentations combine to create world views.  
<br>
<br>
Mathematics is simply an abstract world view.  Not real...just a map of reality.
<br>
<br>
So from this perspective, that's sort of a circular question.  Also I'm not quite sure exactly what you mean by "natural phenomena"?
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; How can 'systems' create subjective experiences such as 'the color red' ?
<br>
<br>
Clipped from http://members.aol.com/nonverbal3/primate.htm
<br>
Climbing cues. Visual learning is the hallmark of the primate brain. Foraging in trees (and using sight rather than scent) to find colorful fruits and berries went hand-in-hand with remembering where and what to pick. Unlike birds which fly directly to food spotted in trees, primates must chart a clever route through labyrinthine vines, limbs, and leaves. Mentally, they must navigate from point A to point B by decoding the branchways from many angles. (N.B.: In their 3D world, primates became skilled arboreal navigators. Today's monkeys, e.g., have sharp color vision, depth perception, and enhanced memory to recall the location of edibles scattered among forking branches and twisting vines.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is just one of the suggested steps our brains took in developing as the heart of our re-presentation based sensorimotor system.  To be able to do this we would have to have developed the ability to build simulated re-presentations in our mind of the external world.  Not just process the direct sensory input, but build actual simulations.  Some people call these meta models.
<br>
<br>
So our perception of  the "colour red" is received as input data, processed via our senses and delivered in an edited form to our brain.  Our subjective experience of that is built based upon the complex neural networks that recognise patterns and build our internal re-presenations (self-reflexivity) based on our experiential history and current context.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our selfplex (complex of symbolic replicators that inhabits our brain) then builds an internal narrative to enhance and justify this subjective experience.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our brain also uses submodalities (the experiential qualities like size, location, shape, tempo etc) to encode meaning into our sensory based re-presentations.  Most people when prompted can edit these submodalities which then generate changes the nature of their subjective experience. (I can point you to alot of information on this specific area if you want).
<br>
<br>
<br>
This then suggests to me that there is a strong causal link between these re-presentations and the emergent property we call subjective experience.

I can try and translate it to another sensory rep system by saying that red is a warm colour (a blunt synaesthesia).  But it's blatantly not the same.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi John,
<br>
<br>
Since we're discussing the detail of perception I need to clarify what you mean by some terms...sorry if it appears pedantic...
<br>
<br>
&gt; So if the experience of red is subjective
<br>
<br>
At a certain level of abstraction, but the initial sensory data received and generated by our sensory organs is probably "fairly" common across people.  Where this line of similarity ends is what most of the cognitive people debating colour perception seem to me to be arguing about.
<br>
<br>
&gt; and has no other conceivable content belonging to another subjective experience
<br>
<br>
Whoa...I didn't say that.
<br>
<br>
"conceivable content", well if it can be conceived then it's possible for more than one person to conceive it.  That's the basis for memetics.
<br>
<br>
But whether today, trapped in our current world of mono-subjectivity, I can say that subjective content at a high level of abstraction in my reality is the same as in anyone elses is very questionable.  Especially because alot of subjectivity is based on an individuals cognitive history.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; how would you derive such a purely semantic experience from a syntactical 'process' ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
By this I assume you mean how can I get "meaning" from a flow of perceptual steps.  Is that correct?
<br>
<br>
If yes, then it seems to me that you are questioning my acceptance of "emergence" as the basis for this generation of "meaning".
<br>
<br>
I think that the process of generating subjective perceptions is highly epistatic (dependant on the syntax of these perceptual steps).  And that this epistatic pattern varies from person to person (hence the difficulty).  
<br>
<br>
So beyond a certain point, the way my mind stacks the sensory data and the self-reflexive meta models it builds about that creates my subjective experience.  This pattern of stacking is unique to me because I built this as I grew up and received input and feedback from the world.  Our stacking may start out similar out in our sensory organs, but as it moves deeper within "me" (my selfplex") it becomes more unique to me.
<br>
<br>
So like this debate, it's very epistatic.  If I throw in a perspective that's too abstract before we've negotiated a common understanding of its basis it will change the outcome and therefore both our perceptions of what this debate meant.
<br>
<br>
This pattern of stacking is also constantly changing and if you slowly and imperceptibly change my sense organs (as in the growth of cataracts) then my subjective model will adapt and change too.
<br>
<br>
Also, you may have noticed that since the beginning of this thread I have jumped camp and become a dualist.  It is a view of subjective reality as being encapsulated within a sensory based system that converted me.  This is also based on emergence (there's a nice interactive essay on the topic at http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/emergence/).  
<br>
<br>
Patterns only exist because we can integrate a set of sensory data into a single coherent metamodel we call a pattern.  This pattern is not "real" in the sense that it is tangible and can be dropped on your toe.  And often once we explore the mechanics behind the pattern we find it doesn't mechanically behave as it appears (e.g. the squares are really switching on an off and not moving). But to us, because of our ability to integrate sensory data using intelligent feedback loops, it appears very real.
<br>
<br>
I think these intelligent self-reflexive feedback loops are the key.  The evolutionary forces of heredity, variation and selection that enabled life are one good example.  The sensorimotor feedback loop that enabled autonomy is another.  Subjective experience based on sensory data and symbolic replicators is another.  And the quantitative empirical world view (see The Measure of Reality, Crosby, 1997) that has enabled the domination of Western imperialism and the rise of technology based socioculture is yet another.
<br>
<br>
I also think the growth of digital devices is helping us develop and extend our current sensory organs and the way we interact with the world which may create a new and uniquely powerful feedback loop.  One that will again change our whole concept of reality.
<br>

<br>
<br>
It is in fact an inevitable consequence of believing that brains are abstract information processors as you do , to believeing that there has to be some 'extra' element in order to account for the nature of subjective reality and the sematical ( irreducible ) nature of color experiences and emotions. 
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, how can you 'derive' the experience of the emotion of fear ? You can't generate fear with a computer program , e,g with a  program  00101010011010101010. Or hate with a slightly different program 00101101010110101010. How would you  know whether you were meant to be scared or angry ? You'd have to ask the programmer ! Emotions are irreducible and cannot be generated from mathematical objects such as computer programs. The notion is too ridiculous to contemplate, let alone argue about. The experience of colors is another example : how could the manipulation of digits be 'summed' to create 'experinece of red' - they don't even belong to the same ontologies, suggesting that emotions 'emerge' from 'system growth' is a bit like suggesting you can make apples out of oranges.
<br>
<br>
Leaving the only conclusion for strong AI enthusistasts to tak eyour logical step and also become dualists , the one phiolosophy strong AI was meant to avoid ! But I think dualism is unecessary, or at least of no use to us.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hello,
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to barge in on your discussion but I was going to post a question that was very similar and you gentlemen are already well started down this line of thinking!
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was reading Ray's "Spiritual Machines" about 'the schools of thought' around consciousness.  He claimed that one school, the 'mind as a machine', offered consciousness as a process reflecting upon itself but, though we understand that there are physical mechanics of vision and color for example, it still failed to explain 'the essence' of the experience, such as 'redness'.  
<br>
<br>
But he did not explain what this failure was - it seemed to me it the real problem was a play on the words 'objective' and 'subjective'.  Was it simply that he himself was unsatisfied with the physical definition of 'redness' as some people would find the physical definition of 'redness' quite satisfactory?  Or, if I apply the 'process reflecting upon itself' mode to the issue, is dissatisfaction just a self-reflecting process reaching a recursive boundary without achieving its goal?  Would this then make the self-reflective process, or its output, "subjective"?
<br>
<br>
I didn't see this thinking in your thread and am sorry if you have already covered it but I'm interested in your thinking.
<br>
<br>
Cheers, GBTH</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Thank you for your reply.  I didn't get to read your posts previously as they were posted subsequent to my original one.
<br>
<br>
I have read some of the work you referenced and found some insights there as well - esp. Susan Blackmore's meme book.
<br>
<br>
I've thought more about this: Instead of trying to establish draw hard boundaries in our consciousness, could we say that all knowledge is subjective based upon the pure physical mechanics of experience and that objectivity is just a measure or indicator of utility.  Can 'utility' be empirically or consistently measured?  Probably not, but all the same we sometimes find things "more objective" or "less objective".  This would mean then I suppose that there is really no such thing as objectivity.
<br>

In fact a number of those million colors could be called "red."  In different cultures, the spectrum is broken down in ways that are different from how we do it.  When a Chinese person uses the word Huang to refer to shoes, we would call those shoes tan.  But Huang Di is the Yellow Emperor.  People whose name is Brown in English often choose Huang as their family name in Chinese.  So "huang" refers to a broader range of the spectrum than our terms "brown" or "yellow."  That doesn't mean they don't see the same parts of the spectrum the same way we do.  It just means they divide it up differently whe they talk about it.  </p></td>

Why does red appear red ? Why does red appear red and not appear blue ? How does 'experience of blue' emerge from 'evolving systems'  ? How does 1+1 make 'experience of red' ? 
<br>
<br>
The only answer is if those 'evolving systems' have unique physical characteristics, such as brains, that generate mental effects. In which case they are 'systems' charactersied by their semantical contents ( the matter that they are made of  ) and not some abstruse mathematical notion of 'information flow' or 'emegent systemic adaptation'.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
What separates red from the other colors is the frequency at which it is generated.  The rainbow separated light in to a fan of frequencies long before there were meters with which to measure them.  But in the end, red is what the eye and the brain interpret that frequency to be when  compared to previous experiences with patterns of redness to see if it fits into the category we call "red."  
<br>
<br>
Color blind people can't distinguish it from green.  That makes their experience of red much different from mine.  It makes crossing the street at a crosswalk, for example, more dangerous and probably more emotional.  So we can't say everybody's experience of red is the same.  </p></td>

Why is light at X(nm) seen as red and not as blue ( and don't be tautologous and say 'because its at a different wavelength'! ) - of what nature is that interpretive mechanism that , for a slight difference in the wavelngth of a photon produces one subjective experience sematically completely different from the other ?

<br>
<br>
Yep, I'd have to agree with that I think.
<br>
<br>
Since knowledge is held inside our subjective experience and is meaningless without it then it has to be subjective.  It can be structured in a way that makes it repeatable or empirical, but will still remain subjective.
<br>
<br>
I mean if you take away our subjective experience then who's left to perceive this knowledge.
<br>
<br>
The fact that our "objective" models of the world keep getting refined and regularly get completely redefined by some genius with an epiphany shows that it too is simply built upon beliefs.
