<p>Can civil societies absorb the impact of MNT without degenerating 
              almost instantly into Hobbesian micro states, where the principal 
              currency is direct power over other humans, expressed at best as 
              involuntary personal service and, at the worst, sadistic or careless 
              infliction of pain and consequent brutalization of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> in slaves 
              and masters alike? It is a disturbing prospect, more worrying than 
              crazed <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s or sectarian terrorists. Are we, indeed, doomed 
              to this outcome through frailties in our evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, unsuited 
              to such challenges, or perhaps to the rapacity of the current global 
              economy?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A deeper question might be this: even if we assume that rich consumerist 
              and individualist First World cultures like the USA might be prone 
              to such collapse, is that true of all extant societies? Might more 
              rigid or authoritarian societies have an advantage, if their citizens 
              or subjects are too cowed by existing power <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s to dash headlong 
              into lawlessness? Might technologically simpler and poorer societies, 
              possessing fewer goods to begin with and perhaps having fewer rising 
              expectations, rebuff the temptations of MNT? Or might they seize 
              upon such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s eagerly, but distribute them and their cornucopia, 
              if only locally, on models of community or tribe unfamiliar to us 
              in the West?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These seem to me extremely <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issues that will require concentrated 
              and imaginative study by economists, sociologists and anthropologists. 
              Nearly half a century ago, the brilliant <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> writer 
              Damon Knight (1922-2002) published a parable <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> to one possible 
              sheaf of outcomes arising from successful and cheaply available 
              molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological compilation of goods from cheap feedstocks. 
              In his brief <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <i>A For Anything</i><a name="ref1"></a><sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, 
              a radical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>&#8212;the Gismo&#8212;duplicates any <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> within 
              its field, including <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. It needs no feedstock supply, 
              and draws power from batteries, thereby apparently breaching conservation 
              laws. This premise, although invalid given our current understanding 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, fails to dispel the force of Knight' s allegory, since 
              when <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>s eventually turn <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and cheap feed 
              stocks into virtually any desirable good, the more disastrous consequences 
              portrayed by Knight will actually become feasible, unfortunately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Given the exponential proliferation of Gismos that apparently provide 
              everything people need without their working for it, including copies 
              of the Gismo and its batteries, ordered western <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> collapses 
              almost instantly. Water can be produced out of the nothing (the 
              "quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>", perhaps), greening barren lands; plans 
              to create spacecraft that generate their own fuel in flight seem 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> at first to remake the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>. Melodramatically 
              yet plausibly enough, alas, Knight projects an almost instant imposition 
              of martial law and its failure, then, worse yet, general breakdown 
              into lawlessness and acquisition by the brutal and canny of slaves, 
              or "slobs", who can be copied at will when they "wear 
              out". Within half a century, America sinks into a kind of feudalism 
              where nothing, in effect, ever again changes, where innovation seems 
              pointless if not intolerably disruptive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Presciently, Knight realized that this kind of stable stagnation 
              requires more than a simple duplicator, and added the proviso that 
              Gismos can produce "protes" or "arrested prototypes", 
              "a gnarled lump of quasi-matter that could be stored in a pigeonhole, 
              and would keep forever" (27). When an "inhibitor" 
              is activated, the prote provides the information necessary to generate 
              a complete copy of the original. In effect, the Gismo is equivalent 
              to a nanofactory, using storable <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s, although protes have 
              the disadvantage of not being digitized and hence transmissible 
              information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The question <i>A For Anything</i> raises is perhaps one for specialists 
              in cultural change and <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>. My own specialties are discourse 
              theory and science fiction, so all I can do here is suggest diffidently 
              certain possibilities for analytical approaches that are currently 
              unfashionable in the academy and in the business world, but might 
              be of use in probing the unknown. In doing so, I draw upon <a class="thought" href="entries/schema_entry.html">schema</a>ta 
              advanced equally diffidently in my book <i>Theory and its Discontents</i> 
              (1997)<sup><a name="ref2"></a><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>, and 
              a range of overviews of individual and culture conveniently summarized 
              in several books by Ken Wilber, Don Beck, PhD, and others of their 
              school<sup><a name="ref3"></a><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>. Leaving 
              aside the more metaphysical/ "mystical" aspects of his 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, Wilber has usefully condensed the work of some hundred 
              specialists in a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of disciplines to yield a model of cultural 
              phases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To simplify brutally, Wilber and Beck propose that each society 
              tends to segment, both through <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and within a given period, according 
              to a sequence of developmental stages. For shorthand, these are 
              color-coded. The earliest&#8212;though not "simplest", 
              each being as complex as the rest&#8212;is <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">Instinct</a>ive, directed 
              to brute survival (beige), followed by tribal Animism (purple), 
              impulsive Egocentrism (red), disciplined Authority (blue), managerial/ 
              scientific Strategic (orange), communitarian Consensus (green), 
              multicultural <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">Ecology</a> (yellow), and a sort of new age global <a class="thought" href="entries/holism_entry.html">Holism</a> 
              (turquoise), with perhaps several transcendent states beyond this 
              highest level. These overlap to some degree at least with my own 
              suggested cyclical cultural dominants, and several key stages match 
              up with "Three <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">Action</a>" by Mike Treder and Chris 
              Phoenix<a name="ref4"></a><sup><a href="#foot4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treder and Phoenix note three significantly different systems of 
              response for social organization: <i>Guardian</i>, oriented principally 
              around provision of security; <i><a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">Commercial</a></i>, promoting <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              and trade; and <i>Informational</i>, devoted to abundance. It is 
              easy to see that these Dominants (to borrow a term from the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              theory of Roman Jakobson) can be mapped against the most significant 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> of certain periods, cultures, and <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of cultures. 
              In Wilber's terms, Guardian would be blue, and in the USA reflect 
              Republican conservative family values; Commercial orange, representing 
              scientific Enlightenment values; while Informational might perhaps 
              be green, representing postmodern inclusive global or "holistic" 
              values, enthusiasm for <a class="thought" href="entries/open_source_entry.html">open source</a> versus proprietary development 
              of novelty, etc. The interactions between individuals and groups 
              dominated by one mode or another can be troublesome and, indeed, 
              mutually incomprehensible. Green, Wilber warns, tends to "dissolve 
              blue", which can wreak catastrophic damage on prickly red (tribal/gang) 
              cultures or subcultures struggling to shift "upward" toward 
              Enlightenment/ Commercial orange, by invalidating support for the 
              intermediate "conservative" or blue Guardian stage in 
              the interests of a premature holism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My own analysis poses six sequential phases each half a century 
              long and comprising two generations, punctuated by wars. The 300 
              years can be graphed as a sine curve&#8212;an upward semicircle followed 
              by a downward semicircle, each half comprising 150 years. (The full 
              iterated sequence of roughly 50 year phases runs Algorithmic-We-I-It-Theory/Text-<a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">Code</a>-Algorithmic....) 
              I propose no numerology here, attempting rather to draw together 
              a number of separate analyses that seem to find certain recurrences 
              at certain intervals, not all of them compressible into a single 
              algorithm; one influence might enhance another, a third might tend 
              to mute it. What's more, recent human intervention on a <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary 
              scale might be expected to have modified, extended or suppressed 
              such cycles anyway&#8212;although some of the theorists I quote below 
              do carry their schemata forward into the second half of the twentieth 
              century.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A similar model has been suggested in <i>Generations: the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> 
              of America's <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a>, 1584 to 2069</i> by William Strauss and Neil 
              Howe (New York: Morrow, 1991), whose parsed narrative discerns, 
              like Modelski's (below), a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> cycle four generations long, marked 
              by disruptive "secular" and "spiritual events". 
              Cohorts&#8212;individuals born within a given time-frame&#8212;are 
              said to resemble each other in temperament and trajectory more than 
              they do those from earlier or later generations. The four phases, 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, are the Idealists (inner-driven, arrogant, creative), 
              indulged in childhood after a secular event; the Reactives (disruptive 
              in youth, pragmatic in maturity, uncultivated); the Civics (establishment 
              figures); and the Adaptives (guilty conformists, aging into sensitive 
              carers).<sup><a name="ref5"></a><a href="#foot5">5</a></sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three phases or tonalities characterized by Treder and Phoenix 
              match fairly well with the 150 year half cycle I discern between, 
              say, 1850 and 2000, in which the doubled generations are characterized 
              sequentially by the dominants I have dubbed IT (imperialism, Hot 
              Peace, public <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>), THEORY (global war, religiosity, modernism) 
              and CODE (Cold Peace, democracy, postmodernism). In tone, that half 
              cycle begins with what Australian historian and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> J. 
              Penman, Ph.D., calls High Vigor and moderate Stress, through Mid 
              Vigor and High Stress, to Low Vigor today but only Medium Stress.<a name="ref6"></a><sup><a href="#foot6">6</a></sup> 
              These <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s are related to, and perhaps driven by, variations 
              in child-rearing practices and those in turn, historically, on availability 
              of adequate or abundant nutrients, levels of perceived threat and 
              security, etc&#8212;see note 6.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very roughly, we might expect Guardian/IT cultural phases to attempt 
              to impose strong centralized and hierarchical command over the ownership 
              of nanofactories and any distribution of their socially disruptive 
              cheap goods. Commercial/THEORY phases might use state power as well 
              as conglomerate capital power to restrict or co-opt MNT. Informational/CODE 
              phases will be likely to embrace MNT and attempt to spread its benefits 
              widely, perhaps to the whole world, and to resist conservative "moral 
              values" restraints, <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> ownership, and <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a>s. It 
              is obvious, despite the natural affiliation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-savvy members 
              of the Code or green generations, that very powerful forces will 
              be strongly motivated to restrict MNT for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s of private gain 
              and public security, even in those societies falling increasingly 
              under this dominant in the last 50 years</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The problem foreshadowed by Knight's novel is that resistance to 
              the free development and distribution of MNT might elicit regression 
              to earlier dominants. In Wilber's terms these are beige (instinctual/subservience 
              to parents), purple (magical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>) and red (egocentric), which 
              map moderately well with the earlier (and subsequent) 150 year semi-cycle 
              I have proposed, summarized briefly as ALGORITHMIC (global conflict, 
              classicism, aristocracy), WE (feudal disorder, formal <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> at 
              nadir, superstition at zenith), and finally I (romanticism, beginning 
              with successful revolutions and perhaps global war and culminating 
              in thwarted revolutions). Historically, in the West, these three 
              dominants held sway between 1700 and 1850, continuing on into the 
              three phases previously described. On this model, which is consistent 
              with classic long cycle analyses by G. Modelski<sup><a name="ref7"></a><a href="#foot7">7</a></sup> 
              and others, we are arguably heading right now into a new algorithmic 
              or phatic phase, with its attendant risks of banality, degeneration 
              towards superstition, significant conflict (and perhaps the unexpected 
              "War on Terror"&#8212;and <i>by</i> culturally motivated 
              terrorists and hegemonists&#8212;is an index of this). Of course, 
              such 300-year cycles&#8212;which I trace back through at least three 
              iterations, and probably much farther&#8212;would presumably be interrupted 
              forever by a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>, especially one in which drastic <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> 
              becomes possible, thereby upsetting the already muddled traditional 
              replacement of generations raised under consecutively different 
              conditions. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> is clearly one of the driving forces 
              thrusting advanced technological cultures toward just such a Singularity. 
              One question, therefore, is whether Wilber's orange and green phases 
              or waves can be sustained in their dominant roles at a time when 
              external and internal factors are arguably impelling Western cultures, 
              as well as their foes, toward what one might regard as more primitive 
              dominants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, this kind of analysis might lend itself usefully to the 
              study of contemporary cultures other than the Western. Should they 
              all be regarded, however different they remain, as <i>in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a></i> 
              synchronized with the productive and informational drivers of the 
              global economy? One suggestion I hesitantly made in my preliminary 
              study is that societies throughout the world have been <i>traditionally</i> 
              tied, far more than we might imagine, to a kind of global clock 
              driven by variable insolation, and the impact of available solar 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> upon climate and hence food supply. Again, even if this has 
              been the case, it might no longer be so in an epoch where human-induced 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> is skewing traditional large-scale solar-modulated 
              weather <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, and in which global scientific production and 
              transport of food and raw materials to a large extent obviates reliance 
              upon local climatic conditions.<sup><a name="ref8"></a><a href="#foot8">8</a></sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In any <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, it seems arguable that an analysis of cultural dominants 
              of this kind, and their differential impact, might provide some 
              general guidance in our expectations of the near-future impact of 
              any truly radical and disruptive <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> such as MNT.</p>

<p><a name="foot5"></a><a href="#ref5">5.</a> What drives this recurrence, 
              in Strauss and Howe's view, is a cycle of nurturant practice. Underprotection 
              in childhood creates a tendency in the adults so formed to pay more 
              attention to their own children, so the next generation shows increasing 
              nurturance. The third step is a generation smothered by overprotection, 
              and the reaction to such stifling is a fourth phase of decreasing 
              nurturance, which in turn leads back to the start of the cycle.</p>

<p>It is interesting that the <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion suggested by Strauss 
              and Howe resembles a compressed version of my own model and Wilber's, 
              with their four-step periodicity folded into every pair of consecutive 
              Dominant regimes in mine. Inner-driven Idealists correspond in character 
              with my "I" generations, Reactives with "IT" 
              empiricism, Civics with "THEORY/TEXT" governance, and 
              Adaptives with "PHATIC/ALGORITHMIC" conformity. Two stages 
              are elided: "CODE", following "THEORY", and 
              "WE", following "PHATIC", but the two models 
              operate at different scales. Neither is there a gross discord between 
              the order of the two sequences. No doubt this is connected with 
              the individual <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-stage structure that also underlies each model: 
              Youth (which conflates "WE" and "I" stages), 
              Rising Adults ("IT"), Midlife Adults ("THEORY/TEXT" 
              plus the shift to "CODE"), Elders (the transition from 
              "CODE" to "PHATIC" or "RULE").</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To sketch briefly the broad basis of Penman's mechanism, operating 
              on cultures via typical patterns for discipline of their infants: 
              Societies using early control tend to develop a politics based on 
              group loyalty; in a time-frame of low Restraint they produce feudalism, 
              and during high Restraint, they produce stable city states and nation 
              states. Their populations are open to change, and have elaborate 
              economic skills. By contrast, societies lacking early control favor 
              a politics based on personal, face-to-face authority; low Restraint 
              stretches of the cycle are marked by unstable control over regions 
              with shifting borders, while during high Restraint regimes they 
              build large imperial dominions. Their populations are tradition-bound, 
              and less skilled (Penman, p. 184).</p>

              Cycles in World Politics</i>, Seattle: University of Washington 
              Press, 1987.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Modelski is correct, since 1494 the world system, parameterized 
              in versions of the four Parsonian variables (economy, polity, societal 
              community, and pattern maintenance or <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>/information apparatuses), 
              has passed through five "long cycles", each with four 
              generational phases. The cycles run to a little more than a century 
              each, and climax in devastating contests for world leadership. These 
              global conflicts last between 23 and 31 years, with the same average 
              as his cycle generation, 27 years. The turn of the millennium marked 
              the exhausted stage of an American century, and, if no better and 
              more humane means is devised for adjudicating leadership, the world 
              probably would be doomed to a new global war in perhaps 2030 (but 
              not until then).</p>

<p><a name="foot8"></a><a href="#ref8">8.</a> A somewhat different 
              but arguably overlapping analysis was developed by Raymond H. Wheeler, 
              a former professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> at the University of Kansas and 
              president of the Kansas Academy of Sciences, who constructed his 
              own grand theory of cultural recurrence. Around the middle of the 
              20<sup>th</sup> century, Wheeler orchestrated a massive <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> project, drawing 
              on up to two hundred co-workers, to reduce all of recorded history 
              to coherent summary form. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> from 2500 years of records 
              were tabulated, he discerned a number of recurrent patterns world-wide. 
              The most notable was a roughly 100-year climatic cycle, varying 
              between 70 and 120 years, which seemed to fall into four predictable 
              phases. From this periodicity, and drawing on then-prevalent doctrines 
              of cultural and ethnic character, he theorized a regular swing of 
              mass psychological emphasis between "classical" or "centralist" 
              and "romantic" or "individualist" styles of 
              community and culture, summarized in Ellsworth Huntington, <i>Mainsprings 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">Civilization</a></i>, [1945] 1959, New York: Mentor, 515-7. (Huntington 
              was an explorer and Yale professor of geography and climatology 
              whose books ranged from <i>Civilization and Climate</i> (1915) to 
              his magnum opus, <i>Mainsprings of Civilization</i>, published two 
              years before his <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. His thesis of strong climatic <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a> 
              strikes us today as crankily ethnocentric at best, for he sought 
              to discover why "vigorous" peoples like <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y Euro-Americans 
              were so much more successful than the "indolent", "feminized" 
              races nearer the equator or otherwise trapped and stultified by 
              debilitating circumstances. In the era of the Asian Tigers on the 
              Pacific Rim, not to mention the historic defeat of American <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> 
              efforts by tropical Vietnamese and the current imbroglio in Iraq, 
              this claim seems not just racist but ludicrous. We should not be 
              entirely distracted, however, by our legitimate distaste for colonial 
              premises and rhetoric. Huntington's comparative ethnography remains 
              a rich trove of data, usefully categorized, on historical and environmental 
              flows in the fortunes of nations.)<br>
</p>
<p>Obviously these climate-driven distinctions cannot be found literally 
              everywhere simultaneously, because a global shift like the El Ni&#241;o 
              vacillation will bring unusually abundant rain to one region while 
              filching it from another. Still, events like the Maunder Minimum 
              suggest that at least some secular climatic variations on the order 
              of a century can be due to changes in the sun's internal clock. 
              It is feasible that more subtle variations depend on more regular 
              solar pacemakers, such as the deep processes that also cause the 
              sunspot cycle and perhaps (even in the absence of human intervention) 
              modulate global warming and cooling.<br>
</p>
<p>Wheeler and his team found their data was usefully schematized 
              by a four-fold sequence: Warm-Wet, Warm-Dry, Cold-Wet, and Cold-Dry. 
              Each contributed to a certain characteristic mode of collective 
              behavior, so that "similar events have occurred throughout 
              history during the same phases of the 100-year climate cycle" 
              (Dewey and Mandino, <i>Cycles</i>, 1971, New York: Manor Books, 
              138). Adapting this model in brutally schematic form, and projecting 
              20 years (without taking account of drastic global climate change), 
              we might map the 20<sup>th</sup> century thus (138-9):</p>
