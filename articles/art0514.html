<div class="TeaserText">The movie Simone presents an "unrealistic notion of how technology is introduced to the world," says Ray  Kurzweil in this review. He examines this portrayal from the perspective of his own transformation at the TED conference into Ramona, the state of the art for real-time virtual personality transformation two years ago.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p> Andrew Niccol's "Simone" tells the tale of a desperate 
              director, Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino), who saves his career by creating 
              (and transforming himself into) his virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego, "Simone," 
              who has "the voice of the young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia 
              Loren, the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel, and the 
              grace of Grace Kelly," as his ex-wife Elaine Christian (Catherine 
              Keener) describes her.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614003526im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/simone_7057.jpg" width="400"></p>
<p>As someone who has actually had Viktor Taransky's <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of 
              transforming himself into his virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego (a virtual 
              personality named <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> whom I describe more below), I will say 
              that Simone would not be my choice for a <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego. I can't 
              comment on Simone's body, since we don't get to see much of it, 
              but Elaine's generous description is provided simply to establish 
              the movie's conceit. Although the audience (in the movie) has little 
              difficulty accepting it, she has none of these purported qualities. 
            </p>
<p>Simone is played by model Rachel Roberts, who, interestingly, is 
              not credited. There is a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of a missed connection here, as models 
              are trained to provide attractive mannequins rather than conveying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al ideas, so relatively few models successfully cross over 
              into acting. The idea here is that Simone is intended to be perfection 
              itself, but her only perfection is her complete lack of any real 
              personality and <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>.</p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="5" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614003526im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/ramona-headshot2.jpg">To 
              digress for a moment on my own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in this vein, my idea 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego needed to have more edge and color. So when 
              my team at KurzweilAI.net and I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out two years ago to create 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, we wanted to create a virtual yet photorealistic person 
              with some specificity. I wrote a detailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614003526/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0093.html?m=9" target="_top">biography</a> 
              that although quite different on a superficial level from my own 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> story resonated with themes in my own <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. For <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s face 
              and body, we started with a real woman (Amy Bluestein, now a medical 
              student) and changed her appearance to be closer to that of Holly 
              McNarland, a little known Canadian rock singer who conveyed some 
              of the attitude I was striving for. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, however, ended up as 
              her own woman. </p>
<p>We went on to create an elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that demonstrated 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> that Viktor illustrates in the movie Simone. As I moved 
              the parts of my body, using a <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>-capture <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> moved 
              in exactly the same way in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. My voice was transformed into 
              her voice, and her lips moved with my lips. I had a singing coach 
              to llearn to sing like a woman, a dancing coach to dance like a 
              woman, and picked up tips from my teenage daughter on the attitude 
              and style appropriate for a 25 year old <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> rock singer from 
              New Orleans. My daughter also contributed to the choreography and 
              was herself transformed into a photorealistic <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> back-up dancer. 
            </p>

<p>We presented this live real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> transformation 
              performance on February 22, 2001 at the famed TED (<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">Entertainment</a> 
              and Design) conference, which attracts over a thousand attendees 
              from the Hollywood and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> communities each year in Monterey. 
              You can see a video of this presentation, read <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>'s biography, 
              and other background <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614003526/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?m=9">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?m=9</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> was enlightening for me and my colleagues in many 
              ways. Given the state of today's <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it was a daunting and 
              exhaustive effort to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up the technologies to accomplish this 
              transformation. Once <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up, however, the results were quite transforming. 
              To change oneself into someone else, which I've always maintained, 
              is one of the more compelling features of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, provides 
              an expanded perspective on the image of who we are. We tend to become 
              very identified with our current physical image, so the idea that 
              it is actually possible to convincingly become someone else is rather 
              liberating. </p>
<p>This was not a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of gender confusion on my part, but rather 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of the idea that we really do have other personalities 
              within us that we can and should express if given the opportunity. 
              There will be, of course, many practical applications of this idea 
              once perfected, including game playing, <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> (e.g., become 
              a virtual Ben Franklin in a virtual Congressional Congress), personal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al development, and exploring new ways to relate to one another. 
            </p>
<h3>The state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> in synthespians</h3>
<p>To return to Simone, the movie was more enjoyable than I had expected. 
              From the publicity, I was dismayed at the apparent decision to use 
              the glamorous but vapid image of a model to portray a man's ideal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter ego. But in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of this comedy, the audience 
              is told to just accept the fact that the world has gone crazy for 
              this new <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>. Indeed we are told to accept a lot of things that 
              strain credulity, but the film nonetheless achieves some gentle 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/humor_entry.html">humor</a>. </p>
<p>Mostly this is due to Al Pacino's vintage performance. Although 
              playing his usual intense, angst-ridden, passionate, and obsessive 
              persona, the performance is sufficiently nuanced to carry us along. 
              Mercifully, Viktor is less abrasive than, say, Pacino's Lieutenant 
              Colonel Frank Slade in the 1992 film Scent of a Woman. The movie 
              Simone never takes itself too seriously, so we are willing to overlook 
              the many levels at which the movie fails to track.</p>
<p>The most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant of these for me is an unrealistic notion of 
              how <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is introduced to the world. Simone becomes a world 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>, yet has the obvious and bizarre requirement of never appearing 
              in public or with another person. </p>
<p>Despite this, no one ever suspects that Simone is a synthespian 
              (this term, meaning "virtual actor or actress" was coined 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/kleiser_entry.html">Jeff Kleiser</a> and Diana Walczak of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614003526/http://www.kwcc.com/" target="_blank">Kleiser 
              Walczak</a>, who created the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models for our <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> project), 
              despite the fact that the world portrayed in Simone is well aware 
              of synthespians. (Taransky discusses the notion with the crazed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> Hank Aleno, portrayed by Elias Koteas, who has created 
              Simone's <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.) Presumably the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that no one questions 
              whether Simone might be a synthespian is because Simone is so utterly 
              convincing as a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. </p>
<p>But this is never how such <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> evolves. You can see the 
              state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> for real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> virtual personality transformation 
              as of two years ago by looking at the <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> videos I referenced 
              above. <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably photorealistic but she would never get 
              away with what Simone gets away with. For the state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> in 
              non-real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> synthespian <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, take a look at <a class="thought" href="entries/sony_entry.html">Sony</a>'s Final 
              Fantasy. These virtual actors are impressive but again not completely 
              convincing. </p>
<p>Over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, these and other forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> will become 
              more and more realistic, but only ever so gradually. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              the "perfection" presumably represented by Simone is feasible, 
              the public will be very familiar with the idea of a virtual actress. 
              Technologies such as these never burst on the scene fully formed 
              with no imperfections as is displayed in this film. </p>
<p>We see this problem in lots of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>-futurism movies. In "A.I.," 
              for example, one enterprising head of a <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development 
              department just comes up with the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> idea of adding "emotion" 
              to their line of <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a>s, and their generation 1.0 product is essentially 
              perfect. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that we're already <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ing in a primitive 
              way with <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, and the mastery 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> "EQ" will evolve only very gradually. </p>
<h3>Virtual VR</h3>
<p>Simone is in fact only a virtual virtual personality (or "fake 
              fake," as director Andrew Niccol puts it). The movie credits 
              fail to credit Rachel Roberts, saying that Simone is played by "herself." 
              New Line Cinema (a division of Warner Brothers) may think this is 
              all in good fun, but I do know that many people are honestly confused 
              by the supposed <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> behind Simone. The truth is that there 
              is no <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> behind Simone. This is a movie about a synthespian 
              but no synthespian <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was used to make the movie. In the 
              movie, Elaine chides Viktor that he has not budgeted anything for 
              Simone's wardrobe, hairdressing, or makeup ("she does her own" 
              is Viktor's response). </p>
<p>In the same <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a>, I would chide Simone's producers for apparently 
              providing little budget for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics. Anyone expecting 
              a state-of-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> demonstration will be disappointed. All we have 
              is the very real Rachel Roberts with a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of pixelation during 
              a TV remote, some defocusing of her mouth, a few alterations to 
              her eyes to give them an ethereal look, alterations to her voice, 
              including splicing together the voices of multiple actresses, and 
              a few other simple techniques. </p>
<p>We see a few tricks with Viktor applying such accoutrements as 
              hair and tears, but these represent fairly <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>ary graphics manipulations. 
              With regard to the ensuing controversy about leaving out Rachel 
              Roberts' credit, one suspects that New Line Cinema welcomes the 
              controversy, as any publicity is good publicity. </p>
<p> There are many other issues with the technical premise here. From 
              my own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, it took a team of 20 people to pull off our live 
              presentation of <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, yet Viktor manages to pull off a live holographic 
              presentation of Simone before 100,000 fans and a worldwide audience 
              with absolutely no staff at all. However, in the comedic <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> 
              of the film, we're willing to abandon all disbelief. </p>
<p> Andrew Niccol's screenplay does present some provocative questions 
              for us to ponder. In the course of Viktor's dialogues with his <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> 
              alter ego, he provides Simone with such pithy insights as "you're 
              more authentic than the people who worship you," "the 
              scales have tipped in favor of the fake," and "our ability 
              to manufacture fraud exceeds our ability to detect it." He 
              has Simone say "I am the <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of the real." The movie 
              does not dwell on these concerns, however, and I agree with Ty Burr, 
              whose <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614003526/http://www.boston.com/dailynews/235/economy/_Simone_s_leading_lady_may_be_:.shtml" target="_blank">review</a> 
              in the Boston Globe describes these <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s as mere "bullets 
              on a PowerPoint presentation."</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>     Ray's review is interesting--but I think he gets lost in worrying over whether the technology is realistic.  That Simone is a computer simulation is just a plot device.  The filmmaker is doing a satirical observation on the relationship between the real and the wished-for in our media-drenched popular culture.
<br>
     IMHO, in the movie, the people who are fooled by Simone are fooled because they want to be fooled.  The tabloid reporters who are snooping around, trying to find out about her, learn almost enough to figure out the truth, but they don't want to go there...they, like the others, have invested too much of themselves into the idea of Simone.  When Victor is charged with murdering her, the police can't possibly comprehend that she was a fake.  Look at all the magazine covers!  If she's in People Magazine, isn't she a real person?
<br>
     In a sense, Simone is like many of the celebrities that people obsess over every day.  Popular singers, actors, athletes, public officials...many of them work behind a public persona which is completely invented, and might as well be a computer simulation.   When Nicole Simpson was murdered and O.J. Simpson was arrested, a woman in my office said she couldn't believe that Simpson could have been a murderer, because he seemed to be such a "nice guy."  But that persona was not necessarily any more real than Simone.  But she had come to believe that she knew Simpson, simply because he was familiar to her.
<br>
     Some psychologists say that celebrities have taken the place of gods and goddesses in the lives of many.  They are the focus of wish fulfillment and fantasy.  Although "Simone", as a satire, is obviously over the top, the basic premise, that a personality could be simulated and then sold to the public, doesn't seem that farfetched to me. 
<br>
   At the end of the movie, Simone is interviewed on television, and she talks about going into politics.  Could there be a virtual politician?  In George Orwell's 1949 novel "1984", the Party has apparently created the person of Big Brother to focus the people of Oceania's love and hate where the Party wants it focused.  A virtual leader might be more attractive to some people--no messy private life to get in the way, for instance.  Not that I expect it to come to that--but, how close are the public images of our political leaders to their real, flesh-and-blood selves, anyway?  And when real life intrudes, look how people try to explain it away, to hold on to the image.
<br>
     I think "Simone" is a witty little meditation on celebrity's place in our culture.

A fictional movie doesn't have to have ANY basis on reality, that is the reason they call it fiction.
