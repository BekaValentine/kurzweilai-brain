<div class="TeaserText">Technology based on intentional, open-source biology is on its way, whether we like it or not. Distributed biological manufacturing is the future of the global economy and will occur as inexpensive, quality DNA sequencing and synthesis equipment becomes available to anyone. In 2050, garage biology hacking will be well under way. Fear of potential hazards should be met with increased research and education, rather than closing the door on the profound positive impacts that distributed biological technology will have on human health, human impacts on the environment, and increasing standards of living around the world.

<p>In 50 years, you may be reading IEEE Spectrum on a leaf. The page 
              will not actually look like a leaf, but it will be grown like a 
              leaf. It will be designed for its function, and it will be alive. 
              The leaf will be the product of intentional <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> design and 
              manufacturing. </p>
<p>Rather than being constantly green, the cells on its surface will 
              contain pigments controlled by the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of something akin to a 
              nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Like the skin of a cuttlefish, the cells will turn 
              color to form words and images as directed by a connection to the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> of the day. Given the speed with which the cuttlefish changes 
              its pigment, these pages may not change fast enough to display moving 
              images, but they will be fine for the written word. Each page will 
              be slightly thicker than the paper Spectrum is now printed on, making 
              room for control <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s (the nervous system) and circulation of 
              nutrients. When a page ages, or is damaged, it will be easily recycled. 
              It will be fueled by sugar and <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. </p>
<p>Many of the <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s produced in 50 years and used in daily living 
              will have a similar appearance and a similar origin. The consequences 
              of mature biological design and manufacturing will be widespread, 
              and will affect all aspects of the economy, including <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and 
              resource usage, <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>, and labor. Today, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> paper 
              and similar display technologies are just around the corner, but 
              in the long run they will not be able to compete with the products 
              of inexpensive, distributed biological manufacturing. </p>
<p>Growing <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered leaves for display <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s may seem a complex 
              biological engineering feat, but foundations for the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              are already being laid. Structurally simple replacement <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tissues 
              are currently being grown in the laboratory on frameworks of suture 
              material. Projects to grow functional human heart tissue, and eventually 
              a whole heart, are under way, with a timeline for completion of 
              10 years. </p>
<h2><b>Genomic parts list</b> </h2>
<p>Within those 10 years, the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s of many <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s will be sequenced, 
              providing a parts list for the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s forming the structural and 
              control elements in those organisms. Biologists, engineers, and 
              physicists are already collaborating on models that will help us 
              understand how those parts work and fit together. The goal for these 
              models is quantitative prediction of the behavior of biological 
              systems, which will have profound implications for the understanding 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and for improving human health. </p>
<p>Beyond initial biomedical consequences, models that can be used 
              to predict the effects of perturbations to existing biological systems 
              will become de facto design tools, providing an infrastructure for 
              creating new technologies based on biology. When we can successfully 
              predict the behavior of designed biological systems, then an intentional 
              biology will exist. With an explicit engineering <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>, intentional 
              biology is the opposite of the current, very nearly random applications 
              of biology as technology. </p>
<p>For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the present debate over genetically modified foods 
              is more indicative of the poorly planned use of an immature technology 
              than a failure of the technology itself. At present we simply can't 
              predict the effects of tinkering with a system as complex as crops 
              and their pests. But as with the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion of every other human 
              technology, from fire, to bridges, to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, biological engineering 
              will improve with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Quantitative models for simple systems like 
              viral infections of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> and yeast signal transduction pathways 
              are already being tested. <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s developed in those 
              efforts will soon be applied to higher plants and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. It is 
              a short step from successful prediction to design and the beginning 
              of industrial applications. </p>
<p>Yet even before the advent of true biological design, more general 
              lessons from biology are already transforming our economy. The potential 
              impact on industrial practices of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> from biology is enormous 
              and is explored in the book Natural <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">Capitalism</a>, by Paul Hawken and 
              Amory and L. Hunter Lovins (Little, Brown, London, 1999). </p>
<p>The authors point out that structuring business practices along 
              biological lines can significantly improve the bottom line. The 
              human circulatory system, for instance, is optimized to minimize 
              the work required to pump blood throughout the body. The majority 
              of industrial pumping systems, however, are optimized to minimize 
              the cost of the pipes during construction. This means smaller pipes 
              are used, requiring large pumps that use vastly more energy than 
              necessary. </p>
<p>Similarly, in the human pumping system, the heart has to work too 
              hard when arteriosclerosis reduces the diameter of blood vessels. 
              These vessels then require maintenance in the form of an angioplasty. 
              Industrial pumping systems are designed with built-in arteriolosclerosis, 
              and fixing them requires rebuilding from the ground up. Paying careful 
              attention to several hundred million years of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>'s trial-and-error 
              design <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> will save human industry considerable energy and 
              resources. </p>
<h2><b>A living industrial infrastructure</b> </h2>
<p>Borrowing a design aesthetic for industrial function from nature 
              is just the beginning. The living world will also become part of 
              our industrial infrastructure. Nature has already discovered how 
              to fabricate materials and to finesse <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> in ways that are 
              the envy of human engineers and chemists. Many companies, both established 
              and startup, are now focusing on harvesting enzymes from organisms 
              in the environment for use in industrial processes. </p>
<p>Popular examples of high-strength materials fabricated by biology 
              at low temperature, pressure, and energy cost are spider silk and 
              abalone shell. Yet increased resource efficiency and biomaterials 
              are only the first steps in a revolution in manufacturing. Beyond 
              using biology as a model for the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> and function of industrial 
              production, the year 2050 will see humans using biology as the means 
              of production itself. </p>
<p>Whereas most manufacturing today is highly centralized and materials 
              are transported long distances throughout the assembly process, 
              in the year 2050 human industry will use distributed and renewable 
              manufacturing based upon biology. Renewable manufacturing means 
              that biology will be used to produce many of the physical things 
              we use every day. </p>
<p>In early <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation, the organism of choice is likely to be 
              yeast or a bacterium. The physical infrastructure for this type 
              of manufacturing is inherently flexible: it is essentially the vats, 
              pumps, and fluid-handling <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> found in any brewery. Production 
              runs for different products would involve seeding a vat with a yeast 
              strain containing the appropriate genetic instructions and then 
              providing raw materials. </p>
<p>To be sure, there will always be applications and environments 
              in which biological fabrication is not the best option, and it is 
              not clear how complex the fabrication task can be, but biology is 
              capable of fabrication feats impossible for any current or envisioned 
              human technology to emulate. In some ways, this scheme sounds a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> like Eric Drexler's <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, except that 
              we already have functional <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>&#8212;it's called biology. 
            </p>
<p>The transformation to an economy based on biological manufacturing 
              will occur as technical manipulations become easier with practice 
              and through a proliferation of workers with the appropriate skills. 
              Biological engineering will proceed from profession, to vocation, 
              to avocation, because the availability of inexpensive, quality <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> 
              sequencing and <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> equipment will allow participation by anyone 
              who wants to learn the details. In 2050, following the fine tradition 
              of hacking automobiles and computers, garage biology hacking will 
              be well under way. </p>
<p>Considerable <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is already available on how to manipulate 
              and analyze DNA in the kitchen. A recent Scientific American Amateur 
              Scientist column provided instructions for amplifying DNA through 
              the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and a previous column dealt 
              with analyzing DNA samples on homemade electrophoresis equipment. 
              The discussion was immediately picked up in a <a class="thought" href="entries/slashdot_entry.html">slashdot</a>.org thread 
              where participants provided tips for improving the yield of the 
              PCR process. </p>
<p>More detailed, technical information can be found in any university 
              biology library in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, which 
              contains instructions on how to perform virtually every task needed 
              in modern molecular biology. This printed compendium has recently 
              joined the myriad resources maintained on-line by universities and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> agencies, thereby becoming all the more <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible. Open-source 
              biology is already becoming a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. </p>
<p>As the "coding" infrastructure for understanding, <a class="thought" href="entries/troubleshoot_entry.html">troubleshoot</a>ing, 
              and, ultimately, designing biology develops, DNA sequencers and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>s will become less expensive, faster, and ever simpler 
              to use. These critical technologies will first move from academic 
              labs and large <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> companies to small businesses, and 
              eventually to the home garage and kitchen. Many standard laboratory 
              techniques that once required a doctorate's worth of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and 
              experience to execute correctly are now used by undergraduates in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> setting with kits containing color-coded bottles of reagents. 
              The recipes are easy to follow. </p>
<p>This change in technology represents a democratization of sorts, 
              and it illustrates the likely changes in labor structure that will 
              accompany the blossoming of biological technology. </p>
<h2><b>Distributed biological manufacturing</b> </h2>
<p>The course of labor in biological technology can be charted by 
              looking at the experience of the computer and Internet industries. 
              Many startup companies in <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> have become contract-engineering 
              efforts, funded by <a class="thought" href="entries/venture_capital_entry.html">venture capital</a>, where workers sign on expecting 
              the company will be sold within a few years, whereupon they will 
              find a new assignment. The leading edge of the biological technology 
              revolution could soon look the same. However, unlike today's integrated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, where manufacturing infrastructure costs have now reached 
              upward of US $1 billion per facility, the infrastructure costs for 
              renewable biological manufacturing will continue to decline. <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, 
              and all the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>arily developed technology it utilizes, operates 
              at essentially room temperature, fueled by sugars. Renewable, biological 
              manufacturing will take place anywhere someone wants to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a 
              vat or plant a seed. </p>
<p>Distributed biological manufacturing will be all the more flexible 
              because the commodity in biotechnology is today becoming information, 
              rather than things. While it is still often necessary to exchange 
              samples through the mail, the <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> industry has already begun 
              to derive income from solely selling information about gene <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>, 
              or which genes are turned on in a particular population of cells. 
            </p>
<p>In a few decades it will be the genomic sequence that is sent between 
              labs, there to be re-synthesized and expressed as needed. It is 
              already possible to synthesize sufficient DNA to build a bacterial 
              genome from scratch in a few weeks using chemical means. Over the 
              coming decades, that time will be reduced to days, and then to hours, 
              eventually via the development of directed, template-free, enzymatic 
              synthesis&amp;#8212a DNA "synthase." </p>
<p>It is possible that the evolution of open-source biology will be 
              delayed by retrenchment on the part of corporations trying to protect 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>. However, the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> model of biology as a 
              technological <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> of any corporation can be found by simply 
              looking at the way life currently makes use of biological technology. 
              Only very rarely is it the case that advantage is conferred on an 
              organism via a biochemically unique enzyme or pathway. </p>
<p>The toolbox of biochemistry, the parts list&#8212;"the <a class="thought" href="entries/kernel_entry.html">kernel</a>," 
              to stretch the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>&#8212;is shared by all organisms 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. In general, organisms differ from one another because 
              of their <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of gene expression or because of relatively subtle 
              perturbations to protein structures common to all forms of terrestrial 
              life. That is, innovation in the natural world in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> has 
              always followed the idea of a service and flow economy. If the environment 
              is static, only when an organism figures out how to use the old 
              toolbox to provide itself, or another organism, with a new service 
              is advantage conferred. </p>
<p>The analogy to future industrial applications of biology is clear: 
              When molecular biologists figure out the kernel of biology, innovation 
              by humans will consist of tweaking the parts to provide new services. 
              Because of the sheer amount of information, it is unlikely that 
              a single <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> could maintain a monopoly on the kernel. 
              Eventually, as design tasks increase in <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> and sophistication, 
              corporations will have to share techniques and this information 
              will inevitably spread widely, reaching all levels of technical 
              ability&#8212;the currency of the day will be innovation and design. 
              As with every other technology developed by humans, biological technology 
              will be broadly disseminated. </p>
<h2><b>Bypassing conventional infrastructure</b> </h2>
<p>As open-source biological manufacturing spreads, it will be adopted 
              quickly in less developed economies to bypass the first world's 
              investment in industrial infrastructure. Given the stressed state 
              of natural resources throughout much of the developing world, it 
              will not be possible for many of those countries to attain first-world 
              standards of living with industrial infrastructure as wasteful as 
              that of the United States. The developing world simply cannot afford 
              industrial and energy inefficiency. </p>
<p>A short cut is to follow the example of the growing <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>-only 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s infrastructure in Africa and to skip building systems 
              to transport power and goods. It is already clear that distributed 
              power generation will soon become more efficient than are centralized 
              systems. Distributed manufacturing based upon local resources will 
              save transportation costs, simplify customization, require less 
              infrastructure investment, and, as a result, will likely cost less 
              than centralized manufacturing. </p>
<p>Distributed biological manufacturing is the future of the global 
              economy. With design and fabrication power spread throughout the 
              world to the extent suggested here, it is necessary to consider 
              possible dangers. The simple answer is that those dangers are real 
              and considerable. </p>
<p>This technology enables the creation of new organisms potentially 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>ic to humans, or to animals and plants upon which we rely. 
              It is already clear that the social and biological consequences 
              of extending human life span and human germline engineering will 
              consume considerable public debate time over the next few decades. 
              Moreover, the underlying infrastructure and methods are already 
              so widespread that no one country will be able to manipulate the 
              development of biological technology by controlling the research 
              within its borders. </p>
<p>But fear of potential hazards should be met with increased research 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, rather than closing the door on the profound positive 
              impacts that distributed biological technology will have on human 
              health, human impacts on the environment, and increasing standards 
              of living around the world. </p>
<p>Technology based on intentional, open-source biology is on its 
              way, whether we like it or not, and the opportunity it represents 
              will just begin to emerge in the next 50 years. </p>
