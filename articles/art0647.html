                The cryptic reference to "other cosmic phenomena" would appear

<p> </p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> The notion that we inhabit a universe whose laws and physical 
              constants are fine-tuned in such a way as to make it hospitable 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based life is an old idea (Gardner, 2003). The so-called 
              "anthropic" principle comes in at least four principal versions 
              (Barrow and Tipler, 1988) that represent fundamentally different 
              ontological perspectives. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the "weak anthropic principle" 
              is merely a tautological statement that since we happen to inhabit 
              this particular cosmos it must perforce by life-friendly or else 
              we would not be here to observe it. As Vilenkin put it recently 
              (Vilenkin, 2004), "the &#8216;anthropic' principle, as stated above, 
              hardly deserves to be called a principle: it is trivially true." 
              By contrast, the "participatory anthropic principle" articulated 
              by Wheeler and dubbed "it from <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>" (Wheeler, 1996) is a radical 
              extrapolation from the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics 
              and a profoundly counterintuitive assertion that the very act of 
              observing the universe summons it into existence.</p>
<p>All anthropic cosmological interpretations share a common theme: 
              a recognition that key constants of physics (as well as other physical 
              aspects of our cosmos such as its dimensionality) appear to exhibit 
              a mysterious fine-tuning that optimizes their collective bio-friendliness. 
              Rees noted (Rees, 2000) that virtually every aspect of the evolution 
              of the universe&#8212;from the birth of galaxies to the origin of 
              life on Earth&#8212;is sensitively dependent on the precise values 
              of seemingly arbitrary constants of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> like the strength of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of extended spatial dimensions in our universe 
              (three of the ten posited by M-theory), and the initial expansion 
              speed of the cosmos following the Big Bang. If any of these physical 
              constants had been even slightly different, life as we know it would 
              have been impossible:</p>
<blockquote> The [cosmological] picture that emerges&#8212;a map in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> as well as in space&#8212;is not what most of us expected. It 
              offers a new perspective on a how a single "genesis <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>" created 
              billions of galaxies, <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s, stars and planets, and how atoms 
              have been assembled&#8212;here on Earth, and perhaps on other worlds&#8212;into 
              living beings intricate enough to ponder their origins. There are 
              deep connections between stars and atoms, between the cosmos and 
              the microworld.... Our emergence and survival depend on very special 
              "tuning" of the cosmos&#8212;a cosmos that may be even vaster than 
              the universe that we can actually see.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> As stated recently by Smolin (Smolin, 2004), the challenge is 
              to provide a genuinely scientific explanation for what he terms 
              the "anthropic observation":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>The anthropic observation:</b> <i>Our universe is much more 
                complex than most universes with the same laws but different values 
                of the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s of those laws. In particular, it has a complex 
                astrophysics, including galaxies and long lived stars, and a complex 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a>, including carbon chemistry. These necessary conditions 
                for life are present in our universe as a consequence of the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
                which is made possible by the special values of the parameters.</i></p>
<p>There is good evidence that the anthropic observation is true. 
                Why it is true is a puzzle that <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> must solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> It is a daunting puzzle indeed. The strangely (and apparently 
              arbitrarily) biophilic quality of the physical laws and constants 
              poses, in Greene's view, the deepest question in all of science 
              (Greene, 2004). In the words of Davies (Gardner, 2003), it represents 
              "the biggest of the Big Questions: why is the universe bio-friendly?"</p>
<h3>Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> of Anthropic <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>ing</h3>
<p> Modern statements of the cosmological anthropic principle date 
              from the publication of a landmark book by Henderson in 1913 entitled 
              <i>The Fitness of the Environment</i> (Henderson, 1913). Henderson's 
              book was an extended reflection on the curious fact that there are 
              particular substances present in the environment&#8212;preeminently 
              water&#8212;whose peculiar qualities rendered the environment almost 
              preternaturally suitable for the origin, maintenance, and evolution 
              of organic life. Indeed, the strangely life-friendly qualities of 
              these materials led Henderson to the view that "we were obliged 
              to regard this collocation of properties in some intelligible <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> 
              a preparation for the process of planetary evolution.... Therefore 
              the properties of the <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s must for the present be regarded 
              as possessing a teleological character."</p>
<p> Thoroughly modern in outlook, Henderson dismissed this apparent 
              evidence that inanimate nature exhibited a teleological character 
              as indicative of divine design or purpose. Indeed, he rejected the 
              notion that nature's seemingly teleological quality was in any way 
              inconsistent with Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. 
              On the contrary, he viewed the bio-friendly character of the inanimate 
              natural environment as essential to the optimal <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of the 
              evolutionary forces in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biosphere_entry.html">biosphere</a>. Absent the <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> of a 
              superbly "fit" inanimate environment, Henderson contended, Darwinian 
              evolution could never have achieved what it has in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> 
              multiplication and diversification.</p>
<p> The mystery of <i>why</i> the physical qualities of the inanimate 
              universe happened to be so oddly conducive to life and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              evolution remained just that for Henderson&#8212;an impenetrable 
              mystery. The best he could do to solve the puzzle was to speculate 
              that the laws of chemistry were somehow fine-tuned in advance by 
              some unknown cosmic evolutionary mechanism to meet the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> needs 
              of a living biosphere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The properties of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and the course of cosmic evolution are 
                now seen to be intimately related to the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of the living 
                being and to its activities; they become, therefore, far more 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> than has previously been suspected. For the 
                whole evolutionary process, both cosmic and organic, is one, and 
                the biologist may now rightly regard the Universe in its very 
                essence as biocentric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Henderson's iconoclastic vision was far ahead of its time. His 
              potentially revolutionary book was largely ignored by his contemporaries 
              or dismissed as a mere tautology. <i>Of course</i> there should 
              be a close match-up between the physical requirements of life and 
              the physical world that life inhabits, contemporary skeptics pointed 
              out, since life evolved to survive the very challenges presented 
              by that pre-organic world and to take advantage of the biochemical 
              opportunities it offered.</p>
<p> While lacking broad influence at the time, Henderson's pioneering 
              vision proved to be the precursor to modern formulations of the 
              cosmological anthropic principle. One of the first such formulations 
              was offered by British astronomer Fred Hoyle. A storied chapter 
              in the history of the principle is the oft-told tale of Hoyle's 
              prediction of the details of the triple-alpha process (Mitton 2005). 
              This prediction, which seems to qualify as the first falsifiable 
              implication to flow from an anthropic hypothesis, involves the details 
              of the process by which the element carbon (widely viewed as the 
              essential element of abiotic precursor polymers capable of autocatalyzing 
              the emergence of living entities) emerges through stellar nucleosynthesis. 
              As noted by Livio (Livio, 2003):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carbon features in most anthropic arguments. In particular, it 
                is often argued that the existence of an excited state of the 
                carbon <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> is a manifestation of fine-tuning of the constants 
                of nature that allowed for the appearance of carbon-based life. 
                Carbon is formed through the triple-alpha process in two steps. 
                In the first, two alpha <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s form an unstable (lifetime ~10<sup>-16</sup>s)<sup>8</sup>Be. 
                In the second, a third alpha particle is captured, via <sup>8</sup>Be(&#945;,&#947;)<sup>12</sup><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. 
                Hoyle argued than in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> for the 3&#945; reaction to proceed 
                at a rate sufficient to produce the observed cosmic carbon, a 
                resonant level must exist in <sup>12</sup>C, a few hundred keV 
                about the <sup>8</sup>Be+<sup>4</sup>He threshold. Such a level 
                was indeed found <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Other chapters in the modern history of the anthropic principle 
              are treated comprehensively by Barrow and Tipler (Barrow and Tipler, 
              1988) and will not be revisited here.</p>
<h3>The New Urgency of Anthropic Investigation</h3>
<p> Two recent developments have imparted a renewed sense of urgency 
              to investigations of the anthropic qualities of our cosmos. The 
              first is the discovery that the value of dark <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> density is 
              exceedingly small but not quite zero&#8212;an apparent happenstance, 
              unpredictable from first principles, with profound implications 
              for the bio-friendly quality of our universe. As noted recently 
              by Goldsmith (Goldsmith, 2004):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A relatively straightforward calculation [based on established 
                principles of theoretical physics] does yield a theoretical value 
                for the <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmological_constant_entry.html">cosmological constant</a>, but that value is greater than 
                the measured one by a factor of about 10<sup>120</sup>&#8212;probably 
                the largest discrepancy between theory and observation science 
                has ever had to bear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the cosmological constant had a smaller value than that suggested 
                by recent observations, it would cause no trouble (just as one 
                would expect, remembering the happy days when the constant was 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to be zero). But if the constant were a few times larger 
                than it is now, the universe would have expanded so rapidly that 
                galaxies could not have endured for the billions of years necessary 
                to bring forth complex forms of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> The second development is the realization that M-theory&#8212;arguably 
              the most promising contemporary candidate for a theory capable of 
              yielding a deep <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> and quantum physics&#8212;permits, 
              in Bjorken's phrase (Bjorken, 2004), "a variety of string vacuua, 
              with different standard-model properties."</p>
<p> M-theorists had initially hoped that their new <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> would 
              be "brittle" in the sense of yielding a single mathematically unavoidable 
              solution that uniquely explained the seemingly arbitrary parameters 
              of the Standard Model. As Susskind has put it (Susskind, 2003):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world-view shared by most physicists is that the laws of 
                nature are uniquely described by some special <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> principle 
                that completely determines the <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, the spectrum of elementary 
                particles, the forces and the symmetries. <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">Experience</a> with quantum 
                electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics suggests a world with 
                a small number of parameters and a unique ground state. For the 
                most part, string theorists bought into this paradigm. At first 
                it was hoped that <a class="thought" href="entries/string_theory_entry.html">string theory</a> would be unique and explain the 
                various parameters that quantum field theory left unexplained. 
              </p>

<p> </p>
<p> This hope has been dashed by the recent discovery that the number 
              of different solutions permitted by M-theory (which correspond to 
              different values of Standard Model parameters) is, in Susskind's 
              words, "astronomical, measured not in millions or billions but in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/google_entry.html">google</a>s or googleplexes." This development seems to deprive our 
              most promising new theory of fundamental physics of the power to 
              uniquely predict the emergence of anything remotely resembling our 
              universe. As Susskind puts it, the picture of the universe that 
              is emerging from the deep mathematical recesses of M-theory is not 
              an "elegant universe" but rather a Rube Goldberg <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, cobbled 
              together by some unknown process in a supremely improbable manner 
              that just happens to render the whole ensemble fit for life. In 
              the words of University of California theoretical physicist Steve 
              Giddings, "No longer can we follow the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of discovering the 
              unique equations that predict everything we see, and writing them 
              on a single page. Predicting the constants of nature becomes a messy 
              environmental problem. It has the complications of biology."[<a href="#one">1</a>]</p>
<h3>Two Contemporary Restatements of the Weak Anthropic Principle: 
              Eternal Inflation Plus M-Theory and Many-Worlds Quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">Cosmology</a></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> There have been two principal approaches to the task of enlisting 
              the weak anthropic principle to explain the mysteriously small (and 
              thus bio-friendly) value of the density of dark energy and the apparent 
              happenstance by which our bio-friendly universe was selected from 
              the enormously large "landscape" of possible solutions permitted 
              by M-theory, only a tiny fraction of which correspond to anything 
              resembling the Standard Model prevalent in our cosmos.</p>
<p> <i>Eternal Inflation Meets M-Theory</i></p>
<p> The first approach, favored by Susskind (Susskind, 2003). Linde 
              (Linde, 2002), Weinberg (Weinberg, 1999), and Vilenkin (Vilenkin, 
              2004) among others, overlays the model of eternal inflation with 
              the key assumption that M-theory-permitted solutions (corresponding 
              to different values of Standard Model parameters) and dark energy 
              density values will vary randomly from bubble universe to bubble 
              universe within an eternally expanding ensemble variously termed 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">multiverse</a> or a meta-univers. Generating a life-friendly cosmos 
              is simply a matter of randomly reshuffling the set of permissible 
              parameters and values a sufficient number of times until a particular 
              Big Bang yields, against odds of perhaps a googleplex-to-one, a 
              permutation that just happens to possess the right mix of Standard 
              Model parameters to be bio-friendly.</p>
<i>Sum-Over-Histories Quantum Cosmological Model</i>
<p> The second approach invokes a quantum theory-derived sum-over-histories 
              cosmological model inspired by Everett's "many worlds" interpretation 
              of quantum physics. This approach, which has been prominently embraced 
              by Hawking (Hawking and Hertog, 2002), was summarized as follows 
              by Hogan (Hogan, 2004):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the original formulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>, it was said 
                that an observation collapsed a wavefunction to one of the eignestates 
                of the observed quantity. The modern view is that the cosmic wavefunction 
                never collapses, but only appears to collapse from the point of 
                view of observers who are part of the wavefunction. When Schr&#246;dinger's 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/cat_entry.html">cat</a> lives or dies, the branch of the wavefunction with the dead 
                cat also contains observers who are dealing with a dead cat, and 
                the branch with the live cat also contains observers who are petting 
                a live one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although this is sometimes called the "Many Worlds" interpretation 
                of quantum mechanics, it is really about having just one world, 
                one wavefunction, obeying the Schr&#246;dinger equation: the wavefunction 
                evolves <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly from one time to the next based on its previous 
                state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anthropic selection in this sense is built into physics at the 
                most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> level of quantum mechanics. Selection of a wavefunction 
                branch is what drives us into circumstances in which we thrive. 
                Viewed from a disinterested perspective outside the universe, 
                it looks like living beings swim like salmon up their favorite 
                branches of the wavefunction, chasing their favorite places.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Hawking and Hertog (Hawking and Hertog, 2002) have explicitly 
              characterized this "top down" cosmological model as a restatement 
              of the weak anthropic principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have argued that because our universe has a quantum origin, 
                one must adopt a top down approach to the problem of initial conditions 
                in cosmology, in which histories that contribute to the path integral, 
                depend on the observable being measured. There is an amplitude 
                for empty flat <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, but it is not of much significance. Similarly, 
                the other bubbles in an eternally inflating spacetime are irrelevant. 
                They are to the future of our past <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> cone, so they don't contribute 
                to the action for observables and should be excised by Ockham's 
                razor. <i>Therefore, the top down approach is a mathematical formulation 
                of the weak anthropic principle.</i> Instead of starting with 
                a universe and asking what a typical observer would see, one specifies 
                the amplitude of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Critique of Contemporary Restatements of the Weak Anthropic Principle</h3>
<p> Apart from the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ions on the part of those who oppose in principle 
              any use of the anthropic principle in cosmology, there are at least 
              three reasons why both the Hawking/Hogan and the Susskind/Linde/Weinberg 
              restatements of the weak anthropic principle are objectionable.</p>
<p> First, both approaches appear to be resistant (at the very least) 
              to experimental testing. Universes spawned by Big Bangs other than 
              our own are inaccessible from our own universe, at least with the 
              experimental techniques currently available to science. So too are 
              quantum wavefunction branches that we cannot, in principle, observe. 
              Accordingly, both approaches appear to be untestable&#8212;perhaps 
              untestable in principle. For this reason, Smolin recently argued 
              (Smolin, 2004) "not only is the Anthropic Principle not science, 
              its role may be negative. To the extent that the Anthropic Principle 
              is espoused to justify continued interest in unfalsifiable theories, 
              it may play a destructive role in the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of science."</p>
<p> Second, both approaches violate the mediocrity principle. The 
              mediocrity principle, a mainstay of scientific theorizing since 
              Copernicus, is a statistically based rule of thumb that, absent 
              contrary evidence, a particular sample (Earth, for instance, or 
              our particular universe) should be assumed to be a typical example 
              of the ensemble of which it is a part. The Susskind/Linde/Weinberg 
              approach, in particular, flouts this principle. Their approach simply 
              takes refuge in a brute, unfathomable mystery&#8212;the conjectured 
              lucky roll of the dice in a crap game of eternal inflation&#8212;and 
              declines to probe seriously into the possibility of a naturalistic 
              cosmic evolutionary process that has the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to yield a life-friendly 
              set of physical laws and constants on a nonrandom basis.</p>
<p> Third, both approaches extravagantly inflate the probabilistic 
              resources required to explain the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> of a life-friendly 
              cosmos. (Think of a googleplex of monkeys typing away randomly until 
              one of them, by pure chance, accidentally composes a set of equations 
              that correspond to the Standard Model.) This should be a hint that 
              something fundamental is being overlooked and that there may exist 
              an unknown natural process, perhaps functionally akin in some manner 
              to terrestrial evolution, capable of effecting the emergence and 
              prolongation of physical states of nature that are, in the abstract, 
              vanishingly improbable.</p>
<h3>The Darwinian Precedent</h3>
<p> Hogan (Hogan, 2004) has <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ized the quantum theory-inspired 
              sum-over-histories version of the weak anthropic principle to Darwinian 
              theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This blending of empirical cosmology and fundamental physics 
                is reminiscent of our Darwinian understanding of the tree of life. 
                The double helix, the four-base codon alphabet and the triplet 
                genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> for amino acids, any particular gene for a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> 
                in a particular <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>&#8212;all are frozen accidents of evolutionary 
                history. It is futile to try to understand or explain these aspects 
                of life, or indeed any relationships in biology, without referring 
                to the way the history of life unfolded. In the same way that 
                (in Dobzhansky's phrase), "nothing in biology makes sense except 
                in the light of evolution," physics in these models only makes 
                sense in the light of cosmology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Ironically, Hogan misses the key point that neither the branching 
              wavefunction nor the eternal inflation-plus-M-theory versions of 
              the weak anthropic principle hypothesize the existence of anything 
              corresponding to the main action principle of Darwin's theory: natural 
              selection. Both restatements of the weak anthropic principle are 
              analogous, not to Darwin's approach, but rather to a mythical alternative 
              history in which Darwin, contemplating the storied tangled bank 
              (the arresting visual image with which he concludes <i>The Origin 
              of Species</i>), had confessed not a magnificent obsession with 
              gaining an understanding of the mysterious natural processes that 
              had yielded "endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful," but 
              rather a smug satisfaction that of course the earthly biosphere 
              must have somehow evolved in a just-so manner mysteriously friendly 
              to humans and other currently living species, or else Darwin and 
              other humans would not be around to contemplate it.</p>
<p> Indeed, the situation that confronts cosmologists today is reminiscent 
              of that which faced biologists before Darwin propounded his revolutionary 
              theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin confronted 
              the seemingly miraculous phenomenon of a fine-tuned natural order 
              in which every creature and plant appeared to occupy a unique and 
              well-designed niche. Refusing to surrender to the brute mystery 
              posed by the appearance of nature's design, Darwin masterfully deployed 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> of metaphor[<a href="#two">2</a>] to elucidate a radical 
              hypothesis&#8212;the origin of species through natural selection&#8212;that 
              explained the apparent miracle as a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p> A significant lesson drawn from Darwin's experience is important 
              to note at this point. Answering the question of why the most eminent 
              geologists and naturalists had, until shortly before publication 
              of <i>The Origin of Species</i>, disbelieved in the mutability of 
              species, Darwin responded that this false conclusion was "almost 
              inevitable as long as the history of the world was thought to be 
              of short duration." It was geologist Charles Lyell's speculations 
              on the immense age of Earth that provided the essential <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual 
              framework for Darwin's new theory. Lyell's vastly expanded stretch 
              of geological time provided an ample temporal arena in which the 
              forces of natural selection could sculpt and reshape the species 
              of Earth and achieve nearly limitless variation.</p>
<p> The central point for purposes of this paper is that collateral 
              advances in sciences seemingly far removed from cosmology (complexity 
              theory and evolutionary theory among them) can help dissipate the 
              intellectual limitations imposed by <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> and na&#239;ve 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>. And, in an uncanny reprise of the Lyell/Darwin 
              intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/synergy_entry.html">synergy</a>, it is a realization of the vastness of time 
              and history that gives rise to the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> theoretical possibility 
              to be discussed subsequently. Only in this instance, it is the vastness 
              of future time and future history that is of crucial importance. 
              In particular, sharp attention must be paid to the key conclusion 
              of Wheeler: most of the time available for life and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              to achieve their ultimate capabilities lie in the distant cosmic 
              future, not in the cosmic past. As Tipler (Tipler, 1994) has stated, 
              "Almost all of space and time lies in the future. By focusing attention 
              only on the past and present, science has ignored almost all of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of scientific study is the whole of reality, 
              it is about time science decided to study the future evolution of 
              the universe." The next section of this paper describes an attempt 
              to heed these admonitions.</p>
<h3>The Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis</h3>
<p> In a paper published in <i>Complexity</i> (Gardner, 2000), I first 
              advanced the hypothesis that the anthropic qualities which our universe 
              exhibits might be explained as incidental consequences of a cosmic 
              replication cycle in which the emergence of a cosmologically extended 
              biosphere could conceivably supply two of the logically essential 
              elements of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> identified by von Neumann (von Neumann, 
              1948): a controller and a duplicating device. The hypothesis proposed 
              in that paper was an attempt to extend and refine Smolin's conjecture 
              (Smolin, 1997) that the majority of the anthropic qualities of the 
              universe can be explained as incidental consequences of a process 
              of cosmological replication and natural selection (CNS) whose <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> 
              function is black hole maximization. Smolin's conjecture differs 
              crucially from the concept of eternal inflation advanced by Linde 
              (Linde, 1998) in that it proposes a cosmological evolutionary process 
              with a specific and discernible utility function&#8212;black hole 
              maximization. It is this aspect of Smolin's conjecture rather than 
              the specific utility function he advocates that renders his theoretical 
              approach genuinely novel.</p>
<p> As demonstrated previously (Rees, 1997; Baez, 1998), Smolin's 
              conjecture suffers from two evident defects: (1) the fundamental 
              physical laws and constants do not, in fact, appear to be fine-tuned 
              to favor black hole maximization and (2) no mechanism is proposed 
              corresponding to two logically required elements of any von Neumann 
              self-replicating automaton: a controller and a duplicator.[<a href="#three">3</a>] 
              The latter are essential elements of any replicator <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> capable 
              of Darwinian evolution, as noted by Dawkins (Gardner, 2000) in a 
              critique of Smolin's conjecture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that any Darwinian theory depends on the prior existence 
                of the strong phenomenon of heredity. There have to be self-replicating 
                entities (in a population of such entities) that spawn daughter 
                entities more like themselves than the general population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Theories of cosmological <a class="thought" href="entries/eschatology_entry.html">eschatology</a> previously articulated (Kurzweil, 
              1999; Wheeler, 1996; Dyson, 1988) predict that the ongoing process 
              of biological and technological evolution is sufficiently robust 
              and unbounded that, in the far distant future, a cosmologically 
              extended biosphere could conceivably exert a global influence on 
              the physical state of the cosmos. A related set of insights from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_theory_entry.html">complexity theory</a> (Gardner, 2000) indicates that the process of 
              emergence resulting from such evolution is essentially unbounded.</p>
<p> A synthesis of these two sets of insights yielded the two key 
              elements of the Selfish Biocosm (SB) hypothesis. The essence of 
              that synthesis is that the ongoing process of biological and technological 
              evolution and emergence could conceivably function as a von Neumann 
              controller and that a cosmologically extended biosphere could, in 
              the very distant future, function as a von Neumann duplicator in 
              a hypothesized process of cosmological replication.</p>
<p> In a paper published in <i>Acta Astronautica</i> (Gardner, 2001) 
              I suggested that a falsifiable implication of the SB hypothesis 
              is that the process of the progression of the cosmos through critical 
              epigenetic thresholds in its life cycle, while perhaps not strictly 
              inevitable, is relatively robust. One such critical threshold is 
              the emergence of human-level and higher intelligence, which is essential 
              to the eventual scaling up of biological and technological processes 
              to the stage at which those processes could conceivably exert a 
              global influence on the state of the cosmos. Four specific tests 
              of the robustness of the emergence of human-level and higher intelligence 
              were proposed.</p>
<p> In a subsequent paper published in the <i>Journal of the British 
              Interplanetary <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a></i> (Gardner, 2002) I proposed that an additional 
              falsifiable implication of the SB hypothesis is that there exists 
              a plausible final state of the cosmos that exhibits maximal <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al 
              potential. This predicted final state appeared to be consistent 
              with both the modified ekpyrotic cyclic universe scenario (Khoury, 
              Ovrut, Seiberg, Steinhardt, and Turok, 2001; Steinhardt and Turok, 
              2001) and with Lloyd's description (Lloyd, 2000) of the physical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s of the ultimate computational device: a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as powerful 
              as the laws of physics will allow.</p>
<h3>Key Retrodiction of the SB Hypothesis: A Life-Friendly Cosmos</h3>
<p> The central assertions of the SB hypothesis are: (1) that highly 
              evolved life and intelligence play an essential role in a hypothesized 
              process of cosmic replication and (2) that the peculiarly life-friendly 
              laws and physical constants that prevail in our universe&#8212;an 
              extraordinarily improbable ensemble that Pagels dubbed the cosmic 
              code (Pagels, 1983)&#8212;play a cosmological role functionally equivalent 
              to that of DNA in an earthly organism: they provide a recipe for 
              cosmic ontogeny and a blueprint for cosmic reproduction. Thus, a 
              key retrodiction of the SB hypothesis is that the suite of physical 
              laws and constants that prevail in our cosmos will, in fact, be 
              life-friendly. Moreover&#8212;and alone among the various cosmological 
              scenarios offered to explain the phenomenon of a bio-friendly universe&#8212;the 
              SB hypothesis implies that this suite of laws and constants comprise 
              a robust <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that will reliably generate life and advanced intelligence 
              just as the DNA of a particular species constitutes a robust program 
              that will reliably generate <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> organisms that are members 
              of that particular species. Indeed, because the hypothesis asserts 
              that sufficiently evolved intelligent life serves as a von Neumann 
              duplicator in a putative process of cosmological replication, the 
              biophilic quality of the suite emerges as a retrodicted biosignature 
              of the putative duplicator and duplication process within the meaning 
              of Goal 7 of the NASA Astrobiology Roadmap, which provides in pertinent 
              part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determine how to recognize signatures of life on other worlds 
                and on early Earth. Identify biosignatures that can reveal and 
                characterize past or present life in ancient samples from Earth, 
                extraterrestrial samples measured <i>in situ</i>, samples returned 
                to Earth, remotely measured planetary atmospheres and surfaces, 
                and <i>other cosmic phenomena</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Does this retrodiction qualify as a valid scientific test of the 
              validity of the SB hypothesis? I propose that it may, provided two 
              additional qualifying criteria are satisfied:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The underlying hypothesis must enjoy <a class="thought" href="entries/consilience_entry.html">consilience</a>[<a href="#four">4</a>] 
                with mainstream scientific paradigms and conjectural frameworks 
                (in particular, complexity theory, evolutionary theory, M-theory, 
                and theoretically acceptable conjectures by mainstream cosmologists 
                concerning the feasibility, at least in principle, of "baby universe" 
                fabrication); and</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The retrodiction must be augmented by falsifiable predictions 
                of phenomena implied by the SB hypothesis but not yet observed. 
              </li>
</ul>
<h3>Retrodiction as a Tool for Testing Scientific Hypotheses</h3>
<p> There is a lively literature debating the propriety of employing 
              retrodiction as a tool for testing scientific hypotheses (Cleland, 
              2002; Cleland, 2001; Gee, 1999; Oldershaw, 1988). Oldershaw (Oldershaw, 
              1988) has discussed the use of falsifiable retrodiction (as opposed 
              to falsifiable prediction) as a tool of scientific investigation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A second type of prediction is actually not a prediction at all, 
                but rather a "retrodiction." For example, the anomalous advance 
                of the perihelion of Mercury had been a tiny thorn in the side 
                of Newtonian gravitation long before general relativity came upon 
                the scene. Einstein found that his theory correctly "predicted," 
                actually retrodicted, the numerical value of the perihelion advance. 
                The explanation of the unexpected result of the Michelson-Morley 
                experiment (constancy of the <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> of light) in terms of special 
                relativity is another example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> As he went on to note, "Retrodictions usually represent falsification 
              tests; the theory is probably wrong if it fails the test, but should 
              not necessarily be considered right if it passes the test since 
              it does not involve a definitive prediction." Despite their legitimacy 
              as falsification tests of hypotheses, falsifiable retrodictions 
              are qualitatively inferior to falsifiable predictions, in Oldershaw's 
              view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, in the final analysis, only true definitive predictions 
                can justify the promotion of a theory from being viewed as one 
                of many plausible hypotheses to being recognized as the best available 
                approximation of how nature actually works. A theory that cannot 
                generate definitive predictions, or whose definitive predictions 
                are impossible to test, can be regarded as inherently untestable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> A less sympathetic view concerning the validity of retrodiction 
              as a scientific tool was offered by Gee (Gee, 1999), who dismissed 
              the legitimacy of all historical hypotheses on the ground that "they 
              can never be tested by experiment, and so they are unscientific.... 
              No science can ever be historical." This viewpoint, in turn, has 
              been challenged by Cleland (Cleland, 2001) who contends that "when 
              it comes to testing hypotheses, historical science is not inferior 
              to classical experimental science" but simply exploits the available 
              evidence in a different way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There [are] fundamental differences in the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology used by 
                historical and experimental scientists. Experimental scientists 
                focus on a single (sometimes complex) hypothesis, and the main 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> activity consists in repeatedly bringing about the test 
                conditions specified by the hypothesis, and controlling for extraneous 
                factors that might produce false positives and false negatives. 
                Historical scientists, in contrast, usually concentrate on formulating 
                multiple competing hypotheses about particular past events. Their 
                main research efforts are directed at <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for a smoking 
                gun, a trace that sets apart one hypothesis as providing a better 
                causal explanation (for the observed traces) than do the others. 
                These differences in methodology do not, however, support the 
                claim that historical science is methodologically inferior, because 
                they reflect an objective difference in the evidential relations 
                at the disposal of historical and experimental researchers for 
                evaluating their hypotheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Cleland's approach has the merit of preserving as "scientific" 
              some of the most important hypotheses advanced in such historical 
              fields of inquiry as geology, evolutionary biology, cosmology, paleontology, 
              and archaeology. As Cleland has noted (Cleland, 2002):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experimental research is commonly held up at the paradigm of 
                successful (a.k.a.good) science. The role classically attributed 
                to experiment is that of testing hypotheses in controlled laboratory 
                settings. Not all scientific hypotheses can be tested in this 
                manner, however. Historical hypotheses about the remote past provide 
                good examples. Although fields such as paleontology and archaeology 
                provide the familiar examples, historical hypotheses are also 
                common in geology, biology, planetary science, <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">astronomy</a>, and 
                astrophysics. The focus of historical research is on explaining 
                existing natural phenomena in terms of long past causes. Two <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> 
                examples are the asteroid-impact hypothesis for the <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> 
                of the dinosaurs, which explains the fossil record of the dinosaurs 
                in terms of the impact of a large asteroid, and the "big-bang" 
                theory of the origin of the universe, which explains the puzzling 
                isotropic three-degree background radiation in terms of a primordial 
                explosion. Such work is significantly different from making a 
                prediction and then artificially creating a phenomenon in a laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> In a paper presented to the <i>2004 Astrobiology Science Conference</i> 
              (Cleland, 2004), Cleland extended this analytic framework to the 
              consideration of putative biosignatures as evidence of the past 
              or present existence of extraterrestrial life. Acknowledging that 
              "because biosignatures represent indirect traces (effects) of life, 
              much of the research will be historical (vs. experimental) in character 
              even in cases where the traces represent recent effects of putative 
              extant organisms," Cleland concluded that it was appropriate to 
              employ the methodology that characterizes successful historical 
              research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Successful historical research is characterized by (1) the proliferation 
                of alternative competing hypotheses in the face of puzzling evidence 
                and (2) the search for more evidence (a "smoking gun") to discriminate 
                among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> From the perspective of the evidentiary standards applicable to 
              historical science in general and astrobiology in particular, the 
              key retrodiction of the SB hypothesis&#8212;that the fundamental 
              constants of nature that comprise the Standard Model as well as 
              other physical features of our cosmos (included the number of extended 
              physical dimensions and the extremely low value of dark energy) 
              will be collectively bio-friendly&#8212;appears to constitute a legitimate 
              scientific test of the hypothesis. Moreover, within the framework 
              of Goal 7 of the NASA Astrobiology Roadmap, the retrodicted biophilic 
              quality of our universe appears, under the SB hypothesis, to constitute 
              a possible biosignature.</p>
<h3>Caution Regarding the Use of Retrodiction to Test the SB Hypothesis</h3>
<p> Because the SB hypothesis is radically novel and because the use 
              of falsifiable retrodiction as a tool to test such an hypothesis 
              creates at least the appearance of a "confirmatory argument resemble[ing] 
              just-so stories (Rudyard Kipling's fanciful stories, e.g., how leopards 
              got their spots)" (Cleland, 2001), it is important (as noted previously) 
              that two additional criteria be satisfied before this retrodiction 
              can be considered a legitimate test of the hypothesis:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The SB hypothesis must generate falsifiable predictions as well 
                as falsifiable retrodictions; and</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The SB hypothesis must be consilient with key theoretical constructs 
                in such "adjoining" area of scientific investigation as M-theory, 
                cosmogenesis, complexity theory, and evolutionary theory.</li>
</ul>
<p> As argued at length elsewhere (Gardner, 2003), the SB hypothesis 
              is both consilient with central concepts in these "adjoining" fields 
              and fully capable of generating falsifiable predictions.</p>
<h3> Concluding Remarks</h3>
<p> In his book <i>The Fifth Miracle</i> (Davies, 1999) Davies offered 
              this interpretation of NASA's view that the presence of liquid water 
              on an alien world was a reliable marker of a life-friendly environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In claiming that water means life, NASA scientists are... making&#8212;tacitly&#8212;a 
                huge and profound assumption about the nature of nature. They 
                are saying, in effect, that the laws of the universe are cunningly 
                contrived to coax life into being against the raw odds; that the 
                mathematical principles of physics, in their elegant simplicity, 
                somehow know in advance about life and its vast complexity. If 
                life follows from [primordial] soup with causal dependability, 
                the laws of nature encode a hidden subtext, a cosmic imperative, 
                which tells them: "Make life!" And, through life, its by-products: 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, understanding. It means that the laws of the 
                universe have <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered their own comprehension. This is a breathtaking 
                vision of nature, magnificent and uplifting in its <a class="thought" href="entries/majestic_entry.html">majestic</a> sweep. 
                I hope it is correct. It would be wonderful if it were correct. 
                But if it is, it represents a shift in the scientific world-view 
                as profound as that initiated by Copernicus and Darwin put together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> An emerging consensus among mainstream physicists and cosmologists 
              is that the particular universe we inhabit appears to confirm what 
              Smolin calls the "anthropic observation": the laws and constants 
              of nature seem to be fine-tuned, with extraordinary precision and 
              against enormous odds, to favor the emergence of life and its byproduct, 
              intelligence. As Dyson put it eloquently more than two decades ago 
              (Dyson, 1979):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I examine the universe and study the details of its 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>, the more evidence I find that the universe in some 
                sense must have known that we were coming. There are some striking 
                examples in the laws of nuclear physics of numerical accidents 
                that seem to conspire to make the universe habitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> Why this should be so remains a profound mystery. Indeed, the 
              mystery has deepened considerably with the recent discovery of the 
              inexplicably tiny value of dark energy density and the realization 
              that M-theory encompasses an unfathomably vast landscape of possible 
              solutions, only a minute fraction of which correspond to anything 
              resembling the universe that we inhabit.</p>
<p> Confronted with such a deep mystery, the scientific community 
              ought to be willing to entertain plausible explanatory hypotheses 
              that may appear to be unconventional or even radical. However, such 
              hypotheses, to be taken seriously, must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be consilient with the key paradigms of "adjoining" scientific 
                fields,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>generate falsifiable predictions, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>generate falsifiable retrodictions.</li>
</ul>
<p> The SB hypothesis satisfies these criteria. In particular, it 
              generates a falsifiable retrodiction that the physical laws and 
              constants that prevail in our cosmos will be biophilic&#8212;which 
              they are.</p>

<p><a name="two"></a>[2] The metaphor furnished by the familiar process 
              of artificial selection was Darwin's crucial stepping stone. Indeed, 
              the practice of artificial selection through plant and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> breeding 
              was the primary intellectual model that guided Darwin in his quest 
              to solve the mystery of the origin of species and to demonstrate 
              in principle the plausibility of his theory that variation and natural 
              selection were the prime movers responsible for the phenomenon of 
              speciation.</p>
<p><a name="three"></a>[3] Both defects were emphasized by Susskind 
              in a recent on-line exchange with Smolin which appears at <a href="www.edge.org" target="_blank">www.edge.org</a>. 
              Smolin has argued that his CNS hypothesis has not been falsified 
              on the first ground (Smolin, 2004) but conceded that his conjecture 
              lacks any hypothesized mechanism that would endow the putative process 
              of proliferation of black-hole-prone universes with a heredity function:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hypothesis that the parameters <i>p</i> change, on average, 
                by small random amounts, should be ultimately grounded in fundamental 
                physics. We note that this is compatible with string theory, in 
                the sense that there are a great many string vacua, which likely 
                populate the space of low energy parameters well. It is plausible 
                that when a region of the universe is squeezed to Planck densities 
                and heated to Planck temperatures, phase transitions may occur 
                leading to a transition from one string vacua to another. But 
                there have so far been no detailed studies of these processes 
                which would check the hypothesis that the change in each generation 
                is small.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>As Smolin noted in the same paper, it is crucial that such a mechanism 
              exist in order to avoid the conclusion that each new universe's 
              set of physical laws and constants would constitute a merely random 
              sample of the vast parameter space permitted by the extraordinarily 
              large "landscape" of M-theory-allowed solutions:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the process of natural selection 
                is very different from a random sprinkling of universes on the 
                parameter space <i>P</i>. This would produce only a uniform distribution 
                <i>p<sub>random</sub>(p)</i>. To achieve a distribution peaked 
                around the local maxima of a fitness function requires the two 
                conditions specified. The change in each generation must be small 
                so that the distribution can "climb the hills" in <i>F(p)</i> 
                rather than jump around randomly, and so it can stay in the small 
                volume of <i>P</i> where <i>F(p)</i> is large, and not diffuse 
                away. This requires many steps to reach local maxima from random 
                starts, which implies that long chains of descendants are needed.</p>
</blockquote>

              of the "diagnostic features of science that distinguishes it from 
              pseudoscience" (Wilson, 1998):</p>
<p>The explanations of different phenomena most likely to survive 
              are those that can be connected and proved consistent with one another.</p>

<br>
          Murray's Law: Eternal Exponential Expansion of Science
<br>
<br>
     Millenia of worldwide commonsense traditions have culminated in a
<br>
recent few centuries of exponential scientific work.  Since 1660, the
<br>
number of scientists has grown from about 100 to about 10,000,000.
<br>
Likewise,  the volume of accumulated scientific literature,  both
<br>
doubling unstopably every twenty years,  rather like Mickey Mouse's
<br>
hordes of relentlessly marching brooms in Disney's "The Sorcerer's
<br>
Apprentice".....
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gardner's thought, however, is still grounded in some primary root 
<br>
assumptions:
<br>
reality is single-level, evolving only-time forward in a single dimension and level
<br>
of one-way causality flow, strictly from nearest neighbors in space and time.
<br>
<br>
Those of us who have had the surprisingly common experiences
<br>
of ordinary daily life precognition, including some theoreticians,
<br>
have reason to ponder how to expand scientific and mathematical visions to
<br>
accomodate multi-level reality manifolds with infinite-dimensional spaces and
<br>
times (flows of causality), with noncontiguous properties.
<br>
<br>
How might we expand the concept of the Mandelbrot Set, for example,
<br>
to include iteration operators that connect widely separated, not just
<br>
contiguous, points?  Or cellular automata?
<br>
<br>
On all fronts, the playground is vast.

    "One way of viewing the Millennium is that the Infinite
<br>
would again take finite incarnation to benefit beings at a certain point in
<br>
space and time.Although such an occurrence is always welcome, we should
<br>
be aware that the infinite is always present and place our emphasis on
<br>
recognizing that. Otherwise, we are always stuck in finite, relative 
<br>
reality, where the concepts of space and time constrain and solidify our 
<br>
experience. It is exactly beyond the relative reality in which the concepts 
<br>
of space and time exist that we contact the infinite, space and time being 
<br>
constructs co-emergent with our finite incarnate mind-body system...."

<br>
Since I have often had precognitive dreams about ordinary events the next 
<br>
day since 1982, it follows that, since "subjective" experience is a 
<br>
co-existing aspect, along with the imputed "objective external physical 
<br>
reality", of the single infinite unity, then the widely conjectured single 
<br>
linear flow of time and casuality must necessarily be recast within a much 
<br>
broader view, in which every "future" point directly interacts with every 
<br>
"past" point.
<br>
<br>
As Feinman and others have often found to be a useful metaprinciple:
<br>
"What is not prohibited, is mandatory."
<br>
<br>
The trajectory of interactions that comprise the world line or world tube of 
<br>
a history is not only driven by one-way directional time (casuality)  from 
<br>
adjacent instants in next neighbor locations, conveyed by some exchange of 
<br>
information conveying energy, but also by contributions by two-way 
<br>
transactions from every "future" instant and location, and therefore, every 
<br>
"past" location, ie, the entire trajectory evolves simultanously and 
<br>
perpetually.
<br>
<br>
This might be imaged as a "sideways" time (casuality) flow in an infinity of 
<br>
"sideways" dimensions along the entire line of any trajectory of history: 
<br>
then there would be unlimited realms of "parallel", "alternative"
<br>
histories, which all interact "sideways" among each other.
<br>
<br>
What seems to be a single strand of history would turn out to be a complex 
<br>
rope of somewhat similar histories.
<br>
<br>
All of this is forever spontaneously, creatively, freely evolving at every 
<br>
point of "time" and "place".
<br>
<br>
Are there any available mathematical frameworks for this?
<br>
<br>
If we choose look for them, casting aside centuries of allegiance to linear 
<br>
time, will we find that certain models that might indicate avenues to 
<br>
resolve various paradoxes and dilemmas in fundamental physics?
<br>
<br>
Would not the infinite, which is what is indubitably here, be inviting "us" 
<br>
to open together into vast new realms of experience, understanding, and 
<br>
cognition?
<br>
<br>
This has some bearing on the remarkable fact that the miniscule, remarkably 
<br>
uniform and featureless, Big Bang has managed to generate this moment of 
<br>
experience, in which these little black   m a  r   k    s    in "your" 
<br>
visual awareness instantly elicit subtle complex understandings in other 
<br>
aspects of your awareness, related somewhat to events in "my" awareness.

CSICON, Communion for the Subjective Investigation of Claims of the Normal: Murray's Law: Eternal Exponential Expansion of Science:
<br>
Murray 1997.04.05
<br>
<br>
     Millenia of worldwide commonsense traditions have culminated in a
<br>
recent few centuries of exponential scientific work.  Since 1660, the
<br>
number of scientists has grown from about 100 to about 10,000,000.
<br>
Likewise,  the volume of accumulated scientific literature,  both
<br>
doubling unstopably every twenty years,  rather like Mickey Mouse's
<br>
hordes of relentlessly marching brooms in Disney's "The Sorcerer's
<br>
Apprentice".
<br>
<br>
     This global orchestration of thought and practice has been firmly
<br>
founded on certain principles,  rarely questioned and widely held to be
<br>
unquestionable.  Experience is held to be entirely based on and derived
<br>
from a basic reality, itself "external" to experience: physical,
<br>
or more abstractly, time-space-energy.
<br>
<br>
     This base reality is universally assumed to be impersonal,
<br>
consistent, orderly, lawful, causal, uniform, single, measurable,
<br>
describable and communicable, continuous, contiguous,
<br>
inherently simple, and based on a small set of unchangeable (in
<br>
themselves) logical-mathematical operations.
<br>
Therefore this reality can be modeled
<br>
and predicted by the self-qualifying global society of scientists,
<br>
based solely on communication by the external senses.
<br>
<br>
     In short, the primary reality, and its derivative, conscious
<br>
experience, is absolutely normal.  The primary image of this paradigm
<br>
is that of the machine, or the modern embodiment, the computer:
<br>
well-defined elements interacting in three-dimensional space along a
<br>
single one-way track of causality to produce utterly normal results,
<br>
however marvelous, varied, valuable, or unpredictable they may be in
<br>
practice.
<br>
<br>
     This towering structure of established normality paradoxically
<br>
both hides and makes even more significant any hints of "nonnormality".
<br>
Hitherto, "anomalies", such as random variations in offspring,  the
<br>
fogging of sealed photographic plates by uranium ore,  or slight static
<br>
in sensitive radios, have become mere fodder for the assimilation
<br>
program of science, leading to vast extensions of the range of the
<br>
normal, including evolution, quantum mechanics, and the Big Bang.
<br>
"Resistance is futile.  You will be assimilated"-- the implacable
<br>
marching song of the Borg juggarnaut.
<br>
<br>
     Willem of Occam proclaimed, "Thou shalt not multiply entities
<br>
needlessly."  Indeed, hordes of angels, demons, ghosts, spirits,
<br>
influences, and innate qualities have been relegated to that final
<br>
dustbin of our race's mythic heritage,  children's Saturday morning
<br>
cartoons.  Mature minds, entranced by ever more lofty and subtle
<br>
theoretical visions, fed feasts of observation and experimentation on
<br>
every level, constrained by principles of parsimony, generality, and
<br>
elegance, have exuburantly, soberly created in a mere century:
<br>
<br>
at the ever tapering tail of the dragon, atoms that are .999999 empty
<br>
space,
<br>
<br>
said empty space as a fully occupied negative energy sea of prodigious
<br>
density,  with incessant particle pair production-annihilation within
<br>
that good old vacuum,
<br>
<br>
the equivalence of mass and energy,
<br>
<br>
the relativistic variation of observed time,
<br>
with irreducible randomness, fuzziness, discontinuity,
<br>
and, feh!, nonlocality at the very core of reality,
<br>
<br>
the weird phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity,
<br>
<br>
the ever fecund  boson-fermion zoo of baryons, mesons, quarks, gluons,
<br>
neutrinos, WIMPs, gravitons, Higg's, magnetic monopoles, and their
<br>
antis, and their superpartners, all cascading into actuality as
<br>
infinitesimal loops or membranes vibrating within that most spacious
<br>
crystal of abstraction, E8XE8 Group (The Monster) Symmetry,  while
<br>
now 7 additional dimensions of space are parsimoniously mandated.
<br>
Whew!
<br>
<br>
meanwhile, at the ever bigger end of said dragon,
<br>
suddenly the galaxy!,
<br>
sprinkled with pulsars and quasars,  oh!, then an expanding universe of
<br>
galaxies,  salted with gamma-ray bursters,  oh!, that all sprang into
<br>
being as a space-time bubble with zero total energy as an infinitesimal
<br>
quantum vacuum fluctuation in "something",  oh!, our bubble of galaxies
<br>
extends 10E+25 further than the 15 billion light years presently
<br>
observable (that's 10E+75 greater volumn, folks),  oh!, might be untold
<br>
zillions of universe bubbles, forever disconnected, each with unique
<br>
intrinsic properties, effervescing cheerily within "something",  just
<br>
the facts, Mam, heh, heh.  Funny what the principle of parsimony leads
<br>
to...
<br>
<br>
gee whiz,  I near forgot,  black holes, them's wierd nuff, huh?  Lot of
<br>
'em, too, all sizes!   Oops, they evaporate!   Blow up too!   Wow!
<br>
Gravitation radiation, anyone?  We can plain see gravitational lensing!
<br>
How about cosmic string  and cosmic texture, frozen phase changes in
<br>
space-time itself?
<br>
<br>
remember, if it ain't prohibited, it mandatory.  Yep!    (Is anything
<br>
really prohibited?)  .
<br>
<br>
     I'm not complaining.  It's surely wonderful.  We taxpayers are
<br>
getting our money's worth, and then some.  But do you see any sign of
<br>
convergence?  Any saturation? Any deceleration?  In emprirical fact,
<br>
isn't what we see in a mere hundred years an unstopably exponential
<br>
avalanche of proliferation of creative subtleties?
<br>
<br>
     Isn't the most obvious outcome for the next century a continuation
<br>
of this inexhaustibly creative weaving of this coat of many colors,
<br>
worlds within worlds, without end, without any possible end, not in a
<br>
hundred billion years of sentient evolution, not ever, forever?  Isn't
<br>
this, ahem, trend, amen,  the primary observational fact of the whole
<br>
hundred years?
<br>
<br>
     I say so.  I hereby dignify this empirical law by a suitable
<br>
appellation:
<br>
<br>
     Murrray's Law:  In the overall exponential evolution of the
<br>
scientific process, the scale of reality available for consideration
<br>
and the diversity and sublety of its entities and interactions all
<br>
increase exponentially, forever.
<br>
<br>
     In 1660, the linear grid of Cartesian coordinates comprised the
<br>
primary paradigm for scientific reality.  On its empty black and white
<br>
board Newton drew alike the falling apple, the orbiting Moon.  Now the
<br>
archetypal image is the Mandlebrot Set, brilliantly and arbitrarily
<br>
colored, forever inexhaustible in timeless infinity of subtle detail.

<br>
? ? ?
<br>
<br>
I question why this is even a question.
<br>
<br>
We see in hindsight, marveling at our existence, thinking that there was a "plan" for it, even in the absence of a planner. . . .
<br>
<br>
. . . as if human presence somehow must have been "anticipated" by the universe.
<br>
<br>
Why not just believe that we are here as part of the universe?  We are no more (and certainly NO LESS) important than a rock or a cloud.  We merely are a higher-order complexity of the same "stuff".
<br>
<br>
Why should it be such a surprise that as part of the universe's being, we simply ARE the universe seeing itself locally?
<br>
<br>
I already accept that everything in the universe is "mixed from the same batter".  Why is it so incredible, really, that the "batter" can achieve a level of order that recognizes itself as "living"?
<br>
<br>
Such redrodictive pondering in amazement somehow denies a basic tenent that we are exactly what we are - UNIVERSE.
<br>
<br>
The amazement, I think, comes from the slowness with which that realization is setting in.

<br>
You can't change the force constants a little bit and still produce life of any kind, becauses all of the anthropic coincidences are balanced between opposing runaway tendencies.
<br>
<br>
For example, the unexplained near-perfect "flatness" of the expanding universe.  Any sustained deviation in the rate of expansion would rapidly accumulate to cause the universe to race so far away from your wildest dreams for what constitutes life, that it would make your head swim.
<br>
<br>
The runaway greenhouse effect is another example of this, as counterbalanced by the long-term tendency toward glaciation that is predicted by milankovitch models, there is a cumulative runaway effect that is inhererent to all valid anthropic coincidences.

<br>
<br>
I assume that your response located underneath my previous post was directed at me (Robert K.)
<br>
<br>
Assuming this is the case, you are caught up in the very amazement about life that I speak of.  And being amazed about life is NOT the issue.  It's the WHY of being amazed.  
<br>
<br>
My statement does not show ignorance; it shows deeper awareness than those who use retrodictive evidence seem to understand.
<br>
<br>
You cannot say "universe favors life",..... until AFTER you emerge to see this life that IS universe.  What's so amazing about being exactly as things worked out?  The amazing thing is that we are a product of how things worked out.
<br>
<br>
Universe need not have "known of us" in order to work out this way.  Had it not worked out this way, we would not be here to notice one way or the other.
<br>
<br>
This does not mean we are accidents.  There are no accidents, really.  There are just best ways of emergence, given the conditions.  One set of conditions leads to one emergence.  Another set of conditions leads to another emergence.  A particular working out of emergence does not mean that it was somehow "known about" in the fabric of the universe.  
<br>
<br>
Hydrogen - first most abundant element in known universe.
<br>
<br>
Oxygen - third most abundant element in known universe.
<br>
<br>
Water - mixture of hydrogen and oxgen - prime foundation of life as we know it.
<br>
<br>
Hydrogen, oxygen - initial conditions leading to water planet, leading to life.  That's the way it worked out.  We are a product of this unique initial condition of abundance of these vibrations/atoms.
<br>
<br>
Yes, it's amazing and wonderful that we can be conscious to see this.  But, no, it is not amazing that the universe "anticipated" us.
<br>
We are the universe of THOSE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS.
<br>
<br>
You cannot make bread out of sand.  But does this mean that flour is somehow more amazing than sand?  Just think: if the molecular structure of the fine constituents of bread had been just slightly off, then we would not be tasting bread but dirt.  Therefore, the universe must have anticipated our making bread instead of concrete. 
<br>
<br>
Maybe this is a bad analogy, but I can't find the words yet to adequately nail my resolution and felt disposition.
<br>
<br>

I'm not really sure how to fit this to your reply, but a "higher-order complexity of the same stuff"...  indicates a preferential hierarchy of the ordering of *some* of "the same stuff".
<br>
<br>
That is to say that we may be here for some specially required and necessary physical reason, which was indeed instilled at the beginning of time, but for a purpose.
<br>
<br>
Human presence could have been "anticipated" from the beginning within the physical *need* for it, if we are needed by the physics to perform some special function in the thermodynamic process of a nearly-static yet barely expanding universe.  The anthropic principle is the only answer that science has for this cosmological constant problem, so the indication is that we ARE the mechanism that enables this condition.
<br>
<br>
So the AP is telling us that we should look for something that we do extremely efficiently that makes this possible.

Consonance or resonance need not require preference for such.  That's just a fundamental initial character of universe, on which our emergence rests.

I guess I'm uncovering a bias in myself to think that a simple dynamic is just as important as a simple substrate.  The dynamic is just as much a given as the substrate upon which it acts.

The connection that you're looking for is just thermodynamics, so it's no coincidence that an anthropic constraint on the forces indicates that there is a mechanism that enables the universe to (((convolve))) characteristics forward to higher orders of the same basic structure, as well.

Not so much "planed for" as it is an inevitable consequence of the need for it.  This is proven by General Relativity without quantum weirdness when GR is applied to the natural evolution of the initial conditions, per the arrow of time.

The thing that you can't avoid though, (without willful ignorance), is that anthropic bias is absolutely necessary and warrented in an anthropically constrained universe, for good reason.

<br>
Which I don't necessarily disagree with, but my point is that there is an unavoidably inherent prediction that an anthropic constraint on the forces of the universe will necessarily include a mechanism which enables the universe to carry its traits or characteristics forward in the exact same manner that we did when when lept from apes.
<br>
<br>
Such a mechanism would make the TOE the ToE, because, in this context, evolutionary theory explains *why* the forces cannot be unified... since they never were.

<br>
Does the universe have a goal, or not... is the question.  The answer is, yes, absloute symmetry, but this is unattainable, because asymmetry is inherent, so it's all about the journey, not arriving.
<br>
<br>
The big bang produced a near-perfectly super-symmetrical balance between matter and antimatter, but not quite!  
<br>
<br>
See: "Supersymmetry theory"... and then understand why what I just said is highly relevant.
<br>
<br>
Expansion is another way for the imbalanced universe to achieve symmetery, notice that this effort does not stop.
<br>
<br>
Don't assume that this predominant effort can stop, and the only conclusion that you can draw is that it must leap/bang to a higher order of the same exact process.
<br>
<br>
So the next universe will be just a tiny bit "flatter", (more symmetrical), and it probably won't include life, but it will include a mechanism that does the same thing that we do to the symmetry of this universe when we make matter/antimatter pairs from vacuum energy.
<br>
<br>
We are, **cumulatively** (don't assume that we're alone in this, because that isn't what is indicated by extension of the principle to other galaxies LIKE OURS, time-wise in the history of the universe), the cause for the universal scale evolutionary effect which the evolutionary extension predicts will eventually lead to a big bang, and relativity theory exposes the mechanism for how this is possible when applied in the manner that I previously stated.

We (humans) are the universe "seeing itself" for what it is.  This does not require our local minds reflecting on the how of this resonance, which amounts to us speaking of mathematical constants.  Such mannar of speaking is an expression locally of underlying truths that far exceed those comprehension schemes characterized by our talk of numbers, constants, etc.

The universe would have arrived at us, whether we spoke in these terms or not.  The universe "claims us" by other means.

The key idea is "signal nonlocality," which may be essential to all life and which allows us to see the other universes in the cosmic landscape outside of our horizons. That is, information from the future is possible. That's the good news. The bad news is the orthodox quantum theory is violated as is the no-cloning theorem - the cornerstone of quantum computer theory. Antony Valentini now at The Perimeter Institute has discussed this issue of "signal nonlocality". </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Jack,
<br>
<br>
Is it even possible to summarize the main points of your very technical paper in less-technical language?
<br>
<br>
I know that you are probably too busy to wade through it and do yet another treatement of it, but (if by chance) you have it in you, then (of course) I would find it very helpful.
<br>
<br>
Even at my level of understanding, the paper seems to find places of resonance in me.
<br>
<br>
I noticed that you spoke of a two-fluid model actually being a three-fluid model.  Maybe you might start here by clearly indicating how you mean this.
<br>
<br>
What aspects, for example, of your treatment correspond to one fluid?, two fluids?, three fluids?  And how, in general, can math be reoriented towards embedded fluid-conceptual modes, when dealing with cosmological ideas (computationally-friendly or otherwise).
<br>
<br>
I tend to be "otherwise".

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Popularizing well is difficult of course. I try to do it in the 2nd edition of my book Super Cosmos that I think is now on Amazon? If you get it, contact Authorhouse first and make sure it's the 2nd edition. I am trying again in "Star Gate" to make the ideas more accessible. Here is a blurb for Asilomar Conference on Time July 2007
<br>
<br>
Theme: Consciousness, Cosmology, and Gravity
<br>
<br>
The possible connection between these three ideas has been suggested by Sir Roger Penrose in his series of semi-popular books. What do all three ideas have in common? John Archibald Wheeler speaks of IT FROM BIT in which the material world emerges from what Sir James Jeans called "mind stuff." Olaf Stapledon's "Star Maker", P.K. Dick's VALIS and Gene Roddenberry's "Q" in Star Trek resonate with this possible enigmatic mind-matter connection. The boundary between fact and fiction is not as sharp as it once was. Time travel to the past is now the subject of papers in the Physical Review. The cosmic dark energy, though only 10^-30 density of water is 73% of the the stuff of our pocket universe in the "Cosmic Landscape." What is the "dark matter" that is 23%? Are they both simply forms of quantum vacuum zero point energy of negative and positive pressure respectively. Can the dark energy be amplified on a small scale to make traversable wormhole time travel machines to the past that evade Hawking's "chronology protection"? Is consciousness some kind of physical field that can couple strongly to the fabric of space-time itself? Michio Kaku calls this a "Type IV" super-civilization. George Chapline and Robert Laughlin suggest gravity as an emergent macro-quantum vacuum coherent phenomenon analogous to a superfluid. I have published a different detailed model of that as well on the Cornell Archive. That the conscious mind is also a macro-quantum coherent field like a superfluid with holographic properties is also now a common idea. Is the common factor macro-quantum coherence? Can the coherent phases that may make the fabric of curved spacetime be locked to the coherent phases of a machine or even a living mind? One of the basic properties of quantum information/computer theory is the "no perfect cloning a quantum" theorem that forbids the sending of signals through the particle and event horizons of cosmology and black hole physics. This implies that string theory's "Cosmic Landscape" of parallel universes is unscientific. This is David Gross's lament in a recent Nature. However, experiments by Dick Bierman and others suggest "signal nonlocality" in living matter. The theory of "signal nonlocality" has been developed by Antony Valentini. It violates micro-quantum theory, but not the macro-quantum theory of emergent phenomena that may include consciousness, cosmology and gravity. This would then, perhaps, give us Hawking's "Mind of God", the Vast Active Living Intelligence of perhaps a "spin foam" cosmic computer, with the Megaverse as a "simulation" in The Matrix of M-Theory?
<br>
<br>
3-fluid model
<br>
This is joint work with Robert Becker.
<br>
Landau 2-fluid model has superfluid-normal fluid.
<br>
Superfluid is 100% at absolute zero and 0% at phase transition. 
<br>
However, the problem is that at absolute zero the Bose-Einstein condensate is only maybe a tenth of the total density. The rest is locally random zero point fluctuation. I proposed that this zero point fluctuation in the motiion of helium atoms, for example, though locally random, is nonlocally coherent is nonlocally phase coherent in the sense of Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky entanglement. This would be the 3rd fluid explaining how the phenomenological superfluid density is actually the sum of the Bose-Einstein condensate density + the nonlocally coherent zero point density. The coherence is in the momentum ordering not the posiition ordering. The momentum is nonlocal by Heisenberg's uncertainty so that there is local random position uncertainty compatible with nonlocal momentum coherence. This is all inside the "ground state" (vacuum). Normal fluid is elementary excitations outside of the ground state.
<br>
<br>
Note in an entangled photon pair in say Aspect's famous Paris experiment, each photon is locally randomly unpolarized in an incoherent mixed state even though the pair as a whole is in a coherent pure state. That's the key idea generalized from spin ordering to momentum ordering.
<br>
<br>
Now in cosmology and emergent gravity we have something very similar where the anti-gravitating dark energy is locally incoherent but nonlocally coherent. The key geometrodynamic field is called the Cartan tetrad field and, in my theory, it emerges from the modulation of the holographic coherent "Goldstone phases" of the vacuum inflation field in a way similar to how the superflow velocity field emerges from a single Goldstone phase in simple Helium II. 
<br>
<br>
PW Anderson calls this theory of emergence "More is different" in condensed matter physics. Sidney Colman calls it "hidden" or "secret" symmetry in particle physics. Roger Penrose discusses it as "spontaneous symmetry breaking" in "The Road to Reality." Ch. 28 Another good book is Robert Laughlin's "A Different Universe."</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Thanks Jack.
<br>
<br>
You are soooooo out of my league with regard to formal disciplinary training, but that doesn't really scare me, especially since I STILL seem to find what you have to offer somehow sinking in..... via a sort of "stupid radar" (for lack of a more eloquent phrase).  (^____^)
<br>
<br>
I just finished a very short paper trying to reconcile one of my approaches to painting with the concept of fluidity in all human history.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, in my mesely little research, I came across the idea of an ancient twin-water creation myth in Assyro-Babylonian culture.
<br>
<br>
I find it interesting that I seem to be seeing some recurrance of this idea in the modern guise of mathematical physics.  But instead of twin waters, we're talking about some other sort of fluids or fluid-like conceptualization scheme.
<br>
<br>
God forbid the term "aether" or the phrase "fluid aether" be used!  But something fluid-like seems to be going on.  We (historically) have ventured away from the solid aether of old, to the confusing Einsteinian manifold (medium-well-maybe-not-a-medium?), to "the fabric of space/time", to strings and branes, to quantum foam, to zero-point energy field, to spin networks, to spin foams, to loop quantum what-the-heck-who-knows-what-it-all-is.
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that human beings REQUIRE calling reality by a name and identifying that name with a local metaphor, in order to generate, share and build on a common understanding.
<br>
<br>
THAT's why fluid models appeal to me.  They seem to beckon to something very basic in our MANNER OF UNDERSTANDING.
<br>
<br>
Even if we admit that it is only a MANNER OF UNDERSTANDING, a fluid model seems to be a best metaphorical mannar of creating that understanding.  If a mathematical approach can support it, then even better!
<br>
<br>
Joel Morrison is very in tune to this fluid thing too, as you might have observed in his postings here under the guise of his screen name... (HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, JOEL,...... breaking your incognito, in the name of understanding here). 
<br>
<br>
Anyway,.... interesting statistics you noted:
<br>
<br>
* "dark energy" = 10^-30 density of water, 73% of stuff of our pocket of the universe
<br>
<br>
*  "dark matter" = 23% of stuff of our ... universe
<br>
<br>
We have these mysterious names for what we're supposed to be made of.  It's almost as if we are not willing to say that we are anything.  
<br>
<br>
Copenhagen has ruined us!
