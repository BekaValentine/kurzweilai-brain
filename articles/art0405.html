<p>If you could design your own body--give it any shape, size, color, contour, texture <i>and</i> elegant design--what would you choose?</p>
<p>What if your body could regenerate healthier, fresher skin <i>and</i> substitute worn out tendons, ligaments and joints with replaceable ones? What if your body was as sleek, as sexy, <i>and</i> felt as comfortable as your new automobile? These are just a few of the questions to consider in the decades ahead.<br>

</p><h1>Primo 3M+ 2002 -- More comfort, better performance, lower price.</h1><p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> of Primo's physique is designed for mobility, flexibility and longevity. Primo is being considered for the 2002 Smithsonian Summary/Fall Design Exposition.</p>
<p>We like to think of it as a cross between Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Valentine. The collaborative scientific team that designed Primo includes <a class="thought" href="entries/more_entry.html">Max More</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/minsky_entry.html">Marvin Minsky</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a>, Michael Rose, Greg Fahy, Ralph Merkle, Alexander Sasha Chislenko, Roy Walford, Gregory Benford, Robin Hanson, <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/moravec_entry.html">Hans Moravec</a>.</p>
<p>Primo's radical body design is more powerful, better suspended and more flexible--its body offering extended performance and modern style. The expansive interior provides advanced metabrain and enhanced senses. Our nano-engineered spinal <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> runs under the guidance of networked <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> with a wide range of optional features.</p>

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> nose protects and warns owner of potential danger as well as adds to visual replay recognition via smell association.</p>
<p>A multi-disciplinary approach by CalTech to design an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> nose spans <a class="thought" href="entries/neurobiology_entry.html">neurobiology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> engineering. The goal is to develop construction of a <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> "nose on a chip."</p>
<p>"The olfactory receptors are proteins that  sit on the surface of your nerve cells, in the upper reaches of your nasal cavity." (Digsents)</p>
<p>The molecules entering your nose bind sense these proteins, triggering a cascade of events. As a result, signals are transmitted to your brain, where we <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> smell.</p>
<p>Experts say that humans (and early transhumans) smell anywhere from 3000-4000 to 10,000-30,000 smells. According to neuroscientist Dr. Stuart Firestein, we can "detect and discriminate between 10,000 different chemicals which we commonly call 'odors.' This is probably the most sophisticated chemical detector that we know of."</p>
<p>"Smells and scents elicit very strong messages to human sensory networks. They can evoke vivid memories that have long been buried in our subconscious. The sense of smell is often the first sense alerted to danger or even slight changes in the environment." (Ruef)</p>
<p>As <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> became more complex, creatures continued to use their sense of smell to find food and water, evade predators, track prey, and recognize and attract mates.</p><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a></h2><p>In 600 BC, nasal reconstruction was done by using a forehead flap over a nasal defect. (Samhita Sushruta, India).</p>
<p>Much later, in the late 1800s, improvements  in anesthesia techniques encouraged  surgeons to augment the nose with such materials as paraffin, gold, silver, aluminum, platinum, porcelain, celluloid, ivory, cork  and some stones from the Black Sea.</p>

I think that Natasha did allude to designer genes, which would encompass designer proteins, and the optical augmentation suggests an array of visual enhancements that would both protect the entity and offer a wider range of imaging contexts.

<br>
<br>
It seems to me that many of our peers invest their talents in the hardware and not enough imaginative idea-spinning on how vastly important aesthetics are on culture.  From my research, I have learned that a large portion of society is frightened by the pending dominance of SI and mass technologies which appear angular, unfamiliar and demanding.  Impressionism is a welcomed alternative to a bushel of overt realism.

I designed "Primo" to be nonsexual so that a buyer could design his, her or its style.  I used my own body for the point and click because as a soft-content visual because of the very fact that audiences are tired of the cyborgish metallic/robotic look.

Hahaha!  -:)  Well this is a Conceptual Art piece in the genre of  Extropic net.art.  Regardless, if you stay around for some years to come (vis-a-vis Ray Kurzweil's estimations) you just might be able to afford an assembly of models.
<br>
<br>
Seriously, with more and more innovative emphasis placed on designer robotic limbs, implants and all sorts of add-ons available to use today, I wouldn't be surprised at all if we do have replaceable bodies on the other side of the Surge.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Natasha,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the work you've done here with Primo.  It truly is amazing when we consider that these things that we joke about now, will in all eventuality come into existence within our or our children's lifetimes.  With the work already under way on neural mapping, single particle scanning, and other passive scanning technologies a future when it will be possible to upload our minds to some sort of new medium becomes closer every day.  
<br>
<br>
In many ways it is a future that many people are afraid of and unprepared for.  Humans do not like change except in small predictable ways (yes I know many people do enjoy change but I am speaking in broad species terms.)  The thought of a future where humanity has left the track of biological evolution and transformed itself into a technologically evolving species is a change of unprecedented proportion which many people will not be able to cope with.  
<br>
<br>
At some point in our future humanity will approach a junction of possibility.  On one branch we shall have continued biological existence.  On the other a completely new form of life based on advanced technology.  Some shall choose continued biological existence; others shall explore the unknown.  My hope is that when this occurs we shall find a way for both species of humanity to continue to peacefully co-exist.  
<br>
<br>
However in this it is likely that any fears we may have will likely be predictive in that as a species we have throughout history shown that much smaller differences than biological/ non biological have been used as just cause for discrimination, war, and other forms of intercommunity discord.
<br>
<br>
At this point it is impossible to predict the exact forms that shall come into existence in relation to the future evolution of our species but I look forward to the adventure.  We live in amazing times.
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This technology is all great, but do we really want to live forever? I have to admit, the idea has some appeal to me, particularly since a state of nonexistence is, I think, inconceiveable for any being that's only ever aware of existence. Death is the absolute end of everything that we have ever known, and no matter how advanced we become, we can never master nonexistence. We can avoid it, probably indefinitely, but no matter what body I have, no matter what computer my mind inhabites, I'm still mortal. I'm still capable of dying with my material body, so regardless of what technology we have sort of some kind of immaterial existence, there can be no immortality.
<br>
 But I digress. My original question was whether or not we WANT to live forever, not if we can actually do it. I'm not sure if I would want to or not. As I said, the prospect has a certain appeal. I think the reasoning for most people is this: if we could live forever, then we would have all the time to do whatever we want and never grow old and suffer. This would be true, assuming that the universe is inifinite. It would have to be, otherwise, given an inifnite amount of time, we'd exhaust all the potential activities we could do an inifinite number of times over. I wouldn't bank on the universe being infinite, though, because at our current level of knowledge, it could be just about any size. Between any given number and inifinity are an inifinite number of sizes, if one of those numbers is inifinity and there's equal probability of each one being true, then the odds of the universe being infinitely large are literally one in inifinity against. Even if it was, it may just be a whole lot of empty real estate or the nature of the universe may confine us to what we can currently observe. But who knows, maybe physics will impress us yet. 
<br>
  Besides what we'll actually do with all our free time, immortality will irreperably change the very nature of humanity. I believe that the reason why we are able to make value judgements, be they subjective or moral, is because we know that we suffer and die. In trying to assign some kind of meaning to our seemingly pointless lives, we ask all sorts of questions and make decisions about virtue, justice, good and evil, and other ideals to give our lives paramaters by which to live in our search for meaning. Perhaps we all just want happiness in the limited time we have. Either way, immortality may change all that. Immortals want happiness, too, but I think they may get bored after a little taste of infinity. I forget who it was who said "Hell is spending an eternity locked in a room with all your best friends." My point is that most people want immortality to live extraordinary lives, and I think it takes a mortal to appreciate the simpler pleasures. 
<br>
  Anyway, in light of this, I think I'll keep my mortality. It might be nice to live longer, maybe even a few hundred years, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Besides, in the cosmic scheme of the universe, it really doesn't matter what happens to me. My death or my immortality can only ever effect humanity.</p></td>

An "environmentally intelligent" body would be one that is both intelligent about it's internal environment and also the world outside itself. One of the most brazenly messy environments today is the emotional environment of communication.  There seems to be a shortage of mental fluidity in thinking patterns, i.e., critical thinking, as well as the cognitive process of communicative understanding amongst people.

<br>
I didn't say "destroyed."  That is your word.  I said, "trashed" and I was refering to a trend that has not abated but is growing and is making the air unbreathable, the water undrinkable and our waste productsd (industrial as well as personal) are cover more of the earth each day.  Many species of fish and animals are disappearing from the planet and will never return.  The global warming we are causing will soon make many plants that are temperature sensitive disappear until they can repropagate in zones more to their liking.  These are all examples of trashing the planet.  The beaches in San Diego, where I live, are shut down an ever larger portion of each year due to pollution and high bacteria counts.  
<br>
<br>
We don't have to "destroy" the planet to make it uninhabitable.  We just need to change it enough that it can't sustain us any longer.  When we plant most of the acrage on earth with the same few plants we need to feed our growing population, it will only take one or two scourges like the one that destroyed the potato crop in Ireland in the 1800s or the hoof-and-mouth disease that caused the British to kill hundreds of thousands of cattle, or the bird flu that devastated the chickens in Hong Kong to make life on earth more like hell than heaven.  Let any of these diseases evolve and spread on a global scale (carried on the feet of travelers or the wings of birds or in the satchels of terrorists) and the planet will have been trashed enough to hurt us and make life miserable.

My error. Thanks for the clarification and explanation. I didn't intend to twist your words out of context. I was taught to respect my elders, and I come here in peace.  I thought for a second you were heading down a different path, and it kinda took me by surprise, as if you had tossed in the towel on humanity.  
<br>
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
<br>
In considering the the scenerios you illustrate above, it is predictable that next millenium is going to be anything but boring, and I don't envision  humankind will ever  have too much of a good thing.  With the advances we have made this far have come increasing complexity. With every new technology we develop come new questions and more problems.  In my mind, that is the good news.  If I were to sit around on a cloud plucking my harp day after day, that to me would be worse than hell.  There has never been, and never will be, any shortage of opportunity to produce every increasing values and infinite happiness.
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
I recall a story told by my father of a man who died and woke up in the most beautiful place you could imagine.  He was met by a man who provided his every wish.  He asked for a bottle of wine, and was brought the finest.  He asked for a mansion and was given the most exquisit palace one could imagine with the finest accessories, swimming pools, and a driveway paved with gold.  He was surrounded by the most beautiful women he had ever seen.  Everything he requested was provided for him. He never had to lift a finger.  
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
On one particular day his host noticed that the man seemed to be bored and unhappy, and asked the man what it was that he wanted.  After thinking for a moment, the man replied; \"This is worse than hell!\"  His is host replied;  \"Where do you think you are?\"
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
San Diego is not that far from Salt Lake, but I have only been there on several occasions.  That was about 18 years ago.  A beautiful place as I remember, and sad to hear it is getting trashed.  
<br>
&lt;br&gt;
<br>
If I we can turn back your biological clock about 50 years and clean up the beach, would you consider sticking around for another couple hundred years?  We could have big parties, and it would get us chicks!

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>With regards to "turning back the biological clock..."
<br>
<br>
With our growing understanding of retroviruses and the human genome, could it be possible to engineer viral vectors that specifically replace the genes assosciated with aging with other nucleotide sequences, even in adult organisms? (Viral DNA already constitutes a significant portion of the human genome, demonstrating the viability of these types of vectors.) We already have a solid understanding of what causes aging in many species, including humans - if ALL genetic factors involved in programmed cell death were removed, even complex organisms should be able to continue repairing themselves, much like bacterial cell lines, which seem to have unlimited longevity.
<br>
<br>
Understandably, there would be many hurdles in the path of this technology, including initial immune rejection and the need for very careful "rewrites" of the perhaps polycistronic aging sequences. Hopefully, computer technology will continue to advance so that we may have accurate models for approximating the effects of our changes on the nucleotide sequences.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, we would have to exert very precise control over the behavior of such a virus - perhaps finding a way to discourage any type of lytic activity. (We could utilize non-lytic viruses so that they do not damage the infected cells, then clone trillions of copies in vitro for each treatment, letting the blood stream disperse them.)
<br>
<br>
I'm only a high school student, so my understanding is limited...if you have more background in this area, please enlighten me. I'm very interested in what all of you think - do you consider it plausible?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>

The retrovirus is an excellent model for medical technology of the future. Can you further elaborate?
<br>
<br>
With so many design considerations already invested in your idea what keeps you from synthesizing this to completion?
<br>
<br>
This idea of creating such a precise medical tool, as to render current technology vulgar, is the theme of nanotechnology. I assume someone of your knowledge base has already collected a wealth of information.
<br>
<br>
It is obvious that you have learned much from your schooling. I wish that when I was in high-school I myself may have extrapolated so much.

<br>
<br>
White blood cells recognise significantly changed DNA as cancer
<br>
<br>
If you can change the white blood cells appropriately, how do you modify the white blood cells to carry _two_ sets of genes, one 'old', one 'new', and recognise oth as good
<br>
<br>
What about cells who are in the process of changine?
<br>
<br>
If you do this all at once, you must have different RNA for _every body part, as it's the RNA, as I understand, that picks which genes to duplicate and make say, skin cells, or type 2 muscle cells. This is considerably a higher challenge than modifying just one set, at the beginning.
<br>
<br>
Your proposed soup of viruses would immediately send the modify-ee's immune system into an uproar, and kill them with shock.
<br>
<br>
With much more advanced medecine, and an ability to somehow temporarily, completely suppress the immune system, it may be possible.

Plus there's no reason for us to be contained here on earth anyway.  There is no problem that can't be solved with intelligence.

<br>
Let's relegate Edvard Ludd and his followers, and the new left's fascists to the scrap heap of bad ideas.  They're the only ones who could even slow down the progress enough to make it dirty and unpleasant, even for a short time.  Without their obstacles to free trade we'd already be living in a nanotech paradise.

Not that I'd want to, and I don't know many people who would.

Anyway, I think we really should focus more on fixing some of our current problems. We still have poverty, pollution, warfare, and social disparity...I think or obligation is toward improving the quality of life before we try to lengthen it. And when I say life, I don't just mean the life of the individual. We need to stabilize and improve the condition of our civilization before we try to lengthen or own lifetimes. After all, living for a really long time would be kind of pointless if the world you live in is miserable.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;My original question was whether or not we WANT to live forever, not if we can actually do it. I'm not sure if I would want to or not. As I said, the prospect has a certain appeal. I think the reasoning for most people is this: if we could live forever, then we would have all the time to do whatever we want and never grow old and suffer. &lt;
<br>
<br>
The concept of superlongevity is becoming grass roots.  If not through the recent watershed advances in medicine and biotechnologies, than certainly through the media-rich periodicals that put words like 'immortality' on the cover of Time, Newsweek, etc.  We will do it, but not by single-tracking the cultural and economic landscape.
<br>
<br>
Here are some possibilities on the front end:  (1) life extension enhancing the 'quality' of life for those living with the full extend of the current life span; (2) biotechnology determining which genes turn on and off aging; (4) genetic engineering successfully eliminating certain life threatening diseases; (3) replaceable body parts prolonging life past biological capabilities; (4) cryonics ability to revive suspended patients; (4) nanomedicine integrating successfully with biology.  Once we live past what has been considered to be our life span, living to 200 or 500 will be inconsequential.  Further out, the face of time will change.
<br>
<br>
Certainly, those who do not desire a longer life would not be pushed to live longer, although a person could feel a certain peer pressure into living hundreds of years.  A person might want to worship a particular belief system that supports death.  No one should be coerced to live longer than he or she chooses.  
<br>
<br>
An important factor is to preserve human compassion and freedom of choice.

In the future with procesors getting faster and faster we could live a liftime in a virtual type world in only a week. Can you imagine picking the kind of life you would like to try next, just let your imagination fly. It could be as real as this life with great passion and experience. You could be put into a machine that keeps your body safe while you go to your next life. When you are awakend you might need to work for a week with duties keeping the robots and computers working while you decide what your next life will be. You could live 50-100 liftimes and still leave room for future generations to have their life.  Sometimes I have thought that this world is just that, a place constructed to help us excape from eternity but that makes no sense as you would need something to originate from. Also why the vast construction of this huge, huge universe. Oh those are questions we can't answer yet.

You obviously haven't seen me in awhile.  Ask Mr. Pizer about the success of my diet.  In late 2000 I weighed 285 lbs.  This morning I weighed 219.  I've been adhering to an approximate hunter-gatherer diet because high-glycemic agricultural foods like grains, potatoes, beans, processed sugars and milk compromise my metabolism.  Lean meats, canned salmon, the yolk-free eggwhite stuff you buy in cartons, fresh fruits &amp; vegetables, black and green tea (sweetened with NutraSweet), and nuts like sunflower seeds and walnuts have sustained me for the past fourteen months or so.  I find this diet quite agreeable.

<br>
<br>
The New York Museum of Modern Art is missing the entire net.art movement instead of visiting KurzweilAI to see inspiring work like Natasha's 'Primo'.  I heard about 'Primo' in a recent discussion at Rhizome about Vanessa Beecroft's exhibiton at the MOMA.  Boring.  Primo puts MOMA to shame!!  It seems to me that the scope of Guerilla Girls actions was suppose to be something like Transhumanist Arts but didn't have the brainpower.  Beecroft shows the downside of the human body and inner ulginess.  Natasha shows the beauty of the body in all its abilities. Sure, it's form is attractive, but it's more than that.  It functions.  Gives new meaning to architecture.

Be real! Only the uploading may prevent primo to become dominant. Why? Because one move of the primo would consume as much energy as a billion of years of an uploaded primo. Doing the same and some more.

My another (quite radical) assumption is, that uploads will essentially be - "primo like".

Geeez.  I wonder if the person who needs to have a replacement organ is worried about the cost or if he gets the part because he needs it.
<br>
<br>
If you want to know the cost of Primo, just figure that the few years the upgrades will be expensive and only those who can afford it will purchase it. When more people want it, just like the sewing machine, telephone, television, and computer, the price will drop. 
<br>
<br>
Is there an artist in the crowd?

"What has this got to do with art? I wonder if anyone said to Warhol - Won't your painting of a can of soup give me lead poisoning if I look at your painting? ' Hey aa Vinci don't imagine too much your ideas might cost too much! -"
<br>
<br>
I think that it is necessary to discuss the social landscape in deliberations about art. Art, by its very nature, causes emotional responses. 
<br>
<br>
If you read through the posts on this list, you will note individuals who are inspired by ideas and others who have an ax to grind.  In the artworld, even  negative responses are a sign that the work did hit a nerve and those who take the time to express their angst are encountering their own limitations. Their expressions of anger, fear, annoyance and frustration are somehow moved.  They might not like that they are moved, or even appreciate that they are moved.
<br>
<br>
Now, if you would like to know how "Primo" fits into the scheme of things in the art world and in society, multi-track the relationship between arts and society. The purpose of the arts has been to communicate.  Artists are communicators.  We communicate ideas developed and arranged from individual insight about world around us.  The way we communicate ideas is expressed in whichever art form or style (context) we choose and which we think best reflects or expresses the content.
<br>
<br>
Today, in the early 21st century, the most immediate, the most noteworthy, the most fascinating issues and circumstances are the evolution of the human in its merging with machines and the implications of AI and SI, biotechnology, superlongevity, etc.  These issues become the core values, the themes, of Art.  "Primo" as Michael Rose says, is at the center of the next massive ideological shift in society.  
<br>
<br>
Art isn't just about depicting beauty in life, it is about expressing ideas.  Art is a barometer of society and culture.

&gt;right. especially to someone in the paktia province.&lt;
<br>
<br>
The fighting in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktia is a tragic situation.  Let me quote a journalist:  "The contradictory stories told about the fighting in Gardez show the obstacles the coalition forces face in trying to decipher what is happening on the ground and why. The inclination to label one's opponents further underscores the difficulties in gathering good intelligence."
<br>
<br>
To put this metaphorically, those who are counter productive to transhumanist technologies are at a major disadvantage.  You may scoff and stammer about how transhumanity is a useless waste of time, but it is transhumanity's intelligence which will make the world a better place to live.  Without the technologies which can cure disease, help the poor and suffering, clean up the e toxic environment, resolve energy problems and help those with mental and emotional suffering, humanity cannot go forward and resolve any struggle ' including, but not limited to, war.
<br>
<br>
Your implications are counteractive to progress - the progress which is needed in territories such as Paktia and elsewhere in the world. Rather than labeling your opponents, it might be more fruitful to gather good intelligence.

<br>
There is a misconception that positive ideas and pro-active possibilities are expensive and only availabe to the elite. 
<br>
<br>
If you think that only a few can afford to life a healthier and longer life, you are mistaken. History has repeated shown that when a product hits the mainstream, its cost and therefore its price goes down considerably.  Take the television, telephone and computer, for example.  These three examples were at one time expensive and only available as luxury items.  Today, these items are owned and used by the masses.
<br>
<br>
&gt;i'm not opposed to technology. quite contrary. but let's not confuse vain notions of immortality with useful technology, unless primo also provides clean drinking water.&lt;
<br>
<br>
The concept of "immortality" does ring of a vain notion - a fairy tale.  "Superlongevity" is an obtainable goal.  Our bodies today are moderately enhanced with basic technological upgrades, from the filings in our teeth to contacts for our eyes.  These enhancements will become more advanced as technology is designed with the intent to improve, extend and save lives.  Biotechnology will be the most useful application of technology in the spirit and the fortitude of invention because the medical applications of technology in saving lives.

<br>
<br>
Yes, agreed.  Evolution is about adapting to the environment. From the Australopithecus to the Human our ancestors have adapted and evolved.  Transhumanism is about moving beyond human limits not abandoning them. I'm not sure I follow your "sacred" reference.  Unless you are involved in religious belief systems, individuality is certainly the most essential and important aspect of being alive. For those who have religious beliefs and long for life after death and/or welcome a supernatural reality, I can certainly understand. This would make sense as to why you would be dubious or opposed to investing to human technological augmentation and why it would seem superfluous.
<br>
<br>
For those of us who love living life and welcome its challenges, being around for decades past the recognized human lifespan is a preferred option.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Great comments!
<br>
<br>
Let me explain how Primo does run on parallel and which metabrain has a 24-hour communications assist:
<br>
<br>
If you take a look at the metabrain's communication grid, you will notice that Primo's 24 hour communications AI network links it's primary brain to any one of a number of sub-personalities.  These sub-personalities could easily work together filtering information from the main brain (or metabrain) to the alternative brain networks.  Rather than cloning, per se, it seems more likely that uploading (or Uploads) brain functioning into any one of an unlimited of structures would work nicely.  These structures could exist in real time or simulated realities (on a very basic level, like you on real time and your computer performing tasks for you).
<br>
<br>
&gt;Imagine have duplicates of yourself across the globe, all acting under one mind?&lt;
<br>
<br>
Yes!  It would certainly make life a bit more available for the many interests and activities we have or would like to have, would it? -:)
<br>
<br>
&gt;Not sure if the human mind will be able to achieve the dynamics required to manage that, but the possibility exists at least at lower levels.&lt;
<br>
<br>
Not the human mind, but certainly the post-biological, late transhuman or posthuman mind.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your input!

A problem can not be solved at the level at which it is asked, I believe Einstein declared.  So even as I am knocked back on my heels (aka ignorance,fear, anxiety, excitement, happiness)when confronted with new technologies, I am still open to imaginings that become realities for a common good.   A Primo body could be the solution for a Primo world. I say, "Why not?"  Another says, "No Way!"  No Way offers no way.  Primo offers some way.  A positive human response is an evolution to "Primo " and I salute it.

Some of the enhancements to the senses that she proposes are, however, flawed. For example, having multiple threads of consciousness. First of all, you'd need to completely rewire the human brain to achieve that. I assume that she's suggesting to 'unify' threads of inputs under a common conscious processing of course, because completely separated experiential threads would only result in different people living in the same head and that's even sillier as an idea. But consider the simple aesthetic change of changing the distance between your eyes. Very easy with nanotechnology, but your brain has adjusted to seeing in 3d with -that- particular eye distance. And 'adjusted' does not only mean a variable's set somewhere. The whole wiring of neurons in the visual cortex is based on this distance. So I am not saying that it's impossible to change your eye distance, ultimately you'll be able to fix every neuron and do whatever you like; but it is not a simple procedure as one may think. Just like enhancing your hearing for increased frequency range. The senses are deeply intertwined with the brain areas that decode their inputs; becoming suddenly aware of x-rays and uv-light could actually make you see worse than you see now, instead of better. They are all points to consider, if we are to alter this feeble and disease-prone body that evolution has built for us. I give complete support to augmentation of human senses and skills. I also think that many of the ideas in Natasha's proposal are oversimplistic and even silly.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Here's what I think. All this talk about "downloading" your mind into a different body or replacing your body with a different body does sound appealing, but there are a few things that sort of sadden me (or freak me out, either one of the two). The part about downloading your mind onto some other body or brain sounds pretty pointless. Now I know that not much is known about how exactly the brain works and stores information, but here's some basic stuff. Your brain has to be just a collection of cells (obviously) that somehow stores information, retrieves information, and finds a way to work all this information together and make intellectual decisions based on previous actions. So here's where the problem comes in. If you download a mind onto some other blank mind then all you're doing is copying information from one source and putting it onto another. Basically this will result in a cloning type situation. Your consience won't magically transfer to a new body where your mind was transfered, your consience will remain with your old body and the only thing that will happen is that a new consience identical to yours will appear in a completely new body. This does bring a kind of sadness to me, since it shows that there is no possible way to change my body or put my mind into a body of a more ideal person without actually transfering my physical brain to the new body or simply transplanting all my parts to new parts. Now I'm only in high school, so some of you might find some problems with this argument. I would really love to hear some counter-arguments to this post since I sure can't think of any myself. :P Thanks for your time!</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Uploading (which is fully compatible with bodies, whether remotely driven or not) has the following advantages: 
<br>
<br>
* it works *today*, assuming that cryonics works 
<br>
<br>
* it allows you to participate in a richer reality, since unconstrained by physical laws but those of computational physics and co-evolution dynamics 
<br>
<br>
* it could offer speedup factors to a million, resulting in more efficient utilization of time (depending on properties of our universe, our lifetime looks rather finite). 
<br>
<br>
* uploading gives extra flexibility and safety, allowing remote incremental backups, mind morphing, trajectory forcing, teleportation within relativistic constraints, clean shutdown and resume, arbitrary adjustment of time base, and similiar 
<br>
<br>
* with uploading body is an option, not a single choice

I would prefer to be a floating sphere with EM, if you spend time in an environment with an atmosphere, sonic, and chemical sensory input devices, as well as at *least* an EM output device (communication).  Some form of physical environment modification (manipulator arms, or even some force-field/tractor beam assembly) would be the final thing really necessary.

For other things, like self-replication (of the physical shell, as well as the physical substrate on which the mind exists), it goes without saying that it would be necessary.

<br>
<br>
Already people who receive alterations (plastic surgery) are looked upon as un-natural. I personally take a "what you don't know, won't hurt you" stance. Thus something which looks natural would survive the longest. Sure we would all love a third arm protruding from our heads, so we can hold the mirror as we shave, but imagine the social scrutiny. 
<br>
<br>
We are social creatures. We live on the acceptance of ourselves into the communal whole. To be more efficient but not accepted by others to most may be considered death. 
<br>
<br>
When considering the efficiency of the human body overall I can not fathom a "better" shape. We are very compact yet large enough to do strenuous tasks. Our stationary stance is well balanced. We can articulate enough to reach the quarters behind the large fridge. The human body is also well suited to do fine detailed work. Anything that we can not do with our bare hands can be achieved with specialized tools. 
<br>
<br>
The human body is an incredibly diverse design. Perhaps a different design would be more efficient for a specific task, or a few specific tasks, but it is in the overall that the human body succedes.
<br>
<br>
Who may argue with time? Place a water drop of life in a pond and wait a few million years and you will have what the environment has modeled. Our design has been built from scratch to suit our world. We are capable of adapting to virtually anything.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps that would be an interesting thread to begin:
<br>
"What would be the most efficient shape?"

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>At this stage, wisdom would recommend that a prototype body design resemble a human shape.  Since we tend to sum up a situation within the first few seconds of meeting, an entity would currently be more successful in a human-type rendering rather than a vehicle designed explicitly to show-off its mechanics.  
<br>
<br>
Primo, as a prototype design suggests a "serious fiction" undertone.  In other words, many of Primo's presumed upgrades will indeed become available in the coming years, but are presently at the conceptualized stage.  We do not have the technology to build it today and we certainly do not have the cultural awareness and understanding to fully welcome an alternative non-exclusive human body.  However, this will not impede the realization of body designs, such as Primo, being built, and not to far away.
<br>
<br>
Most people today do not consider plastic surgery to be unnatural.  This is a misconception.  Plastic surgery has been used for decades upon decades to help individuals who have suffered damage to their bodies.  Alternatively, cosmetic surgery performed by a plastic surgeon is sometimes, but not always, considered an unnatural process for reversing the damage of aging.  And, even here, the acceptance of cosmetic surgery, or botox and other ways to revitalize a person's appearance, is becoming mainstream.  My research shows this to be a fact.
<br>
<br>
&gt;We are social creatures. We live on the acceptance of ourselves into the communal whole. To be more efficient but not accepted by others to most may be considered death.&lt;
<br>
<br>
There are many, many levels and layers of social standing. Even within the most rigid, traditional social settings, people are looking for and wanting change.  In that most of the rigid social settings are comprised of individuals who have wealth, these are the same individuals who want to extend and improve their lives, by and large.
<br>
<br>
&gt;Who may argue with time? Place a water drop of life in a pond and wait a few million years and you will have what the environment has modeled. Our design has been built from scratch to suit our world. We are capable of adapting to virtually anything.&lt;
<br>
<br>
Yes, well said.  As our environments change, so shall we.
<br>
<br>
&gt;Perhaps that would be an interesting thread to begin: "What would be the most efficient shape?"&lt;
<br>
<br>
I'm rather comfortable with the present human shape at the moment, although I certainly am not at all pleased with the rusty mechanics and tardy processes it performs.  I'd like to think faster, and be better at telling jokes -:)

Thank you for your comments.

I'm a person who likes to push my body to it's limit. I indulge. Everything in moderation is hard for me to digest in only one dose. Will my future persona allow to me follow a downward spiral to it's end, regenerate myself, race to the top, and ride it down again?

Three comments on some previous posts:
<br>
<br>
"An interesting (an elaborate) thought experiment, but having a human shaped body (shell for carrying one's mind and sensory input) is really pointless. It is a large, gawky, unstable design that we just happend to be burdened with."
<br>
<br>
Without argument I would like to express the extreme pleasure I recieve when viewing the aesthetic contours of an attractive woman. How do you nibble on a speherical ball? Thanks evolution, you've been great. 
<br>
<br>
"first, i think transhumanity is fine, but it is a luxury of thought afforded to few."
<br>
<br>
I must confess my selfishness on this matter. I wish the elite (chosen by me of course) were the only ones given access to Primo creations. Ahhh . . . life would be great if the world was ruled by beautiful/intelligent Natashas and me.
<br>
<br>
"This technology is all great, but do we really want to live forever?"
<br>
<br>
Excellent question. Answer: Live forever and then decide. When you get bored, try and conquer the world. You'll probably be killed in the process.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Well, this kind of body, (being available in our current socio-cultural landscape), would mean that everyone would end-up looking the same.
<br>
<br>
For this to be avoided, our socio-cultural landscape would have to change first.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, i do not think people will want to totaly abandon their individuality. 
<br>
<br>
We as 'individuals' are not just conscious personnalities, we are also bodies. Our bodies are the expression of our genes and are unique.
<br>
Our bodies carry a legacy of thousands of years, and they are our own.
<br>
<br>
I think transfering into a new body such as the primo, would take away a large piece of our intimacy, of our individuality.
<br>
<br>
I think people will want to improve and enhance themselves, but not at the expense of their physical individuality.
<br>
<br>
Being in the primo, would not be totally me. Because i am able to APPRECIATE the current body i have. It is the unique expression of my genes.
<br>
<br>
It is true that i would, as everyone, like to improve certain things and change certain things. But transfering to the Primo would be too radical.
<br>
We would probably want to improve, but KEEP our individual physical expression, our legacy, as well.
<br>
<br>
Also, DO NOT FORGET, that it is possible to appreciate 'Faults' and 'Defects' as well as Qualities.
<br>
<br>
And It is our Faults which shape us as well as our qualities. For example:
<br>
<br>
Would Picasso have been a genius artist if he had not had a  depressive and envious personnality?
<br>
<br>
Would Napoleon have become possibly the Greatest Ruler and Emperor in the history of mankind and have managed to shape and conquer all of Europe, if he had not been Very small in size and weak?

You see, it is also in overcoming our 'faults' that we can make them into qualities, and maybe impact the world in the process!

Wave a configurable body in front of them and they'd jump at the chance to make their particular paraphilia real.)

Probably the closest you'd see to uniformity would be teenage girls all wanting Primo 3M+s that look like whatever that day's teen pop diva is...but the speed with which they come and go will mean that Primo 3M+ will be made so that, as far as possible, its appearance is not set in stone when it's made.

<br>
<br>
A "Primo Posthuman" society would be diverse and fluid. Individuals interacting with transhumans and humans encouraging a sense of prosperity and collaboration, not a hegemony.  
<br>
<br>
The system, policies, or practices of a Primo Posthuman culture would be based, primarily, on multiformity.  Society advances on many levels and at different times and to assume that a hierachy of rich vs. poor is certainly evidence of retro bandits and backward movements attempting to promote fear of innovation and block progress. 
<br>
<br>
A reply to this statement suggested wisely that TV is available to everyone at a very low cost.  In downtown Los Angeles, for example, there appears to be more cell phones used by Hispanic day laborers than upper class black or white executives.  This is a visual example of how products that seem to be purchased and used by a "privileged" subset of society, soon becomes available for all of society.
<br>
<br>
The aspect I appreciate most about the concept of Primo(3M+) Posthuman is that its values are in compatable with emotionally balanced social structures.  Written examples of this are as follows:
<br>
<br>
- Error correction device rather than faulty recollection;
<br>
- Enlightened Transhumanity rather than negative emotions of jealousy and fear;
<br>
- Turbocharged optimism rather than corrosion caused by envy, irritability or depression; and
<br>
- Multiple viewpoints running in parallel rather a single-track awareness.
<br>
<br>
In that most of society's problems are caused by psychological/emotional imbalances triggering  outbursts of anger which, in turn, cause much of the world's upheavals and affect personal and cultural peace.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I stumbled on this web-site and article and was uniquely exilerated. 
<br>
I worked very closely with the team leader for the Quantum computer project between Los Alamos National Lab's and UofI in Champaign/Urbana, and the only time I got this type of exileration was late in the night over coffee it was decided to use the stable coffe molocule to run tests on. [They were the most successful of all the previous test combined!!!].
<br>
I have read every word of the article as well as all the posted comments. Although I have many things to say to individual authors that posted, I will refrain. However, I do wish to state that I am pleasantly surprised at the high volume of negative comments to Natasha's idea. (Even one negative comment is to many for me. NOTE:I am not talking about the constructive criticism.) 
<br>
It is a real shame that the big picture has been presented to society yet society at large can not seem to cope with it. They will gladly go and pay exorbitant prices ($3,000 - $5,000) for a single scan to determine whether cancer has attacked them. Many people will barely make that amount in an entire month. But, when many concepts are presented as an entire solution this same society seems to shake and quiver. Most it seems do not even relize that many of the products you present are actualy in the progress of being completed, others are being funded as we speak, and others are in the planning process. There are but a few that require additional technology, and even fewer that are strictly Sci-Fi. 
<br>
I have had the oppurtunity to see first-hand devastation and death. (Natasha, you seem to mention the societal fringes in the Afghan desert.) I have worked as a Paramedic in Jerusalem during the rash of bombings from 98-99. Your cohesive concept would offer an oppurtunity for those victims to just pick up and continue their lives with a limited amount of daily struggle. They would simply up-load their memories and thinking patterns into a brand new Primo. 
<br>
I truley applaude you. I wish that more individuals with the analytical processing power would present the "big picture" to the rest of society. This should be done in all areas of science, exploration, space, and human wellfare. 
<br>
If it accomplishes one thing that would be to allow them the time it takes to cope with it when the full technology actually comes into play. Thus, eliminating the social problems we currently face with acceptance of new ideas and technology. 
<br>
Thank you again. MMZ, EMT-B/D/P, CCFC, EMD, MBA      </p></td>

Bludy hilarious article.
<br>
<br>
Is Natasha married to Max? I'm a mate of mike price. I wonder if we need more than one body?
<br>
<br>
I mean no body else?
<br>
<br>
One system. 
<br>
<br>
Only one being in the universe.
<br>
<br>
The issue, as a reductionist, is 
<br>
<br>
pleasure=yes
<br>
<br>
pain=no
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lawrence Manning dug around this (The Man Who Awoke)..I think that was in the 1930's "Wonder Stories".
<br>
<br>
On a subjective level, as long as you are maximising your pleasure and minimising your pain, you MAY be performing at peak efficiency.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have heard no arguement against it  that works anyhow!
<br>
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Sure, ultimately, 'we' perhaps don't need more than one body, but in the interim, the separate bodies serve several valuable purposes.
<br>
<br>
1) To diversify experience. ex:  It's hard to experience mercury's surface on Jupiter.  And different forces may seek different subjective values within the range of what is objectively possible.
<br>
2) To break down chosen strategies for coping with adversity based on differing value assumptions to see which strategies are most rewarding.  If X organism puts himself into too risky of a situation, at least it's not the only version of X out there, so he can die and hopefully beam his information back to a secure location before its lost for good.
<br>
3) Bodies may just be a way of creating experience that is subtly varied (other than just high-intensity power fluctuations).  The experience is the mental interpretation of the physical thing, not the physical thing itself.  A hundred minds having 100 different kinds of orgasm is thus likely to be more rewarding overall than the energy of 100 orgasms all being sent to one mind (even if that mind was powerful enough to interpret it multiple ways).
<br>
4) To eliminate unconstructive thinking voluntarily, if you are not attached to the mind doing the unconstructive thinking, you can just leave.
<br>
<br>
These assumptions may be wrong ultimately, because I may not be able to comprehend the capacity of a superior (in the extreme) mind to appreciate subtlety, and designate mental processes to deal with it.  However, the goal of distribution pays a big dividend as the initial way to begin down the path: it distributes power which is INCREDIBLY likely to enhance survival of varying advanced minds.  This also decreases the ability of one mind to hold itself (and thus all of the others) back (with authoritarian malarkey).
<br>
<br>
Ex: What if Radical religious ideas manifested themselves in a group mind?  That would be unnacceptable for the other more logical minds involved.
<br>
<br>
For now, lets try not to let the authoritarians become the supreme controllers of the technology.  Let's encourage freemarket access to the new technology.
<br>
<br>
We can always consolidate later.

   I don't know if this board is still going, but I thought I would leave the little note that some of the things you've mentioned in your idea reminds me of the prosthetic cyborg bodies from Shirow Masemune's Ghost in the Shell. It's very interesting, and I see something similar being created later on down the road. </p></td>
