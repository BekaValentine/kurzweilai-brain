<div class="TeaserText">By the end of this decade, we will have full-immersion visual-auditory environments, populated by realistic-looking virtual humans. These technologies are evolving today at an accelerating pace, as reflected in the book Virtual Humans. By the 2030s, virtual reality will be totally realistic and compelling and we will spend most of our time in virtual environments. By the 2040s, even people of biological origin are likely to have the vast majority of their thinking processes taking place in nonbiological substrates. We will all become virtual humans.</div>

<p>If you ask what is unique about the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, you're likely 
              to get a variety of responses, including use of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, creation 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, even the wearing of clothes.&#160; In my <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>, the most 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> distinguishing feature of the leadership niche we occupy 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is our ability to create mental models.&#160; We create 
              models of everything we encounter from our <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s to our own 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>.&#160; The ancient arts of story telling were models of our 
              experiences, which evolved into theater and the more modern <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> 
              of cinema.&#160; </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> represents our attempts to create precise mathematical 
              models of the world around us.&#160; Our inclination to create models 
              is culminating in our rapidly growing efforts to create virtual 
              environments and to populate these artificial worlds with virtual 
              humans.&#160; </p>
<p>We've had at least one form of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> for over a century&#8212;it's 
              called the telephone.&#160; To people in the late nineteenth century, 
              it was remarkable that you could actually "be with" someone else 
              without actually being in the same room, at least as far as talking 
              was concerned. That had never happened before in human <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.&#160; 
              Today, we routinely engage in this form of auditory virtual reality 
              at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that we inhabit "real" <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Virtual humans have also started to inhabit this virtual auditory 
              world.&#160; If you call British Airways, you can have a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably satisfactory 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> with their virtual reservation <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a>.&#160; Through a combination 
              of state-of-the-art, large-vocabulary, over-the-phone speech recognition 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> processing, you can talk to their pleasant-mannered 
              virtual human about anything you want, as long as it has to do with 
              making reservations on British Airways flights.&#160; </p>
<p>On the Web, we've added at least a crude version of the visual 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to our virtual environments, albeit low-resolution and encompassing 
              only a small portion of our visual field.&#160; We can enter virtual 
              visual-auditory virtual environments (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>-based videoconferencing) 
              with other real people.&#160; We can also engage in interactions with 
              an emerging genre of Web-based virtual personalities with a visual 
              presence incorporating real-time animation. There are also a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of virtual worlds with animated <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s representing participants.</p>
<p>My own "<a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> alter-ego," named <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>, has been gathering a following 
              on our Web site, KurzweilAI.net, for over two years.&#160; Like a number 
              of other emerging "avatars" on the web, Ramona is a virtual human 
              who works for a living.&#160; Aside from demonstrating real-time animation 
              and language processing technologies, she is <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med with a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              of our Web site <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and acts as an effective Web hostess.&#160; </p>
<p>By the end of this decade, we will have full-immersion visual-auditory 
              environments, with images written directly onto our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s by our 
              eyeglasses and contact lenses.&#160; All of the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, 
              image reconstruction, and very- high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connection 
              to the Internet will be embedded in our glasses and woven into our 
              clothing, so <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as distinct <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s will disappear.&#160; We will 
              be able to enter virtual environments that are strikingly realistic 
              recreations of earthly environments (or strikingly fantastic imaginary 
              ones) either by ourselves or with other "real" people.&#160; </p>
<p>Also populating these virtual environments will be realistic-looking 
              virtual humans. &#160;Although these circa-2010 virtual humans won't 
              yet pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> (i.e., we won't mistake them for <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              humans), they will have reasonable facility with language.&#160; We'll 
              interact with them as <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> assistants, virtual sales clerks, 
              virtual teachers, entertainers, even lovers (although this application 
              won't really be satisfactory until we achieve satisfactory emulation 
              of the tactile sense).&#160; </p>
<p>Virtual reality and virtual humans will become a profoundly transforming 
              technology by 2030.&#160; By then, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s (robots the size of human 
              blood cells or smaller, built with key features at the multi-nanometer&amp;#8212billionth 
              of a meter&#8212;scale) will provide fully immersive, totally convincing 
              virtual reality in the following way.&#160; The nanobots take up positions 
              in close physical proximity to every interneuronal connection coming 
              from all of our senses (e.g., eyes, ears, skin).&#160; We already have 
              the technology for electronic <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to communicate with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s 
              in both directions that requires no direct physical contact with 
              the neurons.&#160; </p>
<p>For example, scientists at the <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> Institute have developed 
              "neuron <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s" that can detect the firing of a nearby neuron, 
              or alternatively, can cause a nearby neuron to fire, or suppress 
              it from firing.&#160; This amounts to two-way <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> between neurons 
              and the electronic-based neuron transistors.&#160; The Institute scientists 
              demonstrated their <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> by controlling the movement of a living 
              leech from their computer.&#160; </p>
<p>Nanobot-based virtual reality is not yet feasible in size and cost,&#160; 
              but we have made a good start in understanding the encoding of sensory 
              signals.&#160; For example, <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a> and his colleagues have 
              developed a detailed model of the sensory coding and transformations 
              that take place in the auditory processing regions of&#160;the human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.&#160; We are at an even earlier stage in understanding&#160;the 
              complex feedback loops and neural pathways in the visual <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>When we want to experience real reality, the nanobots just stay 
              in position (in the capillaries) and do nothing.&#160; If we want to 
              enter virtual reality, they suppress all of the inputs coming from 
              the real senses, and replace them with the signals that would be 
              appropriate for the virtual environment.&#160; You (i.e., your brain) 
              could decide to cause your muscles and limbs to move as you normally 
              would, but the nanobots again intercept these interneuronal signals, 
              suppress your real limbs from moving, and instead cause your virtual 
              limbs to move and provide the appropriate movement and reorientation 
              in the virtual environment.&#160; </p>
<p>The Web will provide a panoply of virtual environments to explore.&#160; 
              Some will be recreations of real places, others will be fanciful 
              environments that have no "real" counterpart.&#160; Some indeed would 
              be impossible in the physical world (perhaps because they violate 
              the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>).&#160; We will be able to "go" to these virtual 
              environments by ourselves, or we will meet other people there, both 
              real people and <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_people_entry.html">virtual people</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>By 2030, going to a web site will mean entering a full-immersion 
              virtual-reality environment.&#160; In addition to encompassing all of 
              the senses, these shared environments could include <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al overlays, 
              since the nanobots will be capable of triggering the neurological 
              correlates of emotions, sexual pleasure, and other derivatives of 
              our sensory experience and mental reactions.</p>
<p>In the same way that people today beam their lives from Web cams 
              in their bedrooms, "experience beamers" circa 2030 will beam their 
              entire flow of sensory experiences, and if so desired, their emotions 
              and other secondary reactions.&#160; We'll be able to plug in (by going 
              to the appropriate Web site) and experience other people's lives 
              as in the plot <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of "Being John Malkovich."&#160; Particularly 
              interesting experiences could be archived and relived at any time.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>By 2030, there won't be a clear distinction between real and virtual 
              people.&#160; "Real people," i.e., people of a biological origin, will 
              have the potential of enhancing their own thinking using the same 
              nanobot technology.&#160; For example, the nanobots could create new 
              virtual connections, so we will no longer be restricted to a mere 
              hundred trillion interneuronal connections.&#160; </p>
<p>We will also develop intimate connections to new forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> 
              thinking.&#160; We will evolve thereby into a hybrid of biological and 
              nonbiological thinking.&#160; Conversely, fully nonbiological "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s" 
              (artificial intelligent entities) will be based at least in part 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the human brain and thus will have 
              many human-like qualities.&#160; </p>
<p>These technologies are evolving today at an accelerating pace.&#160; 
              Like any other technology, virtual reality and virtual humans will 
              not emerge in perfect form in a single generation of technology.&#160; 
              By the 2030s, however, virtual reality will be totally realistic 
              and compelling and we will spend most of our time in virtual environments.&#160; 
              In these virtual environments, we won't be able to tell the difference 
              between biological people who have projected themselves into the 
              virtual environment and fully virtual (i.e., nonbiological) people.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Nonbiological <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> has already secured a foothold in our 
              brains.&#160; There are many people walking around whose brains are now 
              a hybrid of biological thinking with computer implants (e.g., a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a> for <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's Disease</a> that replaces the function 
              of the biological cells destroyed by that <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>).&#160; </p>
<p>It is the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> intelligence that its powers grow exponentially.&#160; 
              Currently, machines are doubling their information processing capabilities 
              every year and even that exponential rate is accelerating.&#160; As we 
              get to the 2040s, even people of biological origin are likely to 
              have the vast majority of their thinking processes taking place 
              in nonbiological <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s.&#160; </p>
<p>We will all become virtual humans.</p>

<br>
<br>
I bought a pc for about 700-800 pounds exactly one year this November.  It was 2gigahertz of processing power.  Today when i browse through computer stores for the same price pc they may be 2.5 gigabytes.  At the time i think 2.5 were the most advanced, maybe 3, but today i think ive only seen a 3.5.  Is this a lag in the market? or is Moore's Law of 18-24 months still in effect?</p></td>

I am aware of Moore's Law (doubling of processing power every 18-24 months).  I was refering to what Ray calls the double exponential.  
<br>
I appreciate your comment on the fact that we can not just look at processing speed, and i agree that other areas have infact increased enormously such as hard drive memory (mine is 40 gigabytes and this is quite poor for the same priced computer today which is probably at least 80).  If this is what we are to consider then i suppose Ray is right. Thanks</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have a suspicion that Ray is highlighting this double exponential trend right at the peek growth rate of the S-curve in silicone CPU&#146;s.
<br>
<br>
If you look at his charts I think you&#146;ll see a waning of the computational growth rate of each previous generation of material design before the next material design hits.
<br>
<br>
If you consider an extended trend line made up of a series of S-curves you intuitively know that the peeks must be above the trend and the trough below.  You could reasonably extrapolate out the life of a material design into three equal periods to correlate to the three parts of the S-curve. We are apparently in the last 10-15 years of silicone, the last 3rd of its reign, and so it could be expected we under perform Ray&#146;s expressed presentation of the trend until the next material design hits.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, from the information I&#146;ve gathered there is a body of evidence that suggests society itself moves in S-curves with regards to economy, technology and mood. This body of evidence seems to suggest we have entered a brief (2000 &#150; 2020) period of declining growth in the betterment of each of these components. All is not lost however as it seems historically it is during this period that the greater scientific and technological discoveries are usually made which in tern help lead to the next up S-curve.

The latter were the size of a 3000 sq ft. house. They were primarily used as emergency procedure monitors. Today's simulators are so realistic that the cost of training a pilot has plummetted. The vast majority of time spent learning to fly a modern aircraft today, is spent in a state of the art simulator.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's)are coming out of the classified closet by the droves. I wonder when pilots will be replaced by a computer? How about a flying Avatar? Nasa has almost total control of the space shuttle from the ground. It wouldn't take much of a leap since we really don't see much of the pilot anyway (especially since september 11th).</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Besides the basic technology of creating the devices in the first place, and getting them to talk to the external system, you need to deal with their eventual failure and with the biological system they live in.
<br>
<br>
You want your healthy nanobots to not be attacked by the immune system, yet you want your sick (or dead) nanobots to be "mopped up" by that same system. Perhaps it would be simpler if they were "programmed" for "mop up" after a certain length of time, say by being coated with something that would dissolve with time.
<br>
<br>
Then what does &#147;mop up&#148; mean, and can the body&#146;s immune system do a complete job? Perhaps some device could be attached to the kidneys that secrete dead nanobots in the urine.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is likely that the methods of controlling the immune reaction in the body will be further along before the introduction of nanobots to create a virtual reality take place. The various diseases of the immune system are under intensive study today and will be close to being fully understood within ten years.
<br>
<br>
The technology of nanobots small enough to move within the capillaries of the body and to interact with the neuronal interfaces is further away. However, the use of tiny, intelligent devices to deliver treatments of one kind or another is already happening. 
<br>
<br>
As Ray noted in his article: "We already have the technology for electronic devices to communicate with neurons in both directions that requires no direct physical contact with the neurons.  
<br>
<br>
For example, scientists at the Max Planck Institute have developed "neuron transistors" that can detect the firing of a nearby neuron, or alternatively, can cause a nearby neuron to fire, or suppress it from firing.  This amounts to two-way communication between neurons and the electronic-based neuron transistors."
<br>
<br>
The most likely near-term application for this technology is the control of pain signals to the brain. Imagine if you had a 'nanobot replicator' in your home that could make billions of application-specific nanobots based on software that would control their production. The software could be updated periodically as improvements were made. The introduction of the nanobots into the body would be nothing more than drinking a 'cocktail'.
<br>
<br>
The success of the nanobots in addressing the symtoms could be monitored in various ways with the results sent to a doctor for evaluation. If this technology were available, everyone would be demanding to have it. There are billions to be made by the next Bill Gates.

It's far simpler to inject them directly.

Of course if you want to attack someone using nanobots, then create some nanobots that will brute-force their way in.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Then the substance the pancreatic nanobot is made from is immune from attack, or at least destruction by the body's immune system.
<br>
<br>
I've read of problems of putting foreign objects in the body, such as an artificial heart valve. It seems cells can grow over the surface of the object, or it can leak molecules, or other undesirable effects.
<br>
<br>
Most current nanotechnology seems to be silicon based, which is probably reasonably proof against the immune system. However, mixing atoms (such as other metals) with the substrate can lead to problems from the chemical environment (salts and the alkaline pH), so there will need to be some kind of protective coating, such as glass. Long-term, you can have things like sodium ions leak through a glass layer, which would probably damage the structures below the glass. And you can have other long-term effects, like cells growing over the surface of the nanobot and gunking it up.
<br>
<br>
Then you have the other problem of what to do when they fail. Perhaps they cannot be chemically dissolved by the body, in which case they'd pile up and create problems. I suppose a few replacement nanobots would need to be injected periodically. Maybe some kind of nanomachine/transport could inserted into a kidney so it could capture the failed nanobots and move them from the bloodstream to the urine.
<br>
<br>
Healthy nanobots would need to be smart enough to stay in the bloodstream, circulating around until they found a place to settle down. And sick nanobots would need to "let go" and start circulating around again so they'd be exposed to whatever mop up mechanism was in place to eliminate them.
<br>
<br>
Nothing lives forever, especially in a chemically hostile environment. If the average lifespan of a nanobot was ten years, then over a lifetime a human might accumulate seven or eight (or more) times the number of nanobots that are actually functioning. And given the context here, we might need several hundred thousand functioning nanobots to do the job. That would be a lot of useless silicon lining the capillaries.
<br>
<br>
Food for thought.

<br>
Ray writes: &#147;My own "female alter-ego," named Ramona, has been gathering a following on our Web site, ..  Like a number of other emerging "avatars" on the web, Ramona is a virtual human who works for a living.&#148; I am suggesting in a work soon to be sent to Kurzweil "you have started with Ramona, but better now proceed to Raymond!:)  collecting data through personality capture for later cyber reanimation of your self. this is feasible even now to commence, and on the way achieve another immortality option to yourself and to many other sooner than expected. the mentioned work is aimed to clarify that.
<br>
Ray writes: "We will be able to go" to these virtual environments by ourselves, or we will meet other people there, both real people and virtual people". and I ask, why not real virtual people?! 
<br>
the mentioned work is titled "Ray Kurzweil and the info-resurrection project".
<br>
The &#147;info-resurrection&#148; assumption is that the critical information regarding  a person and his identity can be gathered by reliable &#147;personality capture&#148;  procedure available mostly today and can shortly be refined and perfected.
<br>
It is a matter of fact that your personal genetic code [genotype] can be stored. The  Info-Resurrection assumption, is that you can also capture now the critical information regarding your personality and your identity 
<br>
<br>
Yet,  the info-resurrection suggests further retaining the fidelity of the original person in his reanimated second phase, by instantiating the second phase person on his genetic code. The reconstructed person will either be as a biological clone of himself who also carry his life experience and self identity, or better off as non-biological entity. The dominant role of genetics in determining  personality traits is widely accepted. Physical structure, appearance, intelligence, potential dispositions, abilities, emotional structure and more are deeply determined by hereditary. Of course the real person is a combination of hereditary and &#147;life-experience&#148; and this is exactly what info-resurrection method is aimed for, to gather the salient information of both.  the claim of info-resurrection is that the genotype information, together  with the personality and identity critical information  can  be stored as precious back up copy of a person, in case anything else go awry, to be reinstantiated by future IT. If this assumption  holds water it means that future converging information technologies will be able to use information derived at present time to reproduce a person which will  maintain the critical information of the original self and hence one&#146;s personal survival provided certain conditions are maintained.  
<br>
Good, reliable  and cost-effective back-up copy of yourself, information that can be gathered at present time.
<br>
For substantiation of this assumption, more exploration is required before we set the foundation on a firm ground. that  I am trying to do that in this work.
<br>
The info-resurrection project  would probably develop along these temporal phases. A.  firstly a reliable personality capture to document the your personality and identity critical information, which basically can be done at the present (with certain refinements along this decade). &#150; see W.S.Bainbridge.. 
<br>
b. with the advent of stronger personal artificial intelligence, the  vivid and convincing simulation of your personality in the virtual environment as well as a robot.
<br>
c. with further development of converging information technologies - genetics, computation, artificial intelligence and probably mature nanotechnology - the integration of your genotype in your personalized virtual entity to produce deeper fidelity between the duplicate and the original person.
<br>
d.  further along the time axis, with the gain of more complexity  leading to the emerging of consciousness in these personalized virtual personalities- now manifested as cyber entities, nanorobots, foglets - even bio-humans - or other manifestation of artificial persons - with enough fidelity between the original and second phase consciousness to the effect of their resurrection &#150; if the original is no more - or of storing a reliable copy of themselves, in case all else will go awry. it is one of Kurzweil&#146;s main themes that artificial brains will be thousands to millions times more capable than unenhanced humans, and that the best strategy to avoid alienation, domination or even annihilation of humans by machines is for humans to merge themselves in their machines. The Info-Resurrection method is the most direct way to achieve this merger, In the process to develop personalized artificial intelligence, while achieving at the same time acceleration of GAI,  by illuminating and stressing the  vital personality components of intelligence.
<br>
Personalized artificial intelligence is defined as vivid and convincing simulation of real people in the cyber space. Personalized artificial intelligence project, as integral part of the info-resurrection project, is meant to develop just that, planning ahead and gaining many insights to the enigmas  of human intelligence and consciousness and its greatly enhanced  artificial versions.
<br>
<br>
The prime question regarding the whole method here, is weather we can achieve enough similarity between the original person to his cyber duplicate to achieve survival of that person if required ? that question may be narrowed to the question of  weather we can retain the person&#146;s identity critical information through mainly present time &#150; soon can be matured - personality capture process ? if the answer is positive, then it is clear that future converging information technologies will be able to use that information to achieve first convincing and vivid  simulation and later conscious virtual personalities or nanotech robots which  are reliable duplicate of the original person and even achieve further fidelity by integrating that information with the person&#146;s genotype which plays a determinant role in a person&#146;s behavior and structure. 
<br>
<br>
the genotype information, together with the personality and identity critical information can be stored as precious back up copy of a person, in case anything else go awry, to be reinstantiate by future IT. If this assumption holds water it means that future converging information technologies will be able to use information derived at present time to reproduce a person which will maintain the critical information determining one&#146;s original self and hence one&#146;s personal survival if required or good, reliable and cost-effective back-up copy of yourself.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ray is correct we are already becoming "Virtual Human Beings"  Our hardwiring has already been augmented by the emergence of technologies.  If one is old enuf (6 decades here) they remember when phones were sitting in a room somewhere in the house and answered only by those present or paid to answer them at businesses (usually female secretaries, not dissimilar in appearance to Ramona, I might add :-)
<br>
Anyone my age looks at the speed at which 20 year olds maneuver the computers and the internet, (witness the social complexity of website such as myspace.com and others, where young people create almost advertisements of who and what they are in ways that would be unimaginable when I was in my 20s) We are not the same people we were even 50 years ago, we are becoming virtual human beings.</p></td>
