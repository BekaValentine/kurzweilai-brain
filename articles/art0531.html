<div class="TeaserText">On November 15-17, 2002, leaders in life extension and cryonics came together to explore how the emerging technologies of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and cryonics will enable humans to halt and ultimately reverse aging and disease and live indefinitely.</div>
<br>
<br><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net 
            Nov. 22, 2002. Additional reporting by Sarah Black.</i>
<p>The idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> is inevitable, which I call the "death 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a>," is a powerful and pervasive belief held by all humans, 
              with the exception of a small but growing group of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a>ists. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> leaders of this movement gathered together this past 
              weekend in Los Angeles to participate in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613234203/http://www.alcor.org/conferences/2002/" target="_blank">Fifth 
              annual Alcor Conference on Extreme Life Extension</a> and share 
              ideas on pushing back the end of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Bringing together longevity 
              experts, <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> pioneers, and <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s, the conference explored 
              how the emerging technologies of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> will enable humans to halt and ultimately reverse aging 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and live indefinitely. </p>
<p>I had the opportunity to participate in this illuminating and stimulating 
              conference and I report herein on the highlights. </p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a></b> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Scientist at <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              company, and in my view the world's leading pioneer in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>. 
              He is the author of a book by the same name and the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of brilliant <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual designs for medical nanorobots. 
              In his first major presentation of his pioneering <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual designs, 
              Freitas began his lecture by lamenting that "natural <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> 
              is the greatest <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> catastrophe." The tragedy of medically 
              preventable natural deaths "imposes terrible costs on humanity, 
              including the destruction of vast quantities of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capital." He predicted that "future medical 
              technologies, especially <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>, may permit us first to arrest, 
              and later to reverse, the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> effects of aging and most of 
              the current causes of natural <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>." </p>
<p>Freitas presented his design for "respirocytes," nanoengineered 
              replacements for red blood cells. Although they are much smaller 
              than <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> red blood cells, an analysis of their functionality 
              demonstrates that augmenting one's blood supply with these high 
              pressure <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s would enable a person to sit at the bottom of a 
              pool for four hours, or to perform an Olympic sprint for 12 minutes, 
              without taking a breath. Freitas presented a more complex blueprint 
              for robotic "microbivores," white blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> replacements 
              that would be hundreds of times faster than normal white blood cells. 
            </p>
<p>By <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing appropriately updated <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> from the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, 
              these <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s would be quickly effective against any type of <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>, 
              including <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, viruses, fungi, and <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> cells. Freitas also 
              presented a new <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of a "chromosome replacement <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a>," 
              which would be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to enter a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> and perform repairs 
              and modifications to a person's <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> transcription 
              errors and reprogram defective genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Trillions of 
              such robots could be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to enter every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in the body. 
            </p>
<p>How we will get to this kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was the subject of my 
              [<b><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></b>] presentation on the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a> 
              at the conference. <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>s, the shrinking size 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              in general are all accelerating. Three-dimensional molecular computing 
              will provide the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level "strong" <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> 
              well before 2030. The more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> insights will be gained 
              in part from the reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, a process 
              well under way. The ongoing acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> will provide the 
              technologies to create <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s that can <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> (place sensors 
              in) billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and interneuronal connections, greatly facilitating 
              the development of detailed models of how <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> works. 
            </p>
<p>Once <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> matches the range and subtlety 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, it will necessarily soar past it because 
              of the continuing acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies, 
              as well as the ability of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to instantly share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. 
              Intelligent nanorobots will be deeply integrated in the environment, 
              our bodies and our brains, providing vastly extended longevity, 
              full-immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> incorporating all of the senses, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> "beaming," and enhanced <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              The implication will be an intimate merger between the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> and the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process it spawned. </p>
<p><b>Aubrey de Grey</b>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er at the University of Cambridge, 
              began his talk by citing the fact that 100,000 people die of age-related 
              causes each day, and then quoted Bertrand Russell's statement that 
              "some of us think this is rather a pity." (Albeit Russell 
              was talking about nuclear war rather than aging.) de Grey described 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> he has devised to approach the goal of extreme <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> 
              "with a hard-headed, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering frame of <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a>." He described 
              his goal as "engineered negligible senescence," referring 
              to the term "negligible senescence" that Tuck Finch introduced 
              in 1990, defined as "the absence of a statistically detectable 
              inverse correlation between age and remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy." 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> takes for granted the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of this inverse correlation 
              (between age and remaining <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> expectancy), but de Grey explained 
              why he feels we have the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> close at hand to flatten out 
              this curve. His <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> (to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered negligible senescence) 
              "focuses mainly on those subtle changes, the ones that accumulate 
              throughout <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and only snowball into pathology rather late. That's 
              why '<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered negligible senescence' is an accurate term for my 
              goal&#8212;I aim to eliminate those subtle changes, so allowing the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>/organ/body 
              to use its existing homeostatic prowess to maintain us in a physically 
              un-deteriorating state indefinitely."</p>
<p> de Grey argued persuasively for the feasibility of this goal and 
              described a multi-faceted <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to address each known area of 
              aging, including his area of specialty in <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a>l mutations 
              and lysosomal aggregates. He proposed an "Institute of Biomedical 
              Gerontology," with a budget of $100 million, to promote, coordinate, 
              and fund the focused development of these rejuvenation biotechnologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/peterson_entry.html">Christine Peterson</a></b>, cofounder and President of the Foresight 
              Institute, provided guidelines on how the lay person can evaluate 
              the often conflicting advice and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on health and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 
              extension. Christine pointed out that as <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> becomes increasingly 
              specialized, no one person can be an expert in every treatment intervention, 
              so "we are all lay persons" even if we have expertise 
              in some particular aspect of health treatment. She pointed out the 
              destructive implications of the benign sounding creed of the medical 
              profession, "first of all, do no harm." Because of the 
              extremely cautious, risk-adverse orientation that this principle 
              fosters, treatments desperately needed by millions of people are 
              tragically suppressed or delayed.</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/more_entry.html">Max More</a></b>, President of the <a class="thought" href="entries/extropy_entry.html">Extropy</a> Institute, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a>s 
              specialist at ManyWorlds, Inc., presented what he called a "strategic 
              scenario analysis for your second <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>." More described his 
              own culture shock at having moved from England to Southern California, 
              which led him to consider the extreme adjustment challenge for people 
              (possibly himself) in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> being reanimated from cryonic suspension. 
              More pointed out that "to maximize our chances of a psychologically 
              successful revival, we have the responsibility to prepare ahead 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>." Using the discipline of scenario <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> from his 
              consulting work, More engaged in a series of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s 
              that he would encourage people to engage in who have made the decision 
              to be cryonically suspended should they happen to die.</p>
<p><b>Michael West</b>, President and CEO of Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>, 
              Inc. and a pioneer of therapeutic cloning, presented a compelling 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of cellular aging. He emphasized the remarkable 
              stability of the immortal germ line cells, which link all <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>-based 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. He described the role of the <a class="thought" href="entries/telomere_entry.html">telomere</a>s, a repeating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> at the end of each <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> strand, which are made shorter each 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> divides, thereby placing a limit on the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of times 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> can replicate (the "Hayflick limit"). Once these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> "beads" run out, a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> becomes <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med for <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. The immortal germ line cells avoid this destruction through 
              the use of a single enzyme called telomerase, which rebuilds the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/telomere_entry.html">telomere</a> chain after each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> division. This single enzyme makes 
              the germ line cells immortal, and indeed these cells have survived 
              from the beginning of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> billions of years ago. </p>
<p>This insight opens up the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> gene therapies 
              that would return cells to their youthful, telomerase-extended state. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">Animal</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s have shown telomerase to be relatively benign, 
              although some <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s have resulted in increased <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> rates. 
              There are also challenges in transferring telomerase into the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              nuclei, although the gene therapy <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> required is making 
              solid <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. West expressed confidence that new techniques would 
              provide the ability to transfer the telomerase into the nuclei, 
              and to overcome the <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> issue. Telomerase gene therapy holds 
              the promise of indefinitely rejuvenating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> somatic (non-germ 
              line) cells i.e., all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cells. </p>
<p>West addressed the ethical controversies surrounding <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> 
              therapies. He pointed out a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of inconsistencies in the ethical 
              position of those who oppose <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> therapies. For example, a 
              fetus can divide in two, within the first two weeks after <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              and prior to implantation in the mother's womb, to create identical 
              twins. This demonstrates that a unique <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> is not defined 
              by a fertilized egg <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, but only by an implanted <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>. Stem 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> therapies use fetal cells prior to this individuation process. 
              West pointed out the dramatic health benefits that <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> therapies 
              promise, including the ability to create new cells and organs to 
              treat a wide variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's disease</a> and 
              heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. West also described promising new <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies in 
              the field of "human <a class="thought" href="#">somatic cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering" to create 
              new tissues with a patient's own <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> by modifying one type of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              (such as a skin <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>) directly into another (such as a pancreatic 
              Islet <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> or a heart <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>) without the use of fetal <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s. 
            </p>
<p><b>Greg Fahy</b>, Chief Scientific Officer of 21st Century <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a>, 
              formerly director of an organ <a class="thought" href="entries/cryopreservation_entry.html">cryopreservation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> at the American 
              Red Cross and a similar <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for the Naval Medical <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Institute, 
              described prospects for preserving organs for long periods of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. 
              He pointed out how we now have "the ability to perfuse whole 
              kidneys with cryoprotectants at concentrations that formerly were 
              uniformly fatal, but which currently produce little or no injury." 
            </p>
<p>The immediate goal of Fahy's <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is to preserve transplant 
              organs for substantially longer periods of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> than is currently 
              feasible. Fahy pointed out that by combining these techniques with 
              the therapeutic cloning technologies being developed by Michael 
              West and his colleagues, it will be possible in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> for people 
              to keep a supply of replacements for all of their organs, to be 
              immediately available in emergencies. He painted a picture "of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> when organs are grown, stored, and transported as easily 
              as blood is today."</p>
<p>To suggest a way to make it to that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, I [<b><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></b>] 
              had the opportunity to present a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of ideas to apply our current 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a>. My earlier presentation focused on 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in the 21st century, whereas this presentation 
              described how we could live to see (and enjoy!) the century ahead. 
              These ideas are drawn from an upcoming book, A Short Guide to a 
              Long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, which I am coauthoring with <a class="thought" href="entries/grossman_entry.html">Terry Grossman</a>, M.D., a leading 
              longevity expert. </p>
<p>These ideas should be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as "a bridge to a bridge 
              to a bridge," in that they provide the means to remain healthy 
              and vital until the full flowering of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> revolution 
              within 20 years, which in turn will bring us to the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>) revolution ten years after that. The latter 
              revolution will radically redefine our <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a>. 
            </p>
<p>I pointed out that the leading causes of <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> (heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, stroke, diabetes, kidney <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, liver <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>) do not 
              appear out of the blue. They are the end result of processes that 
              are decades in the making. You can understand where you are personally 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ion of these processes and end (and reverse) the 
              lethal march towards these <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that Dr. Grossman 
              and I have devised allows you to assess how longstanding imbalances 
              in your metabolic processes can be corrected before you "fall 
              off the cliff." This <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is not "plug and play," 
              but the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is available and can be applied through a comprehensive 
              and concerted effort. </p>
<p>The nutritional <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that Dr. Grossman and I recommend provides 
              the best of the two contemporary poles of nutritional <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. 
              The Atkins <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> has correctly identified the dangers of a 
              high-glycemic-index diet as causing imbalances in the sugar and 
              insulin cycle, but does not focus on the equally <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant rebalancing 
              of omega 3 and omega 6 fats, and cutting down on the pro-inflammatory 
              fats in <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> products. Conversely, the low-fat <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> of Ornish 
              and Pritikin has not placed sufficient attention on cutting down 
              on high-glycemic-index starches. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> recommends a moderately 
              low level of carbohydrates, dramatic <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>s in high-glycemic-index 
              carbohydrates, as well as moderately low levels of fat, with an 
              emphasis on the anti-inflammatory Omega-3 fats found in nuts, fish, 
              and flaxseed. </p>
<p>A study of nurses showed that those nurses who ate at least a handful 
              of nuts (one ounce) each day had 75% less heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> than the 
              nurses who did not eat nuts. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> also includes aggressive 
              supplementation to obtain optimal lipid levels, reduce inflammation, 
              correct potential problems with the methylation (folic acid) cycle, 
              attain and maintain an optimal weight, and maintain glucose and 
              insulin levels in a healthy balance. </p>
<p>In a rare lecture, <b>Eric Drexler</b>, author of <a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a>, 
              the seminal book that introduced the field two decades ago, and 
              widely regarded as the father of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, reflected on the 
              state of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> field and its prospects. Drexler pointed 
              out that the term "nanotechnology" has broadened from 
              his original <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion, which was the precise positional control 
              of chemical reactions to any <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that deals with measurements 
              of less than 100 nanometers. Drexler pointed to <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> as an <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> 
              proof of the feasibility of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-designed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, Drexler pointed out, will not be restricted to the limitations 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. He said that although the field was initially controversial, 
              no sound criticism has emerged for his original ideas. Drexler dramatically 
              stated, "I therefore declare victory by default." </p>
<p>Drexler cited the powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> relating atoms and bits to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. We can write a piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to perform a certain 
              manipulation on several <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s. We can then use <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> and loops 
              to perform that same manipulation billions or trillions of times, 
              even though we only have to write the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> once. Similarly, 
              we can <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to perform the same nanoscale 
              mechanical manipulations billions or trillions of times and in billions 
              or trillions of locations.<br>
<br>
              Drexler described the broad applicability of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> to revolutionize 
              many areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> endeavor. We will be able to build <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s 
              that are one thousandth of the size of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. We will be 
              able to create electricity-generating solar panels at almost no 
              cost. We will be able to build extremely inexpensive spacecraft 
              out of diamond fiber. "The idea that our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> world is limited 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> is going to be obsolete very soon, as soon as these 
              technologies become available," Drexler pointed out. Indeed, 
              all manufacturing will be revolutionized. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>-based manufacturing 
              will make feasible the ability to create any customized product 
              we can define at extremely low cost from inexpensive raw materials 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>.</p>
<p>With regard to our health, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> will be able to reconstruct 
              and rebuild just about everything in our bodies. Nanoscale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              will enter all of our cells and proofread our <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, patch the <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a>, 
              destroy <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s, remove waste materials, and rebuild our bodies 
              and brains in ways unimaginable today. Drexler defined this goal 
              as "permanent health."</p>
<p>Drexler expressed <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> for the prospects of successful reanimation 
              of cryonically preserved people. Nanorobots will be able to assess, 
              analyze, and investigate the state of the preserved cells, tissues, 
              and fluids; perform microscopic and nanoscopic repairs on every 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and connection, and remove cryopreservatives. He chided other 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> supporters for making the "pessimistic argument" 
              that although <a class="thought" href="entries/cryonics_entry.html">cryonics</a> had only a small chance of working, this 
              chance was better than the alternative, which provided no chance 
              for a second <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Based on our growing <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and confidence 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and emerging scenarios for applying these technologies 
              to the reanimation task, Drexler argued that we should be expressing 
              a valid <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> about the prospects for a healthy second <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> after 
              suspension. </p>
<p>Drexler was asked what he <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of the prospects for optical 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. He replied that <a class="thought" href="entries/optical_computer_entry.html">optical computer</a>s will remain 
              bulkier than <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s and thus are likely 
              to remain special purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. As for <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, there 
              are designs for possible room-temperature quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with 
              dozens of qubits, but the prospects for <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> are still 
              not clear.</p>
<p>Drexler was pessimistic on the prospects for picotechnology (<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              on a scale 1000 times smaller than <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>). He explained 
              that one would need the conditions of a <a class="thought" href="entries/neutron_entry.html">neutron</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> to make this 
              feasible, and even then there are theoretical problems getting <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s to perform useful functions such as <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. </p>
<p>I would point out that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> also appeared unlikely until 
              Drexler came along and showed how we could build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that go 
              beyond the nanomachines of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> Drexler is likely to 
              provide the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual designs to build <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that go beyond 
              the picomachines of atomic nuclei and atoms. </p>
<p>I have that penciled in for 2072.</p>

To me it sounds perhaps a little silly to suggest that an individual's choice to pursue self-improvement should be arbitrarily handcuffed by the existence of some other person's tendency for self-destructive activities. 
<br>
<br>
Additionally it seems to me that successful self-improvements of one person (or group) free previously unavailable resources that can be plowed back into helping those less fortunate individuals (groups) with their own respective self-improvements. 
<br>
<br>
Lastly I don't see that there is necessarily any kind of direct link between something like lifespan extensions and preventing war or removing starvation whereby the actions toward one goal ipso facto prevent or retard the accomplish of the other goals.
<br>
<br>
I never have liked the argument that we scrap developments of real value in one direction until we solve all the possible problems in some other arbitrary direction. Like the common argument that we scrap all space exploration until we solve starvation. Many activities are completely unrelated and discontinuing one does almost nothing to improve the other.

That doesn't mean we should stop working on all the other problems of mankind.  It just means that the pursuit of immortality sounds ludicrous in the face of lives that most often end in deaths that are not natural.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Yeah. I never meant to suggest that this specific life extension was necessarily more important than the other goals you bring forward. Just that it seems to me they can all be pursued relatively simultaneously without significantly degrading the efforts given to each pursuit.
<br>
<br>
Ironic? Yeah. But it seems to me life if pretty full of irony.
<br>
<br>
You know you are right that many people die from accidents and extending the natural lifespan of people would not directly remove those dangers. However I believe you'll find in the developed world natural causes account for the vast majority of deaths. In fact the last time I did a little research on this subject I think I found the estimate of human lifespan in developed countries given the removal of all natural forms of death including aging would be around 700 years.
<br>
<br>
One would then seem to have a fair bit of extra time to continue rectifying the other problems before perishing because of them.

<br>
<br>
The problem with the prospects for pico technology is that the fundamental building block(s) of matter are not particles.  Our atom smashing experiments reveal a fluid realm of wave harmonics and "resonances".  We call these phenomena particles, but the truth is that their behavior has very little in common with non-subatomic objects such as atoms etc.  Quantum level phenomena are MUCH more fluid/wave-like then particle like.  They are very unstable, morphing between states and splitting and such.  Then there is the so-called "quantum indeterminacy" factor (this is really just due to our lack of understanding at that level).  How can you build anything usefull out of indeterminacy?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>""How can you build anything useful out of indeterminacy? "" 
<br>
<br>
"you figure it out through trial and error ;)"
<br>
<br>
That is true in the non-quantum world, but the process of figuring anything out is actually the indeterminate becoming determinate.  According to Heisenberg and current orthodoxy, however, the quantum realm is FUNDAMENTALLY indeterminate, not just practically indeterminate, but actually nondeterminable.  Not only do we not know what nature is doing at the quantum scale, but (according to the theory) we CAN'T know because nature itself doesn't know (?!).  I don't buy into that of course, but the point is that in order to do theoretical exploratory engineering (or any engineering for that matter) you have to have determinacy.  You have to have knowledge and knowable structures; otherwise you really have nothing to build with or upon.  Picotechnology is currently not yet even in the theoretical exploratory engineering phase.  We can't even begin exploring without some prior knowledge and gaining this knowledge has been fundamentally outlawed (not that it makes any real physical difference) by the Protectors of the Sanctity of the Theory (Bohr, Heisenberg etc.).
<br>
<br>
Evolution certainly uses determinant molecular structures with which to evolve.  The 'indeterminacy' does not even come into play until you reach the quantum scale, with which we have no experience, so (according to orthodoxy) every real-world metaphor you try to use has no correlation with the pico realm.
<br>
<br>
However, I don't buy into orthodoxy so, to me the main roadblock for picotech is the root of the "indeterminacy" itself -- the fluid nature of the pico realm.
<br>
<br>
"picotech is only the beginning I think...constructed of stabalized probabilistic fluctuations/quantum wormholes/stringstuff/etc-'' 
<br>
<br>
You can't physically build structures out of mathematical probabilities let alone imaginary entities such as Worm/black/white-holes superstrings and big bangs which are merely mathematical consequences and epicycles of a fundamentally wrong and incomplete theory.  Why would you believe in such far-out nonsensical extrapolations when the basic laws being extrapolated are so obviously flawed? They can't even get the quantum laws to fit with relativity theory and they can't get either of them to fit with common sense!  The current model still doesn't even have a clue of what gravity is!  (warped space? 'but space itself (so they say) is empty (X * 0 = 0) != gravity).  If they fill space (as they are beginning to do) with quantum probability (whatever that physically represents) then there still is the question of HOW mass physically warps space.  They haven't a clue so far.   Yet black-hole theory and wormholes etc. are a direct mathematical extrapolation of the semantically empty and incomplete standard theory of gravity.
<br>
<br>
''at that range even picotech will be like giant lumbering planets! "
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the optimism and the scope because I too am very much a far-reaching optimist.  I am merely coming from an alternate basis, the foundation of an alternate physics system that takes into account the experimental evidence of the liquid nature of the subatomic realm (and consequently answers many of the "unanswerables" of the current theory).  It is my view of the structure (or lack thereof) of the quantum realm which makes me question the possibility of achieving anything pico-mechanically useful.  
<br>
<br>
"'we know how to find/cause little attractors- or relatively stable ordered structures in chaos already- "
<br>
<br>
I am not talking about tweaking the VERY DETERMINATE computer simulations and iterations of simple equations that don't necessarily have a direct correlation with nature.  The chaos you speak of is NOT indeterminate.  Do you think it is possible to make a robotic arm purely out of liquid?  What about making one from a matrix of mathematical probabilities that in principal cannot ever be seen, directly manipulated, and can never be humanly understood?
<br>
<br>
I have yet to see any evidence that there is anything solid enough at the pico scale to be even remotely mechanically useful.  The particle aspect of the wave/particle duality is merely the fact that these phenomena are somewhat localized and coherent and travel in not-so-very-strait lines (all of which can be said about wave/fluid phenomena).

True.

&gt;Perhaps it's possible to stabilise these indetirmenate factors, so we can make machines after our current model. Or... maybe we would just have to redefine our current understanding of the concept of machines and knowledge.

This might be the right direction.

<br>
<br>
Right. Nanotechnology probably isn't possible until after the Singularity and then our nexus won't get nanotech but we'll go straight to manipulating subatomic particles and obtain some variation of picotech to planktech. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;Interestingly if picotechnology is possible and femtotech, zeptotech, yoctotech and all the way to planchtech is possible, it would only take 500 years to reach and i wonder what we would to then? 
<br>
<br>
Work in the other dimensions.  Seems to me that to the degree we're only seeing 3 or 4 dimensions of any given mass or quanta, it will be difficult or impossible to manipulate it.
<br>
<br>
&gt;If of course it's possible.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure subatomic engineering is possible, after all nature is already doing it . . . at the core of stars.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I have heard some folk speak of technology "beyond nanotech", such as femtotech, attotech, etc.
<br>
<br>
Let me pull Occam out of a hat for just a moment, and survey the known universe.
<br>
<br>
At the very largest scales (galaxies and galactic clusters) one sees several categories of distinct forms; Spirals, Barred-Spirals, Elliptics, etc. But all in all, not that many significantly varied forms. This is because at that scale, the force of gravity hold sway, and all other forces tend to vanish to insignificance (at least as far as determining large scale structure).
<br>
<br>
As we come down to the scale of stars, we see a bit more variety; main sequence, red and blue giants and dwarfs, neutron star and black-hole remnants of supernovae. Some of this variety is due to the fact that the EM force is beginning to show its muscle, although still dominated by gravity.
<br>
<br>
At the "planet size" scale of things, we see a much greater variety of forms. Given the number of possible chemical compositions and ratios, distance of planet to sun, mass of planet, spin, etc., I would not doubt that there are thousands of distinct "planetary climates/atmospheres" throughout a given galaxy.
<br>
<br>
At the scale of You and Me, we see an explosion of forms; millions upon millions of species and chemical compositions. This is the scale where the major forces (grav, EM, strong and weak nuclear) interact with perhaps the greatest degree of "balance", allowing an incredible complexity of "stable and semi-stable" forms to emerge and persist.
<br>
<br>
However ... as we scale even smaller, we see only about 100 stable elemental forms, and we are unlikely to see many more.
<br>
<br>
Down at the nuclear realm, things are stricter still; largely protons, neutrons and electrons, over and over.
<br>
<br>
In the blast of a supernova shockwave, or in the supercompression of a black-hole accretion disk, matter is torn asunder so deeply and thoroughly, it momentarily becomes a scrambled quark/lepton soup. Yet moments later, as this stuff spews out into open space, the excess energies are released as photons and a few other short-lived exotics, and the bulk of it quickly settles down into ... protons, neutrons, and electrons, in the familiar "elementary" nucleonic arrangements. WHY?
<br>
<br>
Because at that scale, the strong nuclear forces totally dominates the other forces.
<br>
<br>
IBM researchers used a huge machine to move atoms one at a time, in order to spell "IBM" on a molecular substrate. Perhaps with nanomachines, this task will be made much easier.
<br>
<br>
But if you want to form nucleons into "new patterns", like force a cesium nucleus to form a figure-8, you will likely need to set up a resonance of enormous and continuous energy, because the stuff just DOES NOT WANT to take that form, and will snap back the moment you turn off the juice.
<br>
<br>
The idea that you might spell your name out in top quarks, no less build the quark analogy to a swiss watch, is EXCEEDINGLY questionable. The stuff will not obey you.
<br>
<br>
Also, machines "run forward" by exploiting entropy, taking something fuel-like from a high-energy state to a low one (second law of thermodynamics) in order to produce "order" in the formation of some structure. It has been shown that as one approaches the QM scales, this "law" (naturally) breaks down (it IS a law of aggregates, a statistical phenomenon). What this means is that, at and below the nanoscale, it becomes increasingly difficult to make something that preferentially runs "forward" (and thus does "work") as opposed to running forward and backward. This inescapable QM effect places limitations on what can be done at and below the nano-level.
<br>

Yep. Nucleons like all subatomic particles are dominated by the wave nature of matter.  They are waves, resonances and fluxes in the fluid ether (or if you prefer the more conservative, semantically empty concept of the zero point field). There has yet to be found any solid particle below the atom from which to construct anything stable.

Sorry for the nitpicking, but it is loose semantics which is at the root of the problems with modern physics...

<br>
&gt;'' but we'll go straight to manipulating subatomic particles and obtain some variation of picotech to planktech.'
<br>
<br>
The term 'subatomic particle' is a misnomer spawned from our obsession to find 'the ultimate particle'.  As the atom smashers and colliders are finding out, however, there are only harmonics and resonances with varying degrees of stability.
<br>
<br>
&gt;'Work in the other dimensions. Seems to me that to the degree we're only seeing 3 or 4 dimensions of any given mass or quanta, it will be difficult or impossible to manipulate it. '
<br>
<br>
We don't see any dimensions.  We make them up so that we can fit the data into our accounting system.  Dimensions are not real and neither are probabilities, wavefunctions, zero dimensional point particles, etc. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;If of course it's possible. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;'I'm sure subatomic engineering is possible, after all nature is already doing it . . . at the core of stars. '

oooh harsh words.  Calm down a bit setAI.  This is supposed to be a discussion not an outlet for your abusive tendencies.
<br>
<br>
&gt;"you don't BUILD "machines" out of the ???/probabalistic/wave/ether that exists at Planck levels- you provide the conditions which ALLOWS Planck structures/ perhaps even Planck-"organisms" to EMERGE- you don't try to push things around and stick them together- "
<br>
<br>
So without pushing and pulling things (I would say material) around at that level HOW do you propose to set the necessary conditions for these planck objects to emerge?  
<br>
<br>
Once again you are incoherently mixing your teenage-embryonic metaphors. ;)  The only instance of emergent self-assembling structures we are familiar with is the self-organizing actions of complex molecular systems.  These systems are built on tangible things called ATOMS.  There is no such stable tangible object yet discovered at the Planck scale. ALL so-called "sub-atomic particles" are unstable and as far as we know, impossible to construct anything with. Quantum Theory itself asserts that the Quantum scale is fundamentally indeterminate, thus random, probabilistic and fuzzy.
<br>
<br>
You are right in your assumption that tangible "things" can emerge from the structure of quantum-scale matter.  Atoms themselves are are such things.  However, though I have never said it was impossible, show me an example of how YOU, as a representative human being, can take something that exists as (according to theory) mere random, fuzzy, quantum probabilities (or if we assume that they are wrong, a real physical fluid ) and construct (thus manipulating what QM-Theory says is fundamentally un-manipulatable) the conditions necessary for human-designed self-assembling structures to emerge.  I am merely pointing to the inherent difficulties.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise you can argue until you are even bluer in the face that it IS possible, but your arguments will remain merely baseless assertions with no evidence to back them up and lots of evidence to suggest otherwise.
<br>
<br>
&gt;"machines are temporary and limited concepts- they are what happens when child gods are not yet sophisticated enough to create LIVING organisms for whatever needs/desires"&lt;
<br>
<br>
I dig your child-gods metaphor, but machines are NOT concepts.;)  They are ACTUAL objects. ALL living organisms are built on machines. It is the level of complexity of those machines which is the arbitrary threshhold between machinery and life. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;"We don't see any dimensions. We make them up so that we can fit the data into our accounting system. Dimensions are not real and neither are probabilities, wavefunctions, zero dimensional point particles, etc." &lt;&lt;

<br>
&gt;"absolutely correct- but you forget the main point: Dimensions/Probability/etc are illusory- but they are MORE REAL and CLOSER to "the Truth" than the fantasies/ontologies of our senses and "epirical" sciences based off of observation-"&lt;
<br>
<br>
My point is simply that the emperical observations directly indicate that quantum reality is FLUID, hence the observed wave-nature of matter. I am not suggesting that we abandon scientific reasoning or mathematics, but merely that we recognize them for what they are.  These things, abstractions that they are, are absolutely necessary for technology to exist and evolve, but it helps to know what the abstractions are ACTUALLY talking about.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;"once again I think you aren't aware of a fundemental Truth: the most abstract/bizarre mathematical absurdities/abstractions are CLOSER to "reality" and are better models/frameworks/metaphores of the true forms of Existence- than our so-called empirical/reductionist disciplines- "&lt;
<br>
<br>
That is NOT a fundamental truth.  That is simply your assertion that you like the standard model better than YOUR LIMITED IMAGE of the alternate model that I am proposing.  You can like the standard model all you want, but that has never stopped the progress of science in the past.  You will eventually see (if you live long enough) that Physics WILL shift to a fluid-dynamics driven, complexity-science based, simulational, emergent, physical model, based on a continuous and compressible fluid substrate.  Mark my words.
<br>
<br>
BTW the "abstract/bizarre mathematical absurdities/abstractions" of current physics are a DIRECT result of the "so-called empirical/reductionist disciplines".

I don't subscribe to ANY coordinate system as THE coordinate system of the Universe.  As tools of the mind they all have their particular domains of effectiveness.

I am simply trying to provide a physical substrate for the abstract, gaussian-curved space-time CONTINUUM of Relativity Theory, because the abstractness of the theory is the cause of most of the problems with current physics.  Don't you think fixing the problems is important?  Do you even accept that there ARE problems with current physics?  You MUST because you were trying to solve them yourself with your gravity theory (that I so harshly criticized).  Therefore you MUST recognize, at least intuitively, the emptyness of the theory.  We are dealing with the SAME problem, therefore we are actually on the SAME team.  If only we knew what the other person was saying! 8)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The Theory of Elementary Waves (TEW herein) is an interesting attempt to make sense of the quantum confusion of modern physics, but if the goal of the theory is to get rid of the weirdness and anti-causality of Quantum Physics then there are two HUGE fundamental problems with the theory.
<br>
<br>
Note:  This theory focuses on the double slit experiment that is supposed to show the wave/particle duality of the electron. 
<br>
<br>
1.  TEW posits waves as the fundamental constituents of matter.  This poses a serious problem because, as we all know, a wave MUST have a medium in which to travel, after all, a wave is a traveling disturbance of a medium.  The substance of a wave therefore IS the medium.  You cannot separate the two.  A wave cannot be an independent object.  The idea of disembodied waves is one of the main non-causal problems of physics that needs to be explained, therefore positing a deeper layer of disembodied (therefore non-causal) waves does not get us any closer to a causal explanation of reality.  ((Perhaps the REAL fundamental nature of matter is not waves, but a fluid in which the wave-nature of matter and energy would finally find a causal explanation for its existence.))
<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  TEW also posits a sort of backward causation (one that doesn't work). 
<br>
<br>
It says:
<br>
<br>
"The waves travel from the detector towards the source, through the slit, interfere and induce the emission of particles at the source.  The particle then follows the path of the waves back to the detector.  The intensity pattern has already been determined by the dynamics of the waves prior to the particles even reaching the detector."
<br>
<br>
<br>
hmmm'.
<br>
Let's visualize this process: the disembodied elementary waves are emitted from the photon detectors.  They radiate outward from the detector array as a smooth planar wave-front straight through the intervening space (in which the interference would normally take place).  They then they strike the double slit barrier.  The waves passing through the slits form new wave-fronts at each slit which spread toward the emission source interfering constructively and destructively on the WRONG SIDE of the barrier.  The interference pattern would not happen in the space between the slits and the detectors as it would if it were traveling forward, and it also wouldn't form the interfering light cones in the right direction either. The interference patterns would be spread in the direction of the source of the emission where they would do no good.  I don't think this was the result TEW was trying to achieve!   
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, what determines when the EWs are emitted?  Does it just wait around until it psychically senses that someone or something is going to turn on a light?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A simpler answer to the supposed wave/particle duality of the photon is this:
<br>
<br>
Suppose that the 'Zero Point Field' is not just an abstract field of mathematical probability, but that it actually physically exists, and that it is the fluid medium enabling the observed wave-nature of ALL matter.  This fluid is the medium in which light-waves are a pressure disturbance.
<br>
<br>
If this is so, then when we sufficiently reduce the intensity of the continuous light waves in the double-slit experiment, why does only one photon-detector in the array go off at a time?... and why is the timing of this event sporadic and unpredictable?  Doesn't this show that light is particulate?
<br>
<br>
First of all we have to understand what happens when a 'photon' is detected.  
<br>
<br>
A photon-detection event is very complicated and requires a quantum-reaction between the incoming light-wave and a receiving atom.  Remember that according to experimental evidence and current theory, all matter has a wave-nature.  Therefore the reception of a 'photon' by an atom should be complicated by the harmonic interaction between the internal wave-nature of each.  When the harmonics between the electron shell structure of the atom and the light-wave are just right, the reaction will take place.  Therefore the quantum-reaction should be MUCH more complicated than a mere particle-particle collision.  This is exactly what we see!  The firing of a 'photon' detector is chaotic and unpredictable. You can never quite be sure when a quantum-reaction will take place.  The general rate of the occurrence of the quantum-reaction is determined by the intensity of the light waves, so when the light intensity is low enough that the quantum-reaction is not happening successively then the complexity becomes readily apparent and the detector fires sporadically.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note1: The quantum-reaction measurement-event actually PRODUCES a 'photon' which simply is the amount of light-wave pressure required to elicit a quantum reaction.  A 'photon' is therefore a product of the measuring apparatus.  It is a quantitative measure somewhat like a gallon or a spoon-full. 
<br>
<br>
Note2: Just having the right amount of light intensity is not enough by itself to elicit the response.  It also depends on the complex wave-nature (harmonic) interactions between the light-wave and the atom.  This accounts for the sporadic nature of the detection event.
<br>
<br>
So how does this explain the double-slit experiment? 
<br>
<br>
When the wave-front of a light-wave enters the two slits, the slits act as sources for two new wave-fronts. The new wave-fronts spread hemi-spherically and interfere constructively and destructively as expected.  The waves spread through space, striking an array of 'photon' detectors in the familiar light and dark interference patterns.  When the intensity of the wave fronts is high enough the quantum-reactions of the individual detectors within the light bands of the interference pattern are occurring fast enough that very many reactions are happening at the same time.  The photon detectors light up simultaneously forming a dot pattern which roughly maps out the intensity of the continuous interference pattern of the light-waves, very much like the way a TV screen shows a pixilated image of the sky.  When we reduce the intensity of the light, the quantum-reaction rates decrease accordingly, and fewer and fewer reaction events occur until finally we see only one event at a time.  Though still present, the interference pattern becomes invisible and all we see is one quantum-reaction at a time at seemingly random places.  When we accumulate the single quantum-reactions over time and add them together, the dot-pattern image of the interference pattern shows up again.  
<br>
<br>
When you don't know the nature of the quantum-reaction which produces the photon-detection from the continuous wave-front then it appears to us that light is striking the detector array as single sporadic particles and yet it is somehow falling into the familiar wave-interference patterns when accumulated over time.  This simple misunderstanding is due to the fact that the wave nature of ALL matter and energy, including the photon and the electron shell system of the atom, was not accounted for in the theoretical understanding of the 'photon' detection event.  
<br>
<br>
It is the complex and therefore sporadic nature of the quantum-reaction and the dependence of the rate of this reaction on the intensity of the light-waves that makes the continuous light-waves appear particulate when it is assumed that a single photon strikes a single firing detector.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is outlined and explained in a theory that uses no premises or constructions which contradict basic causal experience: no backward time propagation, no "spooky action at a distance", no unexplainable dualities or paradoxes, and no empty mathematical probabilities miraculously rendered physically real.

<br>
<br>
we could probably achieve immortality within 5 years if the best neurologists, cyberneticians, AI researchers, etc in the world worked on it together.  They would need a research budget in the tens of billions of dollars, and to "immortalize" a single individual would cost millions of dollars and probably take a few years from beginning to end.
<br>
<br>
when I work out some details I'll write up an abstract on the process and post a link to it on this forum, but the core concept of the process is really simple:
<br>
<br>
it's a less aggressive version of Hans Moravec's uploading schema.  Unlike Moravec's, "my" process requires neither nanotechnology or superintelligent AI's to model and translate to software your brain in an afternoon sitting.  Rather it utilizes proven technology that we have in working(albeit crude)form today.  Here's the technologies that are essential to the process.
<br>
<br>
1)we have already developed and demonstrated working applications of the tech. required to input and extract data through direct brain-machine interfaces.
<br>
<br>
2)we have the technology to monitor and record all output and input of a single neuron in vivo.
<br>
this has been done, and preliminary work with this technique has shown that accurately modelling it's responses to a given input is not the daunting task many thought it would be.
<br>
<br>
3) integration of neuron-mimicking IC's into an existing, functional network of living neurons has been accomplished in vitro.
<br>
<br>
so we have all we need to make you immortal.  heres how we do it: 
<br>
<br>
 you go to the hospital for brain surgery.  In the operation, the doctors implant arrays of micro-electrodes into your brain.  The first operation only interfaces with one brain function, e.g. control of your right arm.  The electrodes connect to a machine that contains IC-based "neurons".  Computers analyse the inputs and outputs of the monitored 'wet' neurons, and develop a rough model of their responses to their normal 'wet' synaptic inputs.
<br>
The Computer then configures the 'hard' neurons to act according to this model. After this is finished the electrodes begin sending input to the 'hard' neurons, and relaying thier output back to the 'wet' ones.  Over time, the 'hard' and 'wet' neurons will adapt to each other, forming a naturally-structured network in which the 'hard' neurons are indispensable components.
<br>
<br>
As the two types of neurons more tightly integrate, more 'hard' neurons are added to the network, and 'wet' neurons are gradually removed.
<br>
After perhaps 6 months, 90% of your right arm control is handled by that network's 'hard' components. The remaining 'wet' neurons are kept as a back-up in case of partial hardware failure.  Since neurons die over time, the living 10% of the network is kept 'fresh' by the periodic addition of fetal neurons. 
<br>
<br>
6 months have passed; you return to the hospital for another round of brain surgery.  The same procedure carried out in your first operation is completed, except this time a different part of your brain is interfaced.  This time part of your, say, visual cortex is interfaced and slowly migrated from wetware to hardware. As before, 10% of the network remains wetware. Eventually, if you choose, the wetware can be fully removed without any ill effect. This is why. If two highly interconnected regions are migrated, the interconnects migrate as well; presumably the most tightly coupled regions would be migrated simultaneously.  Area A's neurons would connect indiscriminately to Area B's neurons, and vice versa.  This means that the 'wet' 10 percent of Area A's interconnect neurons are connected to 10% of Area B;s interconnect neurons.  Area B's interconnects are 90% 'hard' as well, meaning that perhaps only 1-2 % of the total A/B interconnects are wet/wet.  As more of your brain is migrated, the 'wet' components become more superfluous since the % of wet/wet links drops w/ each 'hard' neuron added.
<br>
<br>
This goes on and on for maybe 10 years; at the end of your decade long transformation, at most 1% of your total brain function is handled in wetware.  Given the almost "holographic" nature of a large neural network, this 1% consisting of 'wet' neurons could all be removed at once and you would not even realize it...  the biological 1% of your brain is no different in signifigance than the 'hard' neurons were when they handled a mere 1% of brain function, 10 years ago.  
<br>
<br>
Most people will probably keep their few 'wet' neurons, for sentimental reasons or a reminder of what they once were, or whatever.  Many will not, but neither group could tell which they were if they somehow they suffered amnesia (a disfunction of memory reduced to nothing but a memory of a now-impossible affliction :) a nice irony, I think...
<br>
<br>
It's taken you 10 years and 30 million dollars, but you are now free.  Hang out near Alpha Centauri 3 billion years from now to get a front row view of our home system's star go nova.  Help build and settle a new universe in the final days of our universe's heat death.  Or get bored after a couple millennia and commit suicide.  Whatever.  It's up to you...

<br>
COME ON! ARE YOU SERIOUS, IMMORATILITY IN 5 YEARS, THERE ARE SOME DREAMERS IN THIS FORUM. THIS IS MASSIVE TECH PROBLEM, PLUS THE WORLD NEEDS DEATH, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WERE IMMORTAL.
<br>
<br>
THE FOLLOWING:
<br>
<br>
OVERPOPULATION ( A TRILLION PEOPLE, THE WORLD WOULD BE DESTROYED, EVEN WITH 5 BILLION IT IS HARD PRESSED.
<br>
<br>
QUALITY OF LIFE, EVEN IF TECH COUND HANDLE A VERY MASSIVE POP, WHAT ABOUT REAL ESTATE, WE WOULD ALL BE LIVING LIKE SARDINES, A PATHETIC  MISERBLE EXISTANCE.
<br>
<br>
DIFFICULITY FOR THE YOUNGE, SINCE THE OLDER TYPES WILL HANG ON TO POSITIONS, NOT GIVING THE YOUNG OPPORTUNITY.
<br>
<br>
ZERO BIRTH RTAE WOULD HAVE TO BE UNDERTAKEN, THEN YOU WOULD BE LEFT WITH THE SAME OLD TIRED LOT. IT IT THE YOUNG, THE NEW, THAT BRING IDEALS, VITALIY
<br>
AND INNOVATION. SOCIETY WOULD STAGNATE. 
<br>
<br>
GOING INTO SPACE (TO HANDLE POP), GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE THERE, IN A TIN CAN. 
<br>
<br>
IMMORATLITY WOULD BE LIKE A CANCER TO THE UNIVERSE, I COULD THINK OF NOTHING WORSE THAN A ENDLESS GROWING HUMAN MASS, CONSUMING EVERYTHING LIKE LOCUSTS. HUMANS HAVE SHOWN SUCH STABILITY AND WISDOM IN THEIR HISTORY, PLUS CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
<br>
<br>
THE ONLY FORM OF IMMORTALITY THAT IS FEASIBLE IS ELECTRONIC.

All the technology needed to achieve machine-based immortality exists today.  Some of the technology is fairly mature; the rest is proven to work yet still in a primitive state, just like biotech was 20 years ago.  I detail it here: http://users.rcn.com/standley/AI/immortality.htm
<br>
<br>
would it be difficult,expensive, and at first, risky? hell yes. But it can be done within 5 years.  If you read my essay on it, I think you'll find that my logic and facts are sound.  I can provide references to back up each assertion I make if asked to.  Check it out, I think it'll be interesting

<br>
<br>
Though maybe through future technologies we could restore body and brain function of a corpse, what about the mind, surely you cannot recover conscious awareness through the Cryonic root.
<br>
<br>
In restoring body/brain function you would simply "wake up" an "identical twin" with no past knowledge of self... No sense of "I'" (I am me)... Surely conscious function of who we are grows from birth... a re-awakened clone would be similarly a "new birth" that would build its own conscious function. If I were cloned the awakened clone would not have my "I am me awareness" but its own "I am me awareness" ...The clone would not be "me".
<br>
<br>
The goal is to stay alive so that our consciousness can immortalised. Once we die then that consciousness will be gone. By consciousness I mean our sense of self.
