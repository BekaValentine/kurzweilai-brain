<div class="TeaserText">In this third in a series of letters addressing molecular assemblers, Eric Drexler responds to Prof. Richard Smalley's response to Drexler's original open letter. Countering Smalley's argument that solution-phase chemistry is required, Drexler explains that nanofactories are instead based on mechanosynthesis -- "machine-phase" chemistry -- and "need no impossible fingers to control the motion of individual atoms within reactants." </div>

<br><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net 
            Nov. 1, 2003 </i>
<p>Dear Prof. Smalley,</p>
<p>I'm glad you found my early work stimulating, and applaud your 
              goal of debunking nonsense in <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. I hope that our exchange 
              will result in broader discussion within the community, and in better 
              understanding of molecular manufacturing as a strategic <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive.</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of your questions and of misperceptions 
              frequently articulated in the press, I should first sketch the fundamental 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of molecular manufacturing. These spring from <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>'s 
              famous 1959 talk, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," 
              which envisioned using productive <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry--factories--to build 
              smaller factories, leading ultimately to nanomachines building atomically 
              precise products. </p>
<p>Although inspired by <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> (where nanomachines regularly build 
              more nanomachines despite quantum uncertainty and thermal <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>), 
              Feynman's vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical, 
              not <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>. Molecular manufacturing concepts follow this lead.</p>
<p>Hence, to visualize how a nanofactory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> works, it helps to 
              consider a conventional factory system. The technical questions 
              you raise reach beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> to systems <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Problems 
              of control, transport, error rates, and <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> failure have answers 
              involving <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, conveyors, <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> margins, and failure-tolerant 
              redundancy. These issues are explored in technical depth in my book 
              "Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">Computation</a>" 
              (Wiley/Interscience, 1992), which describes the physical basis for 
              desktop-scale nanofactories able to build atomically precise macroscopic 
              products, including more nanofactories.</p>
<p>These nanofactories contain no enzymes, no living cells, no swarms 
              of roaming, replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s. Instead, they use computers for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly precise control, conveyors for parts transport, and positioning 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s of assorted sizes to assemble small parts into larger parts, 
              building macroscopic products. The smallest devices position molecular 
              parts to assemble <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s through mechanosynthesis--"machine-phase" 
              chemistry.</p>
<p>Machine- and solution-phase chemistry share fundamental physical 
              principles, yet differ greatly. In machine-phase chemistry, conveyors 
              and positioners (not solvents and thermal motion) bring reactants 
              together. The resulting positional control (not positional differences 
              in reactivity) enables reliable site-specific reactions. Bound groups 
              adjacent to reactive groups can provide tailored environments that 
              reproduce familiar effects of solvation and catalysis. Positional 
              control itself enables a strong catalytic effect: It can align reactants 
              for repeated collisions in optimal geometries at vibrational (greater 
              than terahertz) frequencies.</p>
<p>Further, positional control naturally avoids most side reactions 
              by preventing unwanted encounters between potential reactants. Transition-state 
              theory indicates that, for suitably chosen reactants, positional 
              control will enable synthetic steps at megahertz frequencies with 
              the reliability of digital <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s in a computer. The 
              supporting analysis for this conclusion appears in "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614010519/http://www.foresight.org/Nanosystems/toc.html#c1%3E" target="_blank">Nanosystems</a>" 
              and has withstood a decade of scientific scrutiny.</p>
<p>It should be clear that chemical reactions (whether machine-phase 
              or conventional) need no impossible fingers to control the motion 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> atoms within reactants. As <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s come together 
              and react, their atoms (being "sticky") stay bonded to 
              neighbors, and thus need no separate fingers to hold them. If particular 
              conditions will yield the wrong product, one must either choose 
              different conditions (different positions, reactants, adjacent groups) 
              or choose another synthetic target. Direct positional control of 
              reactants is both achievable and revolutionary; talk of additional, 
              impossible control has been a distraction.</p>
<p>What can be made using mechanosynthesis? Organic and organometallic 
              reactions in solution-phase and chemical vapor deposition systems 
              can, in the hands of skilled chemists, produce a vast <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> 
              of structures. These include all the products of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, 
              as well as metals, <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a>s, diamond, and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>. Augmenting 
              such chemistries with positional control of reactants will enable 
              the fabrication of macroscale products containing chemically diverse 
              structures in complex, precise, functional arrangements. Nanofactories 
              based on mechanosynthesis thus will be powerful enablers for a wide 
              range of other <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies.</p>
<p>Synthetic reactions and molecular machinery of the sort required 
              for nanofactories have parallels in known systems, and have been 
              explored using computational chemistry by Georgia Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> 
              professor Ralph Merkle and others. The physical realization of nanofactories, 
              however, will require a multistage systems engineering effort. In 
              1959, Feynman suggested scaling down macroscopic machines. In 2003, 
              the flourishing of nanotechnologies suggests a bottom-up strategy: 
              using self-assembly (and perhaps scanning probes) to build solution-phase 
              molecular machines, using these to gain limited positional control 
              of synthesis, and then leveraging this ability to build systems 
              enabling greater control. Thus, multiple areas of current <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              (in computational chemistry, organic synthesis, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> engineering, 
              supramolecular chemistry, and scanning-probe manipulation of atoms 
              and molecules) constitute <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward molecular manufacturing.</p>
<p>However, because it is a systems engineering goal, molecular manufacturing 
              cannot be achieved by a collection of uncoordinated <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> projects. 
              Like any major engineering goal, it will require the design and 
              analysis of desired systems, and a coordinated effort to develop 
              parts that work together as an integrated whole.</p>
<p>Why does this goal <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>? <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">Element</a>ary physical principles indicate 
              that molecular manufacturing will be enormously productive. Scaling 
              down moving parts by a factor of a million multiplies their frequency 
              of operation--and in a factory, their <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> per unit mass--by 
              the same factor. Building with atomic precision will dramatically 
              extend the range of potential products and decrease environmental 
              impact as well. The resulting abilities will be so powerful that, 
              in a competitive world, failure to develop molecular manufacturing 
              would be equivalent to unilateral disarmament.</p>
<p>U.S. progress in molecular manufacturing has been impeded by the 
              dangerous illusion that it is infeasible. I hope you will agree 
              that the actual physical principles of molecular manufacturing are 
              sound and quite unlike the various notions, many widespread in the 
              press, that you have correctly rejected. I invite you to join me 
              and others in the call to augment today's nanoscale research with 
              a systems engineering effort aimed at achieving the grand vision 
              articulated by Richard Feynman. In this effort, an independent scientific 
              review of molecular manufacturing concepts will be a necessary and 
              long-overdue first step.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>With all due respect, I would suggest that Dr. Drexler needs to renew his acquaintance with the electronic structure of atoms and molecules.  So far as I know, chemical reactions do not proceed by the simple process of atomic/molecular juxtaposition.  Reactions are site and orientation specific for a reason and a key factor in this reason rests with the electronic environment about any given atom or configuration of atoms.  If that environment isn't conducive to the desired energy and electronic exchange, then the reaction will not proceed. 
<br>
<br>
As for atomic or molecular conveyers, and other forms of "positioners", Dr. Drexler may want to take a sharp look at how such concepts are affected by bond strengths and thermal issues.  I suspect that anything bonded strongly enough to be retained upon and controllably moved by a "molecular conveyer belt" will, necessarily, be so strongly bonded to the belt as to negatively impact any desired reactions once the molecule has been transported to a substrate. Any species bonded weakly enough to the conveyer to be readily passed unchanged and then reacted with a substrate demands solution chemistry, vastly complicating the simplistic  "mechanosyntheis" scenario.  The reason stems from that fact that weak, non-covalently bonded molecular interactions between a reactant and "conveyer" are, presumably, the most desirous for this application.  Such bonds tend to be statistical in nature since thermal energies are sufficient to disrupt them.  In other words, such weak interactions break and re-form many times and any molecule that began transport at one end of a molecular conveyer belt would not necessarily be the same one at the destination. In a gas or vacuum environment, there would be no reliable means of ensuring that once the bond to one reactant molecule was broken, another would be available to take its place and ultimately be delivered to the substrate.  Condensed media with relatively high reactant concentrations would be required to ensure delivery of a reactant molecule to the substrate.  
<br>
<br>
As for inducing reactions by molecular juxtaposition, perhaps Dr. Drexler could talk to some people engaged in chemical kinetic studies.  It may give him a better feel for reaction probabilities.
<br>
<br>
The above comments notwithstanding, it is certainly possible to envision systems in which both the substrate and reactant are favourable and logically positioned for reaction.  I suspect that, with a bit of thought, entirely novel forms of physico-chemical control of atomic position and orientation of reactant molecules that are consistent with the energetics that govern chemical reactions could be designed.   But to even begin the discussion of such systems without a thorough consideration of thermal and other energy transfer mechanisms  is counterproductive.  Atoms and molecules are internally dynamic systems and cannot be treated as stable pieces in a mechanical tinkertoy.
<br>
<br>
"Mechanosynthesis" appears to be an extremely naive view of how chemical reactions occur.</p></td>

<br>
Have you read Drexler's "NanoSystems"?  It's been out for several years, so if it's a crock, I'm left wondering why none of his critics have bothered to tear it apart.  Every attempt at criticism that I've seen so far has simply set up a strawman vision of how mechanosynthesis might work, painted a bullseye on it, and fired away.  
<br>

That unfortunately includes Smalley, who should be able to do a real examination of Drexler's ideas.  That he apparently chose to criticize without at least scanning the book reflects poorly on his judgement.  Even if he is correct, it makes his position far less credible.  
<br>
<br>
And no, I don't consider myself qualified to directly pass judgement, either way - but until I see a credible criticism of Drexler's actual proposals, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, since he has repeatedly called for such criticism.

Regarding conveyors:  Again, I'm not qualified to judge your criticisms.  But what if one created nanometer scale channels in a relatively non-reactive element - perhaps gold - just wide enough to push through one at a time of a selected molecule, chosen to be unlikely to react with another molecule of the same kind.  It seems like that could transport molecules one at a time to a reaction site, without issues of reactions with the conveyor or a surrounding medium.
