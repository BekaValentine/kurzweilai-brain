<div class="TeaserText">The advent of strong AI (exceeding human intelligence) is the most important transformation this century will see, and it will happen within 25 years, says Ray Kurzweil, who will present this paper at The Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: The next 50 years (AI@50) on July 14, 2006. </div>

<i>Consider another argument put forth by Turing. So far we have 
                constructed only fairly simple and predictable <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s. When 
                we increase the <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, there may, perhaps, 
                be surprises in store for us. He draws a parallel with a fission 
                pile. Below a certain "critical" size, nothing much happens: but 
                above the critical size, the sparks begin to fly. So too, perhaps, 
                with brains and machines. Most brains and all machines are, at 
                present "sub-critical"&#8212;they react to incoming stimuli in 
                a stodgy and uninteresting way, have no ideas of their own, can 
                produce only stock responses&#8212;but a few brains at present, 
                and possibly some machines in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, are super-critical, 
                and scintillate on their own account. Turing is suggesting that 
                it is only a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of complexity, and that above a certain level 
                of complexity a qualitative difference appears, so that "super-critical" 
                machines will be quite unlike the simple ones hitherto envisaged.

<p><i>Given that <a class="thought" href="entries/superintelligence_entry.html">superintelligence</a> will one day be technologically

                pretty confidently be answered in the affirmative. Associated 
                with every step along the road to superintelligence are enormous 
                economic payoffs. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry invests huge sums in the

                doing so as long as there is a competitive pressure and profits 
                to be made. People want better computers and smarter software, 
                and they want the benefits these machines can help produce. Better 
                medical drugs; relief for humans from the need to perform boring 
                or dangerous jobs; <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a>&#8212;there is no end to the list

<hr>
<p>Of the three primary revolutions underlying the Singularity (G, 
              N, and R), the most profound is R, which refers to the creation 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that exceeds that of unenhanced humans. 
              A more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is 
              less intelligent, making intelligence the most powerful force in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>While the "R" in <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> stands for <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, the real issue involved 
              here is <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> (artificial intelligence that exceeds <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intelligence). 
              The standard <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for emphasizing robotics in this formulation 
              is that intelligence needs an embodiment, a physical presence, to 
              affect the world. I disagree with the emphasis on physical presence, 
              however, for I believe that the central concern is intelligence. 
              Intelligence will inherently find a way to influence the world, 
              including creating its own means for embodiment and physical manipulation. 
              Furthermore, we can include physical skills as a fundamental part 
              of intelligence; a large portion of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (the <a class="thought" href="entries/cerebellum_entry.html">cerebellum</a>, 
              comprising more than half our <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s), for example, is devoted 
              to coordinating our skills and muscles.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence at human levels will necessarily greatly 
              exceed human intelligence for several reasons. As I pointed out 
              earlier machines can readily share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. As unenhanced 
              humans we do not have the means of sharing the vast <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of 
              interneuronal connections and <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>-concentration levels 
              that comprise our <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>, knowledge, and skills, other than through 
              slow, <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>-based <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>. Of course, even this <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> 
              of communication has been very beneficial, as it has distinguished 
              us from other <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s and has been an enabling factor in the creation 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>Human skills are able to develop only in ways that have been <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>arily 
              encouraged. Those skills, which are primarily based on massively 
              parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, provide proficiency for certain tasks, 
              such as distinguishing faces, identifying <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, and recognizing 
              language sounds. But they're not suited for many others, such as 
              determining patterns in financial <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. Once we fully master pattern-recognition 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s, machine methods can apply these techniques to any type 
              of pattern.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Machines can pool their resources in ways that humans cannot. Although 
              teams of humans can accomplish both physical and mental feats that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> humans cannot achieve, machines can more easily and readily 
              aggregate their <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and communications resources. 
              As discussed earlier, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is evolving into a worldwide 
              grid of computing resources that can be instantly brought together 
              to form massive <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s.</p>
<p>Machines have exacting memories. Contemporary computers can master 
              billions of facts accurately, a capability that is doubling every 
              year.<sup>3</sup> The underlying speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of 
              computing itself is doubling every year, and the rate of doubling 
              is itself accelerating.</p>
<p>As human knowledge migrates to the Web, machines will be able to 
              read, understand, and synthesize all human-machine <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. 
              The last <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> human was able to grasp all human scientific 
              knowledge was hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>Another advantage of machine intelligence is that it can consistently 
              perform at peak levels and can combine peak skills. Among humans 
              one person may have mastered <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> composition, while another may 
              have mastered <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> design, but given the fixed <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> 
              of our brains we do not have the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> (or the time) to develop 
              and utilize the highest level of skill in every increasingly specialized 
              area. Humans also vary a great deal in a particular skill, so that 
              when we speak, say, of human levels of composing music, do we mean 
              Beethoven, or do we mean the average person? Nonbiological intelligence 
              will be able to match and exceed peak human skills in each area.</p>
<p>For these reasons, once a computer is able to match the subtlety 
              and range of human intelligence, it will necessarily soar past it, 
              and then continue its double- exponential ascent.</p>
<p>A key question regarding the Singularity is whether the "chicken" 
              (strong AI) or the "egg" (nanotechnology) will come first. In other 
              words, will strong AI lead to full nanotechnology (molecular manufacturing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s that can turn information into physical products), or 
              will full nanotechnology lead to strong AI? The <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> of the first 
              premise is that strong AI would imply superhuman AI for the reasons 
              just cited; and superhuman AI would be in a position to solve any 
              remaining design problems required to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> full nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The second premise is based on the realization that the hardware 
              requirements for strong AI will be met by nanotechnology-based computation. 
              Likewise the software requirements will be facilitated by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s 
              that could create highly detailed scans of human brain functioning 
              and thereby achieve the completion of <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> the human 
              brain.</p>
<p>Both premises are logical; it's clear that either technology can 
              assist the other. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in both areas will 
              necessarily use our most advanced tools, so advances in each field 
              will simultaneously facilitate the other. However, I do expect that 
              full MNT will emerge prior to strong AI, but only by a few years 
              (around 2025 for nanotechnology, around 2029 for strong AI).</p>
<p>As revolutionary as nanotechnology will be, strong AI will have 
              far more profound consequences. Nanotechnology is powerful but not 
              necessarily intelligent. We can devise ways of at least trying to 
              manage the enormous powers of nanotechnology, but superintelligence 
              innately cannot be controlled.</p>
<p><b>Runaway AI.</b> Once strong AI is achieved, it can readily be 
              advanced and its powers multiplied, as that is the fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              of machine abilities. As one strong AI immediately begets many strong 
              AIs, the latter <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> their own design, understand and improve 
              it, and thereby very rapidly evolve into a yet more capable, more 
              intelligent AI, with the cycle repeating itself indefinitely. Each 
              cycle not only creates a more intelligent AI but takes less time 
              than the cycle before it, as is the nature of technological evolution 
              (or any evolutionary process). The premise is that once strong AI 
              is achieved, it will immediately become a runaway <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> of 
              rapidly escalating superintelligence.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>My own view is only slightly different. The logic of runaway AI 
              is valid, but we still need to consider the timing. Achieving human 
              levels in a machine will not <i>immediately</i> cause a runaway 
              phenomenon. Consider that a human level of intelligence has limitations. 
              We have examples of this today&#8212;about six billion of them. Consider 
              a scenario in which you took one hundred humans from, say, a shopping 
              mall. This group would constitute examples of reasonably well educated 
              humans. Yet if this group was presented with the task of improving 
              human intelligence, it wouldn't get very far, even if provided with 
              the templates of human intelligence. It would probably have a hard 
              time creating a simple computer. Speeding up the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and expanding 
              the memory capacities of these one hundred humans would not immediately 
              solve this problem.</p>
<p>I pointed out above that machines will match (and quickly exceed) 
              peak human skills in each area of skill. So instead, let's take 
              one hundred scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers. A group of technically trained 
              people with the right backgrounds would be capable of improving 
              accessible designs. If a machine attained equivalence to one hundred 
              (and eventually one thousand, then one million) technically trained 
              humans, each operating much faster than a biological human, a rapid 
              acceleration of intelligence would ultimately follow.</p>
<p>However, this acceleration won't happen immediately when a computer 
              passes the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. The Turing test is comparable to matching 
              the capabilities of an average, educated human and thus is closer 
              to the example of humans from a shopping mall. It will take time 
              for computers to master all of the requisite skills and to marry 
              these skills with all the necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s.</p>
<p>Once we've succeeded in creating a machine that can pass the Turing 
              test (around 2029), the succeeding period will be an era of consolidation 
              in which nonbiological intelligence will make rapid gains. However, 
              the extraordinary expansion contemplated for the Singularity, in 
              which human intelligence is multiplied by billions, won't take place 
              until the mid-2040s (as discussed in chapter 3 of <i>The Singularity 
              is Near</i>).</p>

<p>I still run into people who claim that artificial intelligence 
              withered in the 1980s, an argument that is comparable to insisting 
              that the Internet died in the dot-<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a> bust of the early 2000s.<sup>6</sup> 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> and price-performance of Internet technologies, the

              accelerated smoothly through the boom as well as the bust and the 
              period since. The same has been true for AI.</p>
<p>The technology hype cycle for a <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a>&#8212;railroads, 
              AI, Internet, <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>, possibly now nanotechnology&#8212;typically 
              starts with a period of unrealistic expectations based on a lack 
              of understanding of all the enabling factors required. Although 
              utilization of the new paradigm does increase exponentially, early 
              growth is slow until the knee of the exponential-growth curve is 
              realized. While the widespread expectations for revolutionary change 
              are accurate, they are incorrectly timed. When the prospects do 
              not quickly pan out, a period of disillusionment sets in. Nevertheless 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> continues unabated, and years later a more mature 
              and more realistic transformation does occur.</p>
<p>We saw this in the railroad frenzy of the nineteenth century, which 
              was followed by widespread bankruptcies. (I have some of these early 
              unpaid railroad bonds in my collection of historical documents.) 
              And we are still feeling the effects of the e-commerce and telecommunications

              we are now recovering.</p>
<p>AI <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d a similar premature <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> in the wake of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s

              J. <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>. Shaw, and Herbert Simon, which was able to find proofs for 
              theorems that had stumped mathematicians such as Bertrand Russell, 
              and early programs from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 
              which could answer SAT questions (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ies and story problems) 
              at the level of college students.<sup>7</sup> A rash of AI companies 
              occurred in the 1970s, but when profits did not materialize there 
              was an AI "bust" in the 1980s, which has become known as the "AI 
              winter." Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end 
              of the story and that nothing has since come of the AI field.</p>
<p>Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded 
              in the infrastructure of every industry. Most of these applications 
              were <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> projects ten to fifteen years ago. People who ask, 
              "Whatever happened to AI?" remind me of travelers to the rain forest 
              who wonder, "Where are all these many <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that are supposed 
              to live here?" when hundreds of species of flora and fauna are flourishing 
              only a few dozen meters away, deeply integrated into the local <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a>.</p>
<p>We are well into the era of "narrow AI," which refers to artificial 
              intelligence that performs a useful and specific function that once 
              required human intelligence to perform, and does so at human levels 
              or better. Often narrow AI systems greatly exceed the speed of humans, 
              as well as provide the ability to manage and consider thousands 
              of variables simultaneously. I describe a broad variety of narrow 
              AI examples below.</p>
<p>These time frames for AI's technology cycle (a couple of decades 
              of growing enthusiasm, a decade of disillusionment, then a decade 
              and a half of solid advance in adoption) may seem lengthy, compared 
              to the relatively rapid phases of the Internet and telecommunications 
              cycles (measured in years, not decades), but two factors must be 
              considered. First, the Internet and telecommunications cycles were 
              relatively recent, so they are more affected by the acceleration 
              of paradigm shift (as discussed in chapter 1 of <i>The Singularity 
              is Near</i>). So recent adoption cycles (boom, bust, and recovery) 
              will be much faster than ones that started forty years ago. Second, 
              the AI revolution is the most profound transformation that human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> will experience, so it will take longer to mature than 
              less complex technologies. It is characterized by the mastery of 
              the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant and most powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a> of human civilization, 
              indeed of the entire sweep of evolution on our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>: intelligence.</p>
<p>It's the nature of technology to understand a phenomenon and then 
              engineer systems that concentrate and focus that phenomenon to greatly 
              amplify it. For example, scientists discovered a subtle property 
              of curved surfaces known as Bernoulli's principle: a gas (such as 
              air) travels more quickly over a curved surface than over a flat 
              surface. Thus, air pressure over a curved surface is lower than 
              over a flat surface. By understanding, focusing, and amplifying 
              the implications of this subtle observation, our engineering created 
              all of aviation. Once we understand the principles of intelligence, 
              we will have a similar opportunity to focus, concentrate, and amplify 
              its powers.</p>
<p>As I reviewed in chapter 4 of <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, every 
              aspect of understanding, modeling, and simulating the human brain 
              is accelerating: the price-performance and temporal and spatial 
              resolution of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, the amount of data and knowledge available 
              about brain function, and the sophistication of the models and simulations 
              of the brain's varied regions.</p>
<p>We already have a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of powerful tools that emerged from AI research 
              and that have been refined and improved over several decades of 
              development. The brain reverse-engineering project will greatly 
              augment this toolkit by also providing a panoply of new, biologically 
              inspired, self-organizing techniques. We will ultimately be able 
              to apply engineering's ability to focus and amplify human intelligence 
              vastly beyond the hundred trillion extremely slow interneuronal 
              connections that each of us struggles with today. Intelligence will 
              then be fully subject to the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>, which 
              is currently doubling the power of information technologies every 
              year.</p>
<p>An underlying problem with artificial intelligence that I have 
              personally experienced in my forty years in this area is that as 
              soon as an AI technique works, it's no longer considered AI and 
              is spun off as its own field (for example, character recognition, 
              speech recognition, machine vision, robotics, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">data mining</a>, medical 
              informatics, automated investing).</p>
<p>Computer scientist Elaine Rich defines AI as "the study of how 
              to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are 
              better." <a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a>, director of the MIT AI Lab, puts it a different 
              way: "Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; 
              we say, <i>Oh, that's just a computation</i>." I am also reminded 
              of Watson's remark to Sherlock Holmes, "I <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> at first that 
              you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing 
              in it after all."<sup>8</sup> That has been our experience as AI 
              scientists. The enchantment of intelligence seems to be reduced 
              to "nothing" when we fully understand its methods. The mystery that 
              is left is the intrigue inspired by the remaining, not as yet understood 
              methods of intelligence.</p>
<h2>AI's Toolkit</h2>
<p><i>AI is the study of techniques for solving exponentially hard 
              problems in polynomial time by exploiting knowledge about the problem 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>. </i>&#8212;Elaine Rich</p>
<p>It has only been recently that we have been able to obtain sufficiently 
              detailed models of how human brain regions function to influence 
              AI design. Prior to that, in the absence of tools that could peer 
              into the brain with sufficient resolution, AI scientists and engineers 
              developed their own techniques. Just as aviation engineers did not 
              model the ability to fly on the flight of birds, these early AI 
              methods were not based on reverse engineering natural intelligence.</p>
<p>A small sample of these approaches is reviewed here. Since their 
              adoption, they have grown in sophistication, which has enabled the 
              creation of practical products that avoid the fragility and high 
              error rates of earlier systems.</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">Expert system</a>s.</b> In the 1970s AI was often equated with one 
              specific method: expert systems. This involves the development of 
              specific logical rules to simulate the decision-making processes 
              of human experts. A key part of the procedure entails knowledge 
              engineers interviewing domain experts such as doctors and engineers 
              to codify their decision-making rules.</p>
<p>There were early successes in this area, such as medical diagnostic 
              systems that compared well to human physicians, at least in limited 
              tests. For example, a system called <a class="thought" href="entries/mycin_entry.html">MYCIN</a>, which was designed to 
              diagnose and recommend remedial treatment for infectious diseases, 
              was developed through the 1970s. In 1979 a team of expert evaluators 
              compared diagnosis and treatment recommendations by MYCIN to those 
              of human doctors and found that MYCIN did as well as or better than 
              any of the physicians.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>It became apparent from this research that human decision making 
              typically is based not on definitive logic rules but rather on "softer" 
              types of evidence. A dark spot on a medical imaging test may suggest 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, but other factors such as its exact shape, location, and 
              contrast are likely to influence a diagnosis. The hunches of human 
              decision making are usually influenced by combining many pieces 
              of evidence from prior experience, none definitive by itself. Often 
              we are not even consciously aware of many of the rules that we use.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s expert systems were incorporating the idea of 
              uncertainty and could combine many sources of probabilistic evidence 
              to make a decision. The MYCIN system pioneered this approach. A 
              typical MYCIN "rule" reads:</p>
<p><i>If the infection which requires therapy is meningitis, and the 
              type of the infection is fungal, and <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s were not seen on 
              the stain of the culture, and the patient is not a compromised host, 
              and the patient has been to an area that is endemic for coccidiomycoses, 
              and the race of the patient is Black, Asian, or Indian, and the 
              cryptococcal antigen in the csf test was not positive, THEN there 
              is a 50 percent chance that cryptococcus is not one of the organisms 
              which is causing the infection.</i></p>
<p>Although a single probabilistic rule such as this would not be 
              sufficient by itself to make a useful statement, by combining thousands 
              of such rules the evidence can be marshaled and combined to make 
              reliable decisions.</p>
<p>Probably the longest-running expert system project is <a class="thought" href="entries/cyc_entry.html">CYC</a> (for 
              enCYClopedic), created by <a class="thought" href="entries/lenat_entry.html">Doug Lenat</a> and his colleagues at <a class="thought" href="entries/cycorp_entry.html">Cycorp</a>. 
              Initiated in 1984, CYC has been coding commonsense knowledge to 
              provide machines with an ability to understand the unspoken assumptions 
              underlying human ideas and reasoning. The project has evolved from 
              hard-coded logical rules to probabilistic ones and now includes 
              means of extracting knowledge from written sources (with human supervision). 
              The original goal was to generate one million rules, which reflects 
              only a small portion of what the average human knows about the world. 
              Lenat's latest goal is for CYC to master "100 million things, about 
              the number a typical person knows about the world by 1997."<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Another ambitious expert system is being pursued by Darryl Macer, 
              associate professor of Biological <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>s at the University of 
              Tsukuba in Japan. He plans to develop a system incorporating all 
              human ideas.<sup>11</sup> One application would be to inform policy 
              makers of which ideas are held by which community.</p>
<p><b>Bayesian nets.</b> Over the last decade a technique called Bayesian 
              logic has created a robust mathematical foundation for combining 
              thousands or even millions of such probabilistic rules in what are 
              called "belief <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s" or Bayesian nets. Originally devised by 
              English mathematician Thomas Bayes, and published posthumously in 
              1763, the approach is intended to determine the likelihood of future 
              events based similar occurrences in the past.<sup>12</sup> Many 
              expert systems based on Bayesian techniques gather data from experience 
              in an ongoing fashion, thereby continually learning and improving 
              their decision making.</p>
<p>The most promising type of <a class="thought" href="entries/spam_entry.html">spam</a> filters are based on this method. 
              I personally use a spam filter called SpamBayes, which trains itself 
              on e-mail that you have identified as either "spam" or "okay."<sup>13</sup> 
              You start out by presenting a folder of each to the filter. It trains 
              its Bayesian belief network on these two files and analyzes the 
              patterns of each, thus enabling it to automatically move subsequent 
              e-mail into the proper category. It continues to train itself on 
              every subsequent e-mail, especially when it's corrected by the user. 
              This filter has made the spam situation manageable for me, which 
              is saying a lot, as it weeds out two hundred to three hundred spam 
              messages each day, letting over one hundred "good" messages through. 
              Only about 1 percent of the messages it identifies as "okay" are 
              actually spam; it almost never marks a good message as spam. The 
              system is almost as accurate as I would be and much faster.</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/markov_model_entry.html">Markov model</a>s.</b> Another method that is good at applying probabilistic 
              networks to complex sequences of information involves Markov models.<sup>14</sup> 
              Andrei Andreyevich Markov (1856&#8211;1922), a renowned mathematician, 
              established a theory of "Markov chains," which was refined by Norbert 
              Wiener (1894&#8211;1964) in 1923. The theory provided a method to 
              evaluate the likelihood that a certain sequence of events would 
              occur. It has been popular, for example, in speech recognition, 
              in which the sequential events are <a class="thought" href="entries/phoneme_entry.html">phoneme</a>s (parts of speech). The 
              Markov models used in speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> the likelihood that 
              specific patterns of sound are found in each phoneme, how the phonemes 
              influence each other, and likely orders of phonemes. The system 
              can also include probability networks on higher levels of language, 
              such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of words. The actual probabilities in the models 
              are trained on actual speech and language data, so the method is 
              self-organizing.</p>
<p>Markov modeling was one of the methods my colleagues and I used 
              in our own speech-recognition development.<sup>15</sup> Unlike phonetic 
              approaches, in which specific rules about phoneme sequences are 
              explicitly coded by human linguists, we did not tell the system 
              that there are approximately forty-four phonemes in English, nor 
              did we tell it what sequences of phonemes were more likely than 
              others. We let the system discover these "rules" for itself from 
              thousands of hours of transcribed human speech data. The advantage 
              of this approach over hand-coded rules is that the models develop 
              subtle probabilistic rules of which human experts are not necessarily 
              aware.</p>
<p><b>Neural nets.</b> Another popular self-organizing method that 
              has also been used in speech recognition and a wide variety of other 
              pattern-recognition tasks is neural nets. This technique involves 
              simulating a simplified model of neurons and interneuronal connections. 
              One <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> approach to neural nets can be described as follows. Each 
              point of a given input (for speech, each point represents two dimensions, 
              one being frequency and the other time; for images, each point would 
              be a <a class="thought" href="entries/pixel_entry.html">pixel</a> in a two-dimensional image) is randomly connected to 
              the inputs of the first layer of simulated neurons. Every connection 
              has an associated synaptic strength, which represents its importance 
              and which is set at a random value. Each neuron adds up the signals 
              coming into it. If the combined signal exceeds a particular threshold, 
              the neuron fires and sends a signal to its output connection; if 
              the combined input signal does not exceed the threshold, the neuron 
              does not fire, and its output is zero. The output of each neuron 
              is randomly connected to the inputs of the neurons in the next layer. 
              There are multiple layers (generally three or more), and the layers 
              may be organized in a variety of <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s. For example, one 
              layer may feed back to an earlier layer. At the top layer, the output 
              of one or more neurons, also randomly selected, provides the answer 
              (For an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic description of neural nets, see this endnote.<sup>16</sup>).</p>
<p>Since the neural-net wiring and synaptic weights are initially 
              set randomly, the answers of an untrained neural net will be random. 
              The key to a neural net, therefore, is that it must learn its subject 
              matter. Like the <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian brains on which it's loosely modeled, 
              a neural net starts out ignorant. The neural net's teacher&#8212;which 
              may be a human, a computer program, or perhaps another, more mature 
              neural net that has already learned its lessons&#8212;rewards the 
              student neural net when it generates the right output and punishes 
              it when it does not. This feedback is in turn used by the student 
              neural net to adjust the strengths of each interneuronal connection. 
              Connections that were consistent with the right answer are made 
              stronger. Those that advocated a wrong answer are weakened. Over 
              time, the neural net organizes itself to provide the right answers 
              without coaching. <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">Experiment</a>s have shown that neural nets can learn 
              their subject matter even with unreliable teachers. If the teacher 
              is correct only 60 percent of the time, the student neural net will 
              still learn its lessons.</p>
<p>A powerful, well-taught neural net can emulate a wide range of 
              human pattern-recognition faculties. Systems using multilayer neural 
              nets have shown impressive results in a wide variety of pattern-recognition 
              tasks, including recognizing handwriting, human faces, fraud in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> transactions such as credit-card charges, and many others. 
              In my own experience in using neural nets in such <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>s, the 
              most challenging engineering task is not coding the nets but in 
              providing automated lessons for them to learn their subject matter.</p>
<p>The current trend in neural nets is to take advantage of more realistic 
              and more complex models of how actual biological neural nets work, 
              now that we are developing detailed models of neural functioning 
              from brain reverse engineering.<sup>17</sup> Since we do have several 
              decades of experience in using self-organizing paradigms, new insights 
              from brain studies can be quickly adapted to neural-net experiments.</p>
<p>Neural nets are also naturally amenable to <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a>, 
              since that is how the brain works. The human brain does not have 
              a central processor that simulates each neuron. Rather, we can consider 
              each neuron and each interneuronal connection to be an individual 
              slow processor. Extensive work is under way to develop specialized 
              chips that implement neural-net architectures in parallel to provide 
              substantially greater throughput.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/genetic_algorithm_entry.html">Genetic algorithm</a>s (GAs).</b> Another self-organizing paradigm 
              inspired by nature is genetic, or evolutionary, algorithms, which 
              emulate evolution, including sexual reproduction and mutations. 
              Here is a simplified description of how they work. First, determine 
              a way to code possible solutions to a given problem. If the problem 
              is optimizing the design parameters for a jet engine, define a list 
              of the parameters (with a specific number of bits assigned to each 
              parameter). This list is regarded as the genetic code in the genetic 
              algorithm. Then randomly generate thousands or more genetic codes. 
              Each such genetic code (which represents one set of design parameters) 
              is considered a simulated "solution" organism.</p>
<p>Now evaluate each simulated organism in a simulated environment 
              by using a defined method to evaluate each set of parameters. This 
              evaluation is a key to the success of a genetic algorithm. In our 
              example, we would apply each solution organism to a jet-engine simulation 
              and determine how successful that set of parameters is, according 
              to whatever criteria we are interested in (fuel consumption, speed, 
              and so on). The best solution organisms (the best designs) are allowed 
              to survive, and the rest are eliminated.</p>
<p>Now have each of the survivors multiply themselves until they reach 
              the same number of solution creatures. This is done by simulating 
              sexual reproduction. In other words, each new offspring solution 
              draws part of its genetic code from one parent and another part 
              from a second parent. Usually no distinction is made between <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> organisms; it's sufficient to generate an offspring from 
              two arbitrary parents. As they multiply, allow some mutation (random 
              change) in the <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s to occur.</p>
<p>We've now defined one generation of simulated evolution; now repeat 
              these steps for each subsequent generation. At the end of each generation 
              determine how much the designs have improved. When the improvement 
              in the evaluation of the design creatures from one generation to 
              the next becomes very small, we stop this iterative cycle of improvement 
              and use the best design(s) in the last generation .(For an algorithmic 
              description of genetic algorithms, see this endnote<sup>19</sup>).</p>
<p>The key to a GA is that the human designers don't directly program 
              a solution; rather, they let one emerge through an iterative process 
              of simulated competition and improvement. As we discussed, biological 
              evolution is smart but slow, so to enhance its intelligence we retain 
              its discernment while greatly speeding up its ponderous pace. The 
              computer is fast enough to simulate many generations in a matter 
              of hours or days or weeks. But we have to go through this iterative 
              process only once; once we have let this simulated evolution run 
              its course, we can apply the evolved and highly refined rules to 
              real problems in a rapid fashion.</p>
<p>Like neural nets GAs are a way to harness the subtle but profound 
              patterns that exist in chaotic data. A key requirement for their 
              success is a valid way of evaluating each possible solution. This 
              evaluation needs to be fast because it must take account of many 
              thousands of possible solutions for each generation of simulated 
              evolution.</p>
<p>GAs are adept at handling problems with too many variables to compute 
              precise analytic solutions. The design of a jet engine, for example, 
              involves more than one hundred variables and requires satisfying 
              dozens of <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s. GAs used by researchers at General Electric 
              were able to come up with engine designs that met the constraints 
              more precisely than conventional methods.</p>
<p>When using GAs you must, however, be careful what you ask for. 
              University of Sussex researcher Jon Bird used a GA to optimally 
              design an oscillator <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>. Several attempts generated conventional 
              designs using a small number of transistors, but the winning design 
              was not an oscillator at all but a simple radio circuit. Apparently 
              the GA discovered that the radio circuit picked up an oscillating 
              hum from a nearby computer.<sup>20</sup> The GA's solution worked 
              only in the exact location on the table where it was asked to solve 
              the problem.</p>
<p>Genetic algorithms, part of the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_theory_entry.html">complexity theory</a>, 
              are being increasingly used to solve otherwise intractable business 
              problems, such as optimizing complex supply chains. This approach 
              is beginning to supplant more analytic methods throughout industry. 
              (See examples below.) The paradigm is also adept at recognizing 
              patterns, and is often combined with neural nets and other self-organizing 
              methods. It's also a reasonable way to write computer software, 
              particularly software that needs to find delicate balances for competing 
              resources.</p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <i>usr/bin/<a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">god</a></i>, Cory Doctorow, a leading science-fiction 
              writer, uses an intriguing variation of a GA to evolve an AI. The 
              GA generates a large number of intelligent systems based on various 
              intricate combinations of techniques, with each combination characterized 
              by its genetic code. These systems then evolve using a GA.</p>
<p>The evaluation function works as follows: each system logs on to 
              various human <a class="thought" href="entries/chat_room_entry.html">chat room</a>s and tries to pass for a human, basically 
              a covert Turing test. If one of the humans in a chat room says something 
              like "What are you, a <a class="thought" href="entries/chatterbot_entry.html">chatterbot</a>?" (chatterbot meaning an automatic 
              program, that at today's level of development is expected to not 
              understand language at a human level), the evaluation is over, that 
              system ends its interactions, and reports its score to the GA. The 
              score is determined by how long it was able to pass for human without 
              being challenged in this way. The GA evolves more and more intricate 
              combinations of techniques that are increasingly capable of passing 
              for human.</p>
<p>The main difficulty with this idea is that the evaluation function 
              is fairly slow, although it will take an appreciable amount of time 
              only once the systems are reasonably intelligent. Also, the evaluations 
              can take place largely in parallel. It's an interesting idea and 
              may actually be a useful method to finish the job of passing the 
              Turing test, once we get to the point where we have sufficiently 
              sophisticated algorithms to feed into such a GA, so that evolving 
              a Turing-capable AI is feasible.</p>
<p><b>Recursive <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>.</b> Often we need to search through vast number 
              of combinations of possible solutions to solve a given problem. 
              A classic example is in playing games such as <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>. As a player 
              considers her next move, she can list all of her possible moves, 
              and then, for each such move, all possible countermoves by the opponent, 
              and so on. It is difficult, however, for human players to keep a 
              huge "tree" of move-countermove sequences in their heads, and so 
              they rely on pattern recognition&#8212;recognizing situations based 
              on prior experience&#8212;whereas machines use logical analysis of 
              millions of moves and countermoves.</p>
<p>Such a logical tree is at the heart of most game-playing programs. 
              Consider how this is done. We construct a program called Pick Best 
              Next Step to select each move. Pick Best Next Step starts by listing 
              all of the possible moves from the current state of the board. (If 
              the problem was solving a mathematical theorem, rather than game 
              moves, the program would list all of the possible next steps in 
              a proof.) For each move the program constructs a hypothetical board 
              that reflects what would happen if we made this move. For each such 
              hypothetical board, we now need to consider what our opponent would 
              do if we made this move. Now <a class="thought" href="entries/recursion_entry.html">recursion</a> comes in, because Pick Best 
              Next Step simply calls Pick Best Next Step (in other words, itself) 
              to pick the best move for our opponent. In calling itself, Pick 
              Best Next Step then lists all of the legal moves for our opponent.</p>
<p>The program keeps calling itself, looking ahead as many moves as 
              we have time to consider, which results in the generation of a huge 
              move-countermove tree. This is another example of exponential growth, 
              because to look ahead an additional move (or countermove) requires 
              multiplying the amount of available computation by about five. Key 
              to the success of the <a class="thought" href="entries/recursive_formula_entry.html">recursive formula</a> is pruning this huge tree 
              of possibilities and ultimately stopping its growth. In the game 
              context, if a board looks hopeless for either side, the program 
              can stop the expansion of the move-countermove tree from that point 
              (called a "terminal leaf" of the tree) and consider the most recently 
              considered move to be a likely win or loss. When all of these nested 
              program calls are completed, the program will have determined the 
              best possible move for the current actual board within the limits 
              of the depth of recursive expansion that it had time to pursue, 
              and the quality of its pruning algorithm (For an algorithmic description 
              of recursive search, see this endnote.<sup>21</sup>).</p>
<p>The recursive formula is often effective at <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a>. Rather 
              than game moves, the "moves" are the axioms of the field of math 
              being addressed, as well as previously proved theorems. The expansion 
              at each point is the possible axioms (or previously proved theorems) 
              that can be applied to a proof at each step. (This was the approach 
              used by Newell, Shaw, and Simons's General Problem Solver.)</p>
<p>From these examples it may appear that recursion is well suited 
              only for problems in which we have crisply defined rules and objectives. 
              But it has also shown promise in computer generation of artistic 
              creations. For example, a program I designed called Ray Kurzweil's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetic_poet_entry.html">Cybernetic Poet</a> uses a recursive approach.<sup>22</sup> The program 
              establishes a set of goals for each word&#8212;achieving a certain 
              rhythmic pattern, <a class="thought" href="entries/poem_entry.html">poem</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, and word choice that is desirable 
              at that point in the poem. If the program is unable to find a word 
              that meets these criteria, it backs up and erases the previous word 
              it has written, reestablishes the criteria it had originally set 
              for the word just erased, and goes from there. If that also leads 
              to a dead end, it backs up again, thus moving backwards and forwards. 
              Eventually, it forces itself to make up its <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> by relaxing some 
              of the constraints if all paths lead to dead ends.<br>

<h2 align="center">Deep Fritz Draws: Are Humans Getting Smarter, 
                    or Are Computers Getting Stupider?</h2>
<p>We find one example of qualitative improvements in software 
                    in the world of computer chess, which, according to common 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a>, is governed only by the brute-force expansion of computer 
                    hardware. In a chess tournament in October 2002 with top-ranking 
                    human player Vladimir Kramnik, the Deep Fritz software achieved 
                    a draw. I point out that Deep Fritz has available only about 
                    1.3 percent of the brute-force computation as the previous 
                    computer champion, <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>. Despite that, it plays chess 
                    at about the same level because of its superior pattern recognition&#8211;based 
                    pruning algorithm (see below). In six years a program like 
                    Deep Fritz will again achieve Deep Blue's ability to analyze 
                    two hundred million board positions per second.</p>
<p>Deep Fritz&#8211;like chess programs running on ordinary personal 
                    computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade.</p>
<p>In <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a></i>, which I wrote 
                    between 1986 and 1989, I predicted that a computer would defeat 
                    the human world chess champion by the end of the 1990s. I 
                    also noted that computers were gaining about forty-five points 
                    per year in their chess ratings, whereas the best human playing 
                    was essentially fixed, so this projected a crossover point 
                    in 1998. Indeed, Deep Blue did defeat Gary Kasparov in a highly 
                    publicized tournament in 1997.</p>
<p>Yet in the Deep Fritz&#8211;Kramnik match, the current reigning 
                    computer program was able to achieve only a tie. Five years 
                    had passed since Deep Blue's victory, so what are we to make 
                    of this situation? Should we conclude that:</p>
<p>1. Humans are getting smarter, or at least better at chess?</p>
<p>2. Computers are getting worse at chess? If so, should we 
                    conclude that the much- publicized improvement in computer 
                    speed over the past five years was not all it was cracked 
                    up to be? Or, that computer software is getting worse, at 
                    least in chess?</p>
<p><b>The specialized-hardware advantage.</b> Neither of the 
                    above conclusions is warranted. The correct conclusion is 
                    that software is getting better because Deep Fritz essentially 
                    matched the performance of Deep Blue, yet with far smaller 
                    computational resources. To gain some insight into these questions, 
                    we need to examine a few essentials. When I wrote my predictions 
                    of computer chess in the late 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University 
                    was embarked on a program to develop specialized chips for 
                    conducting the "minimax" algorithm (the standard game-playing 
                    method that relies on building trees of move-countermove sequences, 
                    and then evaluating the terminal-leaf positions of each branch 
                    of the tree) specifically for chess moves.</p>
<p>Based on this specialized hardware CMU's 1988 chess machine, 
                    HiTech, was able to analyze 175,000 board positions per second. 
                    It achieved a chess rating of 2,359, only about 440 points 
                    below the human world champion.</p>
<p>A year later, in 1989, CMU's Deep Thought machine increased 
                    this capacity to one million board positions per second and 
                    achieved a rating of 2,400. <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> eventually took over the project 
                    and renamed it Deep Blue but kept the basic CMU architecture. 
                    The version of Deep Blue that defeated Kasparov in 1997 had 
                    256 special-purpose chess processors working in parallel, 
                    which analyzed two hundred million board positions per second.</p>
<p>It is important to note the use of specialized hardware to 
                    accelerate the specific calculations needed to generate the 
                    minimax algorithm for chess moves. It's well-known to computer-systems 
                    designers that specialized hardware generally can implement 
                    a specific algorithm at least one hundred times faster than 
                    a general-purpose computer. Specialized ASICs (Application-specific 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated Circuit</a>s) require significant development efforts 
                    and costs, but for critical calculations that are needed on 
                    a repetitive basis (for example, decoding <a class="thought" href="entries/mp3_entry.html">MP3</a> files or rendering 
                    graphics primitives for video games), this expenditure can 
                    be well worth the investment.</p>
<p><b>Deep Blue versus Deep Fritz.</b> Because there had always 
                    been a great deal of focus on the milestone of a computer's 
                    being able to defeat a human opponent, support was available 
                    for investing in special-purpose chess circuits. Although 
                    there was some lingering controversy regarding the parameters 
                    of the Deep Blue&#8211;Kasparov match, the level of interest 
                    in computer chess waned considerably after 1997. After all, 
                    the goal had been achieved, and there was little point in 
                    beating a dead horse. IBM canceled work on the project, and 
                    there has been no work on specialized chess chips since that 
                    time. The focus of research in the various domains spun out 
                    of AI has been placed instead on problems of greater consequence, 
                    such as guiding airplanes, missiles, and factory robots, understanding 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>, diagnosing electrocardiograms and blood-<a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
                    images, detecting credit-card fraud, and a myriad of other 
                    successful narrow AI applications.</p>
<p>Computer hardware has nonetheless continued its exponential 
                    increase, with personal-computer speeds doubling every year 
                    since 1997. Thus the general-purpose Pentium processors used 
                    by Deep Fritz are about thirty-two times faster than processors 
                    in 1997. Deep Fritz uses a network of only eight personal 
                    computers, so the hardware is equivalent to 256 1997-class 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s. Compare that to Deep Blue, which used 
                    256 specialized chess processors, each of which was about 
                    one hundred times faster than 1997 personal computers (of 
                    course, only for computing chess minimax). So Deep Blue was 
                    25,600 times faster than a 1997 PC and one hundred times faster 
                    than Deep Fritz. This analysis is confirmed by the reported 
                    speeds of the two systems: Deep Blue can analyze 200 million 
                    board positions per second compared to only about 2.5 million 
                    for Deep Fritz.</p>
<p><b>Significant software gains.</b> So what can we say about 
                    the software in Deep Fritz? Although chess machines are usually 
                    referred to as examples of brute-force calculation, there 
                    is one important aspect of these systems that does require 
                    qualitative judgment. The <a class="thought" href="entries/combinatorial_explosion_entry.html">combinatorial explosion</a> of possible 
                    move-countermove sequences is rather formidable.</p>
<p>In <i>The Age of Intelligent Machines</i> I estimated that 
                    it would take about forty billion years to make one move if 
                    we failed to prune the move-countermove tree and attempted 
                    to make a "perfect" move in a typical game. (Assuming about 
                    thirty moves each in a typical game and about eight possible 
                    moves per play, we have 8<sup>30</sup> possible move sequences; 
                    analyzing one billion move sequences per second would take 
                    10<sup>18</sup> seconds or forty billion years.) Thus a practical 
                    system needs to continually prune away unpromising lines of 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. This requires insight and is essentially a pattern-recognition 
                    judgment.</p>
<p>Humans, even world-class chess masters, perform the minimax 
                    algorithm extremely slowly, generally performing less than 
                    one move-countermove analysis per second. So how is it that 
                    a chess master can compete at all with computer systems? The 
                    answer is that we possess formidable powers of pattern recognition, 
                    which enable us to prune the tree with great insight.</p>
<p>It's precisely in this area that Deep Fritz has improved 
                    considerably over Deep Blue. Deep Fritz has only slightly 
                    more computation available than CMU's Deep Thought yet is 
                    rated almost 400 points higher.</p>
<p><b>Are human chess players doomed?</b> Another prediction 
                    I made in <i>The Age of Intelligent Machines</i> was that 
                    once computers did perform as well or better as humans in 
                    chess, we would either think more of computer intelligence, 
                    less of human intelligence, or less of chess, and that if 
                    <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is a guide, the last of these would be the likely 
                    outcome. Indeed, that is precisely what happened. Soon after 
                    Deep Blue's victory we began to hear a lot about how chess 
                    is really just a simple game of calculating combinations and 
                    that the computer victory just demonstrated that it was a 
                    better <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>.</p>
<p>The reality is slightly more complex. The ability of humans 
                    to perform well in chess is clearly not due to our calculating 
                    prowess, at which we are in fact rather poor. We use instead 
                    a quintessentially human form of judgment. For this type of 
                    qualitative judgment, Deep Fritz represents genuine progress 
                    over earlier systems. (Incidentally, humans have made no progress 
                    in the last five years, with the top human scores remaining 
                    just below 2,800. Kasparov is rated at 2,795 and Kramnik at 
                    2,794.)</p>
<p>Where we go from here? Now that computer chess is relying 
                    on software running on ordinary personal computers, chess 
                    programs will continue to benefit from the ongoing acceleration 
                    of computer power. By 2009 a program like Deep Fritz will 
                    again achieve Deep Blue's ability to analyze two hundred million 
                    board positions per second. With the opportunity to harvest 
                    computation on the Internet, we will be able to achieve this 
                    potential several years sooner than 2009. (Internet harvesting 
                    of computers will require more ubiquitous <a class="thought" href="entries/broadband_entry.html">broadband</a> communication, 
                    but that's coming, too).</p>
<p>With these inevitable speed increases, as well as ongoing 
                    improvements in pattern recognition, computer chess ratings 
                    will continue to edge higher. Deep Fritz&#8211;like programs 
                    running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat 
                    all humans later in this decade. Then we'll really lose interest 
                    in chess.</p>

<p><b>Combining methods.</b> The most powerful approach to building 
              robust AI systems is to combine approaches, which is how the human 
              brain works. As we discussed, the brain is not one big neural net 
              but instead consists of hundreds of regions, each of which is optimized 
              for processing information in a different way. None of these regions 
              by itself operates at what we would consider human levels of performance, 
              but clearly by definition the overall system does exactly that.</p>
<p>I've used this approach in my own AI work, especially in pattern 
              recognition. In speech recognition, for example, we implemented 
              a number of different pattern-recognition systems based on different 
              paradigms. Some were specifically programmed with knowledge of phonetic 
              and linguistic constraints from experts. Some were based on rules 
              to parse sentences (which involves creating sentence diagrams showing 
              word usage, similar to the diagrams taught in grade school). Some 
              were based on self-organizing techniques, such as Markov models, 
              trained on extensive libraries of recorded and annotated human speech. 
              We then programmed a software "expert manager" to learn the strengths 
              and weaknesses of the different "experts" (recognizers) and combine 
              their results in optimal ways. In this fashion, a particular technique 
              that by itself might produce unreliable results can nonetheless 
              contribute to increasing the overall accuracy of the system.</p>
<p>There are many intricate ways to combine the varied methods in 
              AI's toolbox. For example, one can use a genetic algorithm to evolve 
              the optimal topology (organization of nodes and connections) for 
              a neural net or a Markov model. The final output of the GA-evolved 
              neural net can then be used to control the parameters of a recursive 
              search algorithm. We can add in powerful signal- and image-processing 
              techniques that have been developed for pattern-processing systems. 
              Each specific application calls for a different architecture. Computer 
              science professor and AI <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> Ben Goertzel has written a 
              series of books and articles that describe strategies and architectures 
              for combining the diverse methods underlying intelligence. His "Novamente" 
              architecture is intended to provide a framework for general purpose 
              AI.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>The above basic descriptions provide only a glimpse into how increasingly 
              sophisticated current AI systems are designed. It's beyond the scope 
              of this book to provide a comprehensive description of the techniques 
              of AI, and even a doctoral program in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> is unable 
              to cover all of the varied approaches in use today.</p>
<p>Many of the examples of real-world narrow AI systems described 
              in the next section use a variety of methods integrated and optimized 
              for each particular task. Narrow AI is strengthening as a result 
              of several concurrent trends: continued exponential gains in computational 
              resources, extensive real-world experience with thousands of applications, 
              and fresh insights into how the human brain makes intelligent decisions.</p>
<h2>A Narrow AI Sampler</h2>
<p>When I wrote my first AI book, <i>The Age of Intelligent Machines</i> 
              in the late 1980s, I had to conduct extensive investigations to 
              find a few successful examples of AI in practice. The Internet was 
              not yet prevalent, so I had to go to real libraries and visit the 
              AI research centers in the United States, Europe, and Asia. I included 
              in my book pretty much all of the reasonable examples I could identify. 
              In my research for this book my experience has been altogether different. 
              I have been inundated with thousands of compelling examples. In 
              our reporting on the KurzweilAI.net Web site, we feature several 
              dramatic systems every day.<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>A 2003 study by Business Communication Company projected a $21 
              billion market by 2007 for AI applications, with average annual 
              growth of 12.2 percent from 2002 to 2007.<sup>25</sup> Leading industries 
              for AI applications include business intelligence, customer relations, 
              finance, defense and domestic security, and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. Here is a 
              small sample of narrow AI in action.</p>
<p><b>Military and intelligence.</b> The U.S. military has been an 
              avid user of AI systems. Pattern-recognition software systems guide 
              autonomous <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s such as cruise missiles, which can fly thousands 
              of miles to find a specific building or even a specific window.<sup>26</sup> 
              Although the relevant details of the terrain that the missile flies 
              over are programmed ahead of time, variations in weather, ground 
              cover, and other factors require a flexible level of real-time image 
              recognition.</p>
<p>The army has developed prototypes of self-organizing communication 
              networks (called "mesh networks") to automatically configure many 
              thousands of communication nodes when a platoon is dropped into 
              a new location.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>Expert systems incorporating Bayesian networks and GAs are used 
              to optimize complex supply chains that coordinate millions of provisions, 
              supplies, and weapons based on rapidly changing battlefield requirements.</p>
<p>AI systems are routinely employed to simulate the performance of 
              weapons, including nuclear bombs and missiles.</p>
<p>Advance warning of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was 
              apparently detected by the National Security Agency's AI-based Echelon 
              system, which analyzes the agency's extensive monitoring of communications 
              traffic.<sup>28</sup> Unfortunately, Echelon's warnings were not 
              reviewed by human agents until it was too late.</p>
<p>The 2002 military campaign in Afghanistan saw the debut of the 
              armed Predator, an unmanned robotic flying fighter. Although the 
              Air Force's Predator had been under development for many years, 
              arming it with Army-supplied missiles was a last-minute improvisation 
              that proved remarkably successful. In the Iraq war that began in 
              2003 the armed Predator (operated by the CIA) and other flying unmanned 
              aerial vehicles (UAVs) destroyed thousands of enemy tanks and missile 
              sites.</p>
<p>All of the military services are using robots. The army utilizes 
              them to search caves (in Afghanistan) and buildings. The navy uses 
              small robotic ships to protect its aircraft carriers. As I discuss 
              in chapter 6 of <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, moving soldiers 
              away from battle is a rapidly growing trend.</p>
<p><b><a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> exploration.</b> <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> is building self-understanding into 
              the software controlling its unmanned spacecraft. Because Mars is 
              about three <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-minutes from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, and Jupiter around forty light-minutes 
              (depending on the exact position of the planets), communication 
              between spacecraft headed there and earthbound controllers is significantly 
              delayed. For this reason it's important that the software controlling 
              these missions have the capability of performing its own tactical 
              decision making. To accomplish this NASA software is being designed 
              to include a model of the software's own capabilities and those 
              of the spacecraft, as well as the challenges each mission is likely 
              to encounter. Such AI-based systems are capable of reasoning through 
              new situations rather than just following preprogrammed rules. This 
              approach enabled the craft Deep Space One in 1999 to use its own 
              technical knowledge to devise a series of original plans to overcome 
              a stuck <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> that threatened to destroy its mission of exploring 
              an asteroid.<sup>29</sup> The AI system's first plan failed to work, 
              but its second plan saved the mission. "These systems have a commonsense 
              model of the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of their internal <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s," explains Brian 
              Williams, coinventor of Deep Space One's autonomous software and 
              now a scientist at MIT's Space Systems and AI laboratories. "[The 
              spacecraft] can reason from that model to determine what is wrong 
              and to know how to act."</p>
<p>Using a network of computers NASA used GAs to evolve an antenna 
              design for three Space Technology 5 satellites that will study the 
              Earth's magnetic field. Millions of possible designs competed in 
              the simulated evolution. According to NASA scientist and project 
              leader Jason Lohn, "We are now using the [GA] software to design 
              tiny microscopic machines, including gyroscopes, for spaceflight 
              navigation. The software also may invent designs that no human designer 
              would ever think of."<sup>30</sup></p>
<p>Another NASA AI system learned on its own to distinguish stars 
              from galaxies in very faint images with an accuracy surpassing that 
              of human astronomers.</p>
<p>New land-based robotic telescopes are able to make their own decisions 
              on where to look and how to optimize the likelihood of finding desired 
              phenomena. Called "autonomous, semi-intelligent observatories," 
              the systems can adjust to the weather, notice items of interest, 
              and decide on their own to track them. They are able to detect very 
              subtle phenomena, such as a <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> blinking for a nanosecond, which 
              may indicate a small asteroid in the outer regions of our solar 
              system passing in front of the light from that star.<sup>31</sup> 
              One such system, called Moving Object and <a class="thought" href="entries/transient_entry.html">Transient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">Event</a> Search 
              System (MOTESS) has identified on its own 180 new asteroids and 
              several comets during its first two years of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>. "We have 
              an intelligent observing system," explained University of Exeter 
              astronomer Alasdair Allan. "It thinks and reacts for itself, deciding 
              whether something it has discovered is interesting enough to need 
              more observations. If more observations are needed, it just goes 
              ahead and gets them."</p>
<p>Similar systems are used by the military to automatically analyze 
              data from spy satellites. Current satellite technology is capable 
              of observing ground-level features about an inch in size and is 
              not affected by bad weather, clouds, or darkness.<sup>32</sup> The 
              massive amount of data continually generated would not be manageable 
              without automated image recognition programmed to look for relevant 
              developments.</p>

              of imaging data.</p>
<p>Every major drug developer is using AI programs to do pattern recognition 
              and intelligent data mining in the development of new drug therapies. 
              For example <a class="thought" href="entries/sri_entry.html">SRI</a> International is building flexible knowledge bases 
              that encode everything we know about a dozen disease agents, including 
              tuberculosis and <i>H. pylori</i> (the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> that cause ulcers).<sup>34</sup> 
              The goal is to apply intelligent data-mining tools (software that 
              can search for new relationships in data) to find new ways to kill 
              or disrupt the metabolisms of these <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s.</p>
<p>Similar systems are being applied to performing the automatic discovery 
              of new therapies for other diseases, as well as understanding the 
              function of genes and their roles in disease.<sup>35</sup> For example 
              Abbott Laboratories claims that six human researchers in one of 
              its new labs equipped with AI-based robotic and data-analysis systems 
              are able to match the results of two hundred scientists in its older 
              drug-development labs.<sup>36</sup></p>
<p>Men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels typically 
              undergo surgical biopsy, but about 75 percent of these men do not 
              have prostate cancer. A new test, based on pattern recognition of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s in the blood, would reduce this false positive rate to 
              about 29 percent.<sup>37</sup> The test is based on an AI program 
              designed by Correlogic Systems in Bethesda, Maryland, and the accuracy 
              is expected to improve further with continued development.</p>
<p>Pattern recognition applied to protein patterns has also been used 
              in the detection of ovarian cancer. The best contemporary test for 
              ovarian cancer, called CA-125, employed in combination with ultrasound, 
              misses almost all early-stage tumors. "By the time it is now diagnosed, 
              ovarian cancer is too often deadly," says Emanuel Petricoin III, 
              codirector of the Clinical Proteomics Program run by the FDA and 
              the National Cancer Institute. Petricoin is the lead developer of 
              a new AI-based test looking for unique patterns of proteins found 
              only in the presence of cancer. In an evaluation involving hundreds 
              of blood samples, the test was, according to Petricoin, "an astonishing 
              100% accurate in detecting cancer, even at the earliest stages."<sup>38</sup></p>
<p>About 10 percent of all Pap-smear slides in the United States are 
              analyzed by a self-learning AI program called FocalPoint, developed 
              by TriPath Imaging. The developers started out by interviewing pathologists 
              on the criteria they use. The AI system then continued to learn 
              by watching expert pathologists. Only the best human diagnosticians 
              were allowed to be observed by the program. "That's the advantage 
              of an expert system," explains Bob Schmidt, TriPath's technical 
              product manager. "It allows you to replicate your very best people."</p>
<p>Ohio State University Health System has developed a computerized 
              physician order-entry (CPOE) system based on an expert system with 
              extensive knowledge across multiple specialties.<sup>39</sup> The 
              system automatically checks every order for possible allergies in 
              the patient, drug interactions, duplications, drug restrictions, 
              dosing guidelines, and appropriateness given information about the 
              patient from the hospital's laboratory and radiology departments.</p>
<p><b>Science and math.</b> A "<a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> scientist" has been developed 
              at the University of Wales that combines an AI-based system capable 
              of formulating original theories, a robotic system that can automatically 
              carry out experiments, and a reasoning engine to evaluate results. 
              The researchers provided their creation with a model of gene <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> 
              in yeast. The system "automatically originates hypotheses to explain 
              observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically 
              runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results 
              to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats 
              the cycle."<sup>40</sup> The system is capable of improving its 
              performance by learning from its own experience. The experiments 
              designed by the robot scientist were three times less expensive 
              than those designed by human scientists. A test of the machine against 
              a group of human scientists showed that the discoveries made by 
              the machine were comparable to those made by the humans.</p>
<p>Mike Young, director of biology at the University of Wales, was 
              one of the human scientists who lost to the machine. He explains 
              that "the robot did beat me, but only because I hit the wrong key 
              at one point."</p>
<p>A long-standing conjecture in <a class="thought" href="entries/algebra_entry.html">algebra</a> was finally proved by an 
              AI system at Argonne National Laboratory. Human mathematicians called 
              the proof "creative."</p>
<p><b>Business, finance, and manufacturing.</b> Companies in every 
              industry are using AI systems to control and optimize logistics, 
              detect fraud and money laundering, and perform intelligent data 
              mining on the horde of information they gather each day. Wal-Mart, 
              for example, gathers vast amounts of information from its transactions 
              with shoppers. AI-based tools using neural nets and expert systems 
              review this data to provide market-research reports for managers. 
              This intelligent data mining allows them to make remarkably accurate 
              predictions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>y required for each product in each store 
              for each day.<sup>41</sup></p>
<p>AI-based programs are routinely used to detect fraud in financial 
              transactions. Future Route, an English company, for example, offers 
              iHex, based on AI routines developed at Oxford University, to detect 
              fraud in credit-card transactions and loan applications.<sup>42</sup> 
              The system continuously generates and updates its own rules based 
              on its experience. First Union Home Equity Bank in Charlotte, North 
              Carolina, uses Loan Arranger, a similar AI-based system to decide 
              whether to approve mortgage applications.<sup>43</sup></p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/nasdaq_entry.html">NASDAQ</a> similarly uses a learning program called the Securities 
              Observation, News Analysis, and Regulation (SONAR) system to monitor 
              all trades for fraud as well as the possibility of insider trading.<sup>44</sup> 
              As of the end of 2003 more than 180 incidents had been detected 
              by SONAR and referred to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
              and Department of Justice. These included several cases that later 
              received significant news coverage.</p>
<p>Ascent Technology, founded by Patrick Winston, who directed MIT's 
              AI Lab from 1972 through 1997, has designed an GA-based system called 
              SmartAirport Operations Center (SAOC) that can optimize the complex 
              logistics of an airport, such as balancing work assignments of hundreds 
              of employees, making gate and equipment assignments, and managing 
              a myriad of other details.<sup>45</sup> Winston points out that 
              "figuring out ways to optimize a complicated situation is what genetic 
              algorithms do." SAOC has raised <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> by approximately 30 
              percent in the airports where it has been implemented.</p>
<p>Ascent's first contract was to apply its AI techniques to managing 
              the logistics for the 1991 Desert Storm campaign in Iraq. <a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a> 
              claimed that AI-based logistic-planning systems, including the Ascent 
              system, resulted in more savings than the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> research 
              investment in AI over several decades.<sup>46</sup></p>
<p>A recent trend in software is for AI systems to monitor a complex 
              software system's performance, recognize malfunctions, and determine 
              the best way to recover automatically without necessarily informing 
              the human user. The idea stems from the realization that as software 
              systems become more complex, like humans, they will never be perfect, 
              and that eliminating all bugs is impossible. As humans, we use the 
              same strategy: we don't expect to be perfect, but we usually try 
              to recover from inevitable mistakes. "We want to stand this notion 
              of systems management on its head," says Armando Fox, the head of 
              Stanford University's Software Infrastructures Group, who is working 
              on what is now called "autonomic computing." Fox adds, "The system 
              has to be able to set itself up, it has to optimize itself. It has 
              to repair itself, and if something goes wrong, it has to know how 
              to respond to external threats." IBM, Microsoft, and other software 
              vendors are all developing systems that incorporate autonomic capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Manufacturing and robotics.</b> Computer-integrated manufacturing 
              (CIM) increasingly employs AI techniques to optimize the use of 
              resources, streamline logistics, and reduce inventories through 
              just-in-time purchasing of parts and supplies. A new trend in CIM 
              systems is to use "<a class="thought" href="entries/case_based_reasoning_entry.html">case-based reasoning</a>" rather than hard-coded, 
              rule-based expert systems. Such reasoning codes knowledge as "cases," 
              which are examples of problems with solutions. Initial cases are 
              usually designed by the engineers, but the key to a successful case-based 
              reasoning system is its ability to gather new cases from actual 
              experience. The system is then able to apply the reasoning from 
              its stored cases to new situations.</p>
<p>Robots are extensively used in manufacturing. The latest generation 
              of robots uses flexible AI-based machine-vision systems&#8212;from 
              companies such as Cognex Corporation in Natick, Massachusetts&#8212;that 
              can respond flexibly to varying conditions. This reduces the need 
              for precise setup for the robot to operate correctly. Brian Carlisle, 
              CEO of Adept Technologies, a Livermore, California, factory-<a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a> 
              company, points out that "even if labor costs were eliminated [as 
              a consideration], a strong case can still be made for automating 
              with robots and other flexible automation. In addition to quality 
              and throughput, users gain by enabling rapid product changeover 
              and evolution that can't be matched with hard tooling."</p>
<p>One of AI's leading roboticists, <a class="thought" href="entries/moravec_entry.html">Hans Moravec</a>, has founded a company 
              called Seegrid to apply his machine-vision technology to applications 
              in manufacturing, materials handling, and military missions.<sup>47</sup> 
              Moravec's software enables a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> (a robot or just a material-handling 
              cart) to walk or roll through an unstructured environment and in 
              a single pass build a reliable "voxel" (three-dimensional pixel) 
              map of the environment. The robot can then use the map and its own 
              reasoning ability to determine an optimal and obstacle-free path 
              to carry out its assigned mission.</p>
<p>This technology enables autonomous carts to transfer materials 
              throughout a manufacturing process without the high degree of preparation 
              required with conventional preprogrammed robotic systems. In military 
              situations autonomous vehicles could carry out precise missions 
              while adjusting to rapidly changing environments and battlefield 
              conditions.</p>
<p>Machine vision is also improving the ability of robots to interact 
              with humans. Using small, inexpensive cameras, head- and eye-tracking 
              software can <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> where a human user is, allowing robots, as well 
              as virtual personalities on a screen, to maintain eye contact, a 
              key <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> for natural interactions. Head- and eye-tracking systems 
              have been developed at Carnegie Mellon University and MIT and are 
              offered by small companies such as Seeing Machines of Australia.</p>
<p>An impressive demonstration of machine vision was a vehicle that 
              was driven by an AI system with no human intervention for almost 
              the entire distance from Washington, D.C., to San Diego.<sup>48</sup> 
              Bruce Buchanan, computer-science professor at the University of 
              Pittsburgh and president of the American Association of Artificial 
              Intelligence, pointed out that this feat would have been "unheard 
              of 10 years ago."</p>
<p>Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is developing a swarm of robots 
              that can navigate in complex environments, such as a disaster zone, 
              and find items of interest, such as humans who may be injured. In 
              a September 2004 demonstration at an AI conference in San Jose, 
              they demonstrated a group of self-organizing robots on a mock but 
              realistic disaster area.<sup>49</sup> The robots moved over the 
              rough terrain, communicated with one another, used pattern recognition 
              on images, and detected body heat to locate humans.</p>
<p><b>Speech and language.</b> Dealing naturally with language is 
              the most challenging task of all for artificial intelligence. No 
              simple tricks, short of fully mastering the principles of human 
              intelligence, will allow a computerized system to convincingly emulate 
              human <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>, even if restricted to just text messages. This 
              was Turing's enduring insight in designing his eponymous test based 
              entirely on written language..</p>
<p>Although not yet at human levels, natural language-processing systems 
              are making solid progress. <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">Search engine</a>s have become so popular 
              that "<a class="thought" href="entries/google_entry.html">Google</a>" has gone from a proper noun to a common verb, and 
              its technology has revolutionized research and access to knowledge. 
              Google and other search engines use AI-based statistical-learning 
              methods and logical inference to determine the ranking of links. 
              The most obvious failing of these search engines is their inability 
              to understand the context of words. Although an experienced user 
              learns how to design a string of <a class="thought" href="entries/keyword_entry.html">keyword</a>s to find the most relevant 
              sites (for example, a search for "computer <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>" is likely to avoid 
              references to potato chips that a search for "chip" alone might 
              turn up) what we would really like to be able to do is converse 
              with our search engines in natural language. Microsoft has developed 
              a natural-language search engine called Ask MSR (Ask MicroSoft Research), 
              which actually answers natural-language questions such as "When 
              was Mickey Mantle born?"<sup>50</sup> After the system parses the 
              sentence to determine the parts of speech (subject, verb, object, 
              adjective and adverb modifiers, and so on), a special search engine 
              then finds matches based on the parsed sentence. The found documents 
              are searched for sentences that appear to answer the question, and 
              the possible answers are ranked. At least 75 percent of the time, 
              the correct answer is in the top three ranked positions, and incorrect 
              answers are usually obvious (such as "Mickey Mantle was born in 
              3"). The researchers hope to include knowledge bases that will lower 
              the rank of many of the nonsensical answers.</p>
<p>Microsoft researcher Eric Brill, who has led research on Ask MSR, 
              has also attempted an even more difficult task: building a system 
              that provides answers of about fifty words to more complex questions, 
              such as, "How are the recipients of the Nobel Prize selected?" One 
              of the strategies used by this system is to find an appropriate 
              FAQ section on the Web that answers the <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a>.</p>
<p>Natural-language systems combined with large-vocabulary, speaker-independent 
              (that is, responsive to any speaker) speech recognition over the

              You can talk to British Airways' virtual travel <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> about anything 
              you like as long as it has to do with booking flights on British 
              Airways.<sup>51</sup> You're also likely to talk to a virtual person 
              if you call Verizon for customer service or Charles Schwab and Merrill 
              Lynch to conduct financial transactions. These systems, while they 
              can be annoying to some people, are reasonably adept at responding 
              appropriately to the often ambiguous and fragmented way people speak. 
              Microsoft and other companies are offering systems that allow a 
              business to create virtual agents to book reservations for travel 
              and hotels and conduct routine transactions of all kinds through 
              two-way, reasonably natural voice dialogues.</p>
<p>Not every caller is satisfied with the ability of these virtual 
              agents to get the job done, but most systems provide a means to 
              get a human on the line. Companies using these systems report that 
              they reduce the need for human service agents up to 80 percent. 
              Aside from the money saved, reducing the size of call centers has 
              management benefit. Call-center jobs have very high turnover rates 
              because of low job satisfaction.</p>
<p>It's said that men are loath to ask others for directions, but 
              car vendors are betting that both male and female drivers will be 
              willing to ask their own car for help in getting to their destination. 
              In 2005 the Acura RL and Honda Odyssey will be offering a system 
              from IBM that allows users to converse with their cars.<sup>52</sup> 
              Driving directions will include street names (for example, "turn 
              left on Main Street, then right on Second Avenue"). Users can ask 
              such questions as, "Where is the nearest Italian restaurant?" or 
              they can enter specific locations by voice, ask for clarifications 
              on directions, and give commands to the car itself (such as "turn 
              up the air conditioning"). The Acura RL will also track road conditions 
              and highlight traffic congestion on its screen in real time. The 
              speech recognition is claimed to be speaker-independent and to be 
              unaffected by engine sound, wind, and other noises. The system will 
              reportedly recognize 1.7 million street and city names, in addition 
              to nearly one thousand commands.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_language_entry.html">Computer language</a> translation continues to improve gradually. Because 
              this is a Turing-level task&#8212;that is, it requires full human-level 
              understanding of language to perform at human levels&#8212;it will 
              be one of the last application areas to compete with human performance. 
              Franz Josef Och, a computer scientist at the University of Southern 
              California, has developed a technique that can generate a new language-translation 
              system between any pair of languages in a matter of hours or days.<sup>53</sup> 
              All he needs is a "Rosetta stone"&#8212;that is, text in one language 
              and the translation of that text in the other language&#8212;although 
              he needs millions of words of such translated text. Using a self-organizing 
              technique, the system is able to develop its own statistical models 
              of how text is translated from one language to the other and develops 
              these models in both directions.</p>
<p>This contrasts with other translation systems, in which linguists

<p><b>Entertainment and sports.</b> In an amusing and intriguing application 
              of GAs, Oxford scientist Torsten Reil created animated creatures 
              with simulated joints and muscles and a neural net for a brain. 
              He then assigned them a task: to walk. He used a GA to evolve this 
              capability, which involved seven hundred parameters. "If you look 
              at that system with your human eyes, there's no way you can do it 
              on your own, because the system is just too complex," Reil points 
              out. "That's where evolution comes in."<sup>54</sup></p>
<p>While some of the evolved creatures walked in a smooth and convincing 
              way, the research demonstrated a well-known attribute of GAs: you 
              get what you ask for. Some creatures figured out novel new ways 
              of passing for walking. According to Weil, "We got some creatures 
              that didn't walk at all, but had these very strange ways of moving 
              forward: crawling or doing somersaults."</p>

              A team at the University of Florence is working on soccer. This 
              software tracks the location of each player and can determine the 
              type of play being made (such as free kicking or attempting a goal), 
              when a goal is achieved, when a penalty is earned, and other key 
              events.</p>

<p>The AI winter is long since over. We are well into the spring of 
              narrow AI. Most of the examples above were research projects just 
              ten to fifteen years ago. If all the AI systems in the world suddenly 
              stopped functioning, our economic infrastructure would grind to 
              a halt. Your bank would cease doing business. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a> 
              would be crippled. Most communications would fail. This was not 
              the case a decade ago. Of course, our AI systems are not smart enough&#8212;yet&#8212;to 
              organize such a conspiracy.</p>

<p><i>Advancing computer performance is like water slowly flooding 
                the landscape. A half century ago it began to drown the lowlands, 
                driving out human calculators and record clerks, but leaving most 
                of us dry. Now the flood has reached the foothills, and our outposts 
                there are contemplating retreat. We feel safe on our peaks, but, 
                at the present rate, those too will be submerged within another 
                half century. I propose that we build Arks as that day nears, 
                and adopt a seafaring life! For now, though, we must rely on our 
                representatives in the lowlands to tell us what water is really 
                like.</i></p>
<p><i>Our representatives on the foothills of chess and theorem-proving 
                report signs of intelligence. Why didn't we get similar reports 
                decades before, from the lowlands, as computers surpassed humans 
                in arithmetic and rote memorization? Actually, we did, at the 
                time. Computers that calculated like thousands of mathematicians 
                were hailed as "giant brains," and inspired the first 
                generation of AI research. After all, the machines were doing 
                something beyond any animal, that needed human intelligence, concentration 
                and years of training. But it is hard to recapture that magic 
                now. One reason is that computers' demonstrated stupidity in other 
                areas biases our judgment. Another relates to our own ineptitude. 
                We do arithmetic or keep records so painstakingly and externally, 
                that the small mechanical steps in a long calculation are obvious, 
                while the big picture often escapes us. Like Deep Blue's builders, 
                we see the process too much from the inside to appreciate the 
                subtlety that it may have on the outside. But there is a non-obviousness 
                in snowstorms or tornadoes that emerge from the repetitive arithmetic 
                of weather simulations, or in rippling tyrannosaur skin from movie 
                animation calculations. We rarely call it intelligence, but "artificial 
                reality" may be an even more profound <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> than artificial 
                intelligence (Moravec 1998).</i></p>
<p><i>The mental steps underlying good human chess playing and theorem 
                proving are complex and hidden, putting a mechanical interpretation 
                out of reach. Those who can follow the play naturally describe 
                it instead in mentalistic language, using terms like strategy, 
                understanding and <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>. When a machine manages to be simultaneously 
                meaningful and surprising in the same rich way, it too compels 
                a mentalistic interpretation. Of course, somewhere behind the 
                scenes, there are programmers who, in principle, have a mechanical 
                interpretation. But even for them, that interpretation loses its 
                grip as the working program fills its memory with details too 
                voluminous for them to grasp.</i></p>
<p><i>As the rising flood reaches more populated heights, machines 
                will begin to do well in areas a greater number can appreciate. 
                The visceral sense of a thinking presence in machinery will become 
                increasingly widespread. When the highest peaks are covered, there 
                will be machines than can interact as intelligently as any human 
                on any subject. The presence of minds in machines will then become

<p>Because of the exponential nature of progress in information-based 
              technologies, performance often shifts quickly from pathetic to 
              daunting. In many diverse realms, as the examples in the previous 
              section make clear, the performance of narrow AI is already impressive. 
              The range of intelligent tasks in which machines can now compete 
              with human intelligence is continually expanding. In a cartoon in 
              <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i>, a defensive "human race" is 
              seen writing out signs that state what only people (and not machines) 
              can do.<sup>59</sup> Littered on the floor are the signs the human 
              race has already discarded, because machines can now perform these 
              functions: diagnose an electrocardiogram, compose in the style of 
              Bach, recognize faces, guide a missile, play Ping-Pong, play master 
              chess, pick stocks, improvise jazz, prove important theorems, and 
              understand continuous speech. Back in 1999 these tasks were no longer 
              solely the province of human intelligence; machines could do them 
              all.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614001739im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/KurzweilAI50_Image1.jpg"></p>
<p>On the wall behind the man <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>izing the human race were signs 
              he had written out describing the tasks that were still the sole 
              province of humans: have <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>, review a movie, hold press 
              conferences, translate speech, clean a house, and drive cars. If 
              we were to redesign this cartoon in a few years, some of these signs 
              would also be likely to end up on the floor. When CYC reaches one 
              hundred million items of commonsense knowledge, perhaps human superiority 
              in the realm of commonsense reasoning won't be so clear.</p>
<p>The era of household robots, although still fairly primitive today, 
              has already started. Ten years from now, it's likely we will consider 
              "clean a house" as within the capabilities of machines. As for driving 
              cars, robots with no human intervention have already driven nearly 
              across the United States on ordinary roads with other normal traffic. 
              We are not yet ready to turn over all steering wheels to machines, 
              but there are serious proposals to create <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> highways on 
              which cars (with people in them) will drive by themselves.</p>
<p>The three tasks that have to do with human-level understanding 
              of natural language&#8212;reviewing a movie, holding a press conference, 
              and translating speech&#8212;are the most difficult. Once we can 
              take down these signs, we'll have Turing-level machines, and the 
              era of strong AI will have started.</p>
<p>This era will creep up on us. As long as there are any discrepancies 
              between human and machine performance&#8212;areas in which humans 
              outperform machines&#8212;strong AI skeptics will seize on these 
              differences. But our experience in each area of skill and knowledge 
              is likely to follow that of Kasparov. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>s of performance 
              will shift quickly from pathetic to daunting as the knee of the 
              exponential curve is reached for each human capability.</p>
<p>How will strong AI be achieved? Most of the material in this book 
              is intended to lay out the fundamental requirements for both hardware 
              and software and explain why we can be confident that these requirements 
              will be met in nonbiological systems. The continuation of the exponential 
              growth of the price-performance of computation to achieve hardware 
              capable of emulating human intelligence was still controversial 
              in 1999. There has been so much progress in developing the technology 
              for three-dimensional computing over the past five years that relatively 
              few knowledgeable observers now doubt that this will happen. Even 
              just taking the <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> industry's published ITRS road map, 
              which runs to 2018, we can project human-level hardware at reasonable 
              cost by that year.<sup>60</sup></p>
<p>I've stated the case in chapter 4 <i>The Singularity is Near</i> 
              of why we can have confidence that we will have detailed models 
              and simulations of all regions of the human brain by the late 2020s. 
              Until recently, our tools for peering into the brain did not have 
              the spatial and temporal resolution, bandwidth, or price-performance 
              to produce adequate data to create sufficiently detailed models. 
              This is now changing. The emerging generation of scanning and sensing 
              tools can analyze and detect neurons and neural components with 
              exquisite accuracy, while operating in real time.</p>
<p>Future tools will provide far greater resolution and capacity. 
              By the 2020s, we will be able to send scanning and sensing nanobots 
              into the capillaries of the brain to scan it from inside. We've 
              shown the ability to translate the data from diverse sources of 
              brain scanning and sensing into models and computer simulations 
              that hold up well to experimental comparison with the performance 
              of the biological versions of these regions. We already have compelling 
              models and simulations for several important brain regions. As I 
              argued in chapter 4 of <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, it's a conservative 
              projection to expect detailed and realistic models of all brain 
              regions by the late 2020s.</p>
<p>One simple statement of the strong AI scenario is that we will 
              learn the principles of operation of human intelligence from reverse 
              engineering all the brain's regions, and we will apply these principles 
              to the brain-capable computing <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>s that will exist in the 
              2020s. We already have an effective toolkit for narrow AI. Through 
              the ongoing refinement of these methods, the development of new 
              algorithms, and the trend toward combining multiple methods into 
              intricate architectures, narrow AI will continue to become less 
              narrow. That is, AI applications will have broader domains, and 
              their performance will become more flexible. AI systems will develop 
              multiple ways of approaching each problem, just as humans do. Most 
              important, the new insights and paradigms resulting from the acceleration 
              of brain reverse engineering will greatly enrich this set of tools 
              on an ongoing basis. This process is well under way.</p>
<p>It's often said that the brain works differently from a computer, 
              so we cannot apply our insights about brain function into workable 
              nonbiological systems. This view completely ignores the field of 
              self-organizing systems, for which we have a set of increasingly 
              sophisticated mathematical tools. As I discussed in chapter 4 of 
              <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, the brain differs in a number of 
              important ways from that of conventional, contemporary computers. 
              If you open up your Palm Pilot and cut a wire, there's a good chance 
              you will break the machine. Yet we routinely lose many neurons and 
              interneuronal connections with no ill effect, because the brain 
              is self-organizing and relies on distributed patterns in which many 
              specific details are not important.</p>
<p>When we get to the mid- to late 2020s, we will have access to a 
              generation of extremely detailed brain-region models. Ultimately 
              the toolkit will be greatly enriched with these new models and simulations 
              and will encompass a full knowledge of how the brain works. As we 
              apply the toolkit to intelligent tasks, we will draw upon the entire 
              range of tools, some derived directly from brain reverse engineering, 
              some merely inspired by what we know about the brain, and some not 
              based on the brain at all but on decades of AI research.</p>
<p>Part of the brain's strategy is to learn information, rather than 
              having knowledge hard-coded from the start. ("<a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">Instinct</a>" is the term 
              we use to refer to such innate knowledge.) Learning will be an important 
              aspect of AI, as well. In my experience in developing pattern-recognition 
              systems in character recognition, speech recognition, and financial 
              analysis, providing for the AI's education is the most challenging 
              and important part of the engineering. With the accumulated knowledge 
              of human civilization increasingly accessible online, future AIs 
              will have the opportunity to conduct their education by accessing 
              this vast body of information.</p>
<p>The education of AIs will be much faster than that of unenhanced 
              humans. The twenty-year time span required to provide a basic education 
              to biological humans could be compressed into a matter of weeks 
              or less. Also, because nonbiological intelligence can share its 
              patterns of learning and knowledge, only one AI has to master each 
              particular skill. As I pointed out, we trained one set of research 
              computers to understand speech, but then the hundreds of thousands 
              of people who acquired our speech-recognition software had to load 
              only the already trained patterns into their computers.</p>
<p>One of the many skills that nonbiological intelligence will achieve 
              with the completion of the human brain&#8211;reverse engineering 
              project is sufficient mastery of language and shared human knowledge 
              to pass the Turing test. The Turing test is important not so much 
              for its practical significance but rather because it will demarcate 
              a crucial threshold. As I have pointed out, there is no simple means 
              to pass a Turing test, other than to convincingly emulate the flexibility, 
              subtlety, and suppleness of human intelligence. Having captured 
              that capability in our technology, it will then be subject to engineering's 
              ability to concentrate, focus, and amplify it..</p>
<p>Variations of the Turing test have been proposed. The annual Loebner 
              Prize contest awards a bronze prize to the chatterbot (conversational 
              bot) best able to convince human judges that it's human.<sup>61</sup> 
              The criteria for winning the silver prize is based on Turing's original 
              test, and it obviously has yet to be awarded. The gold prize is 
              based on visual and auditory communication. In other words, the 
              AI must have a convincing face and voice, as transmitted over a 
              terminal, and thus it must appear to the human judge as if he or 
              she is interacting with a real person over a videophone. On the 
              face of it, the gold prize sounds more difficult. I've argued that 
              it may actually be easier, because judges may pay less attention 
              to the text portion of the language being communicated and could 
              be distracted by a convincing facial and voice animation. In fact, 
              we already have real-time facial animation, and while it is not 
              quite up to these modified Turing standards, it's reasonably close. 
              We also have very natural-sounding voice <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, which is often 
              confused with recordings of human speech, although more work is 
              needed on prosodics (intonation). We're likely to achieve satisfactory 
              facial animation and voice production sooner than the Turing-level 
              language and knowledge capabilities.</p>
<p>Turing was carefully imprecise in setting the rules for his test, 
              and significant literature has been devoted to the subtleties of 
              establishing the exact procedures for determining how to assess 
              when the Turing test has been passed.<sup>62</sup> In 2002 I negotiated 
              the rules for a Turing-test wager with <a class="thought" href="entries/kapor_entry.html">Mitch Kapor</a> on the Long Now 
              Web site.<sup>63</sup> The question underlying our twenty-thousand-dollar 
              bet, the proceeds of which go to the charity of the winner's choice, 
              was, "Will the Turing test be passed by a machine by 2029?" I said 
              yes, and Kapor said no. It took us months of dialogue to arrive 
              at the intricate rules to implement our wager. Simply defining "machine" 
              and "human," for example, was not a straightforward matter. Is the 
              human judge allowed to have any nonbiological thinking processes 
              in his or her brain? Conversely, can the machine have any biological 
              aspects?</p>
<p>Because the definition of the Turing test will vary from person 
              to person, Turing test-capable machines will not arrive on a single 
              day, and there will be a period during which we will hear claims 
              that machines have passed the threshold. Invariably, these early 
              claims will be debunked by knowledgeable observers, probably including 
              myself. By the time there is a broad consensus that the Turing test 
              has been passed, the actual threshold will have long since been 
              achieved.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/feigenbaum_entry.html">Edward Feigenbaum</a> proposes a variation of the Turing test, which 
              assesses not a machine's ability to pass for human in casual, everyday 
              dialogue but its ability to pass for a scientific expert in a specific 
              field.<sup>64</sup> The Feigenbaum test (FT) may be more significant 
              than the Turing test, because FT-capable machines, being technically 
              proficient, will be capable of improving their own designs. Feigenbaum 
              describes his test in this way:</p>
<p><i>Two players play the FT game. One player is chosen from among 
              the elite practitioners in each of three pre-selected fields of 
              natural science, engineering, or medicine. (The number could be 
              larger, but for this challenge not greater than ten). Let's say 
              we choose the fields from among those covered in the U.S. National 
              Academy.... For example, we could choose astrophysics, computer 
              science, and molecular biology. In each round of the game, the behavior 
              of the two players (elite scientist and computer) is judged by another 
              Academy member in that particular domain of discourse, e.g., an 
              astrophysicist judging astrophysics behavior. Of course the <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> 
              of the players is hidden from the judge as it is in the Turing test. 
              The judge poses problems, asks questions, asks for explanations, 
              theories, and so on&#8212;as one might do with a colleague. Can the 
              human judge choose, at better than chance level, which is his National 
              Academy colleague and which is the computer?</i></p>
<p>Of course Feigenbaum overlooks the possibility that the computer 
              might already be a National Academy colleague, but he is obviously 
              assuming that machines will not yet have invaded institutions that 
              today comprise exclusively biological humans. While it may appear 
              that the FT is more difficult than the Turing test, the entire history 
              of AI reveals that machines started with the skills of professionals 
              and only gradually moved towards the language skills of a child. 
              Early AI systems demonstrated their prowess initially in professional 
              fields such as proving mathematical theorems and diagnosing medical 
              conditions. These early systems would not be able to pass the FT, 
              however, because they do not have the language skills and the flexible 
              ability to model knowledge from different perspectives, which are 
              needed to engage in the professional dialogue inherent in the FT.</p>
<p>This language ability is essentially the same ability needed in 
              the Turing test. Reasoning in many technical fields is not necessarily 
              more difficult than the commonsense reasoning engaged in by most 
              human adults. I would expect that machines will pass the FT, at 
              least in some disciplines, around the same time as they pass the 
              Turing test. Passing the FT in all disciplines is likely to take 
              longer, however. This is why I see the 2030s as a period of consolidation, 
              as machine intelligence rapidly expands its skills and incorporates 
              the vast knowledge bases of our biological human and machine civilization. 
              By the 2040s we will have the opportunity to apply the accumulated 
              knowledge and skills of our civilization to computational platforms 
              that are billions of times more capable than unassisted biological 
              human intelligence.</p>
<p>The advent of strong AI is the most important transformation this 
              century will see. Indeed, it's comparable in importance to the advent 
              of biology itself. It will mean that a creation of biology has finally 
              mastered its own intelligence and discovered means to overcome its 
              limitations. Once the principles of operation of human intelligence 
              are understood, expanding its abilities will be conducted by human 
              scientists and engineers whose own biological intelligence will 
              have been greatly amplified through an intimate merger with nonbiological 
              intelligence. Over time, the nonbiological portion will predominate.</p>
<p>I have discussed aspects of the impact of this transformation throughout 
              <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, which I focus on in chapter 6. Intelligence 
              is the ability to solve problems with limited resources, including 
              limitations of time. The Singularity will be characterized by the 
              rapid cycle of human intelligence&#8212;increasingly nonbiological&#8212; 
              capable of comprehending and leveraging its own powers.</p>

<p>Creating a neural-net solution to a problem involves the 
                    following steps:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Define the input.</li>
<li>Define the topology of the neural net (i.e., the layers 
                      of neurons and the connections between the neurons).</li>
<li> Train the neural net on examples of the problem.</li>
<li>Run the trained neural net to solve new examples of the 
                      problem.</li>
<li>Take your neural-net company public. These steps (except 
                      for the last one) are detailed below:</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Problem Input</b></p>
<p>The problem input to the neural net consists of a series 
                    of numbers. This input can be:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In a visual pattern-recognition system, a two-dimensional 
                      array of numbers representing the pixels of an image; or</li>
<li> In an auditory (e.g., speech) recognition system, a two-dimensional 
                      array of numbers representing a sound, in which the first 
                      dimension represents parameters of the sound (e.g., frequency 
                      components) and the second dimension represents different 
                      points in time; or</li>
<li>In an arbitrary pattern-recognition system, an n-dimensional 
                      array of numbers representing the input pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Defining the Topology</b></p>
<p>To set up the neural net, the architecture of each neuron 
                    consists of: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple inputs in which each input is "connected" to 
                      either the output of another neuron, or one of the input 
                      numbers.</li>
<li>Generally, a single output, which is connected either 
                      to the input of another neuron (which is usually in a higher 
                      layer), or to the final output.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Set up the First Layer of Neurons</i></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Create N<sub>0</sub> neurons in the first layer. For each 
                      of these neurons, "connect" each of the multiple inputs 
                      of the neuron to "points" (i.e., numbers) in the problem 
                      input. These connections can be determined randomly or using 
                      an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolutionary_algorithm_entry.html">evolutionary algorithm</a> (see below).</li>
<li>Assign an initial "synaptic strength" to each connection 
                      created. These weights can start out all the same, can be 
                      assigned randomly, or can be determined in another way (see 
                      below).</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Set up the Additional Layers of Neurons</i></p>
<p>Set up a total of M layers of neurons. For each layer, set 
                    up the neurons in that layer. For layer<sub>i</sub>:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Create N<sub>i</sub> neurons in layer<sub>i</sub>. For 
                      each of these neurons, "connect" each of the multiple inputs 
                      of the neuron to the outputs of the neurons in layer<sub>i&#8211;1</sub> 
                      (see variations below).</li>
<li>Assign an initial "synaptic strength" to each connection 
                      created. These weights can start out all the same, can be 
                      assigned randomly, or can be determined in another way (see 
                      below).</li>
<li>The outputs of the neurons in layerM are the outputs of 
                      the neural net (see variations below).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Recognition Trials</b></p>
<p>How Each Neuron Works Once the neuron is set up, it does 
                    the following for each recognition trial.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Each weighted input to the neuron is computed by multiplying 
                      the output of the other neuron (or initial input) that the 
                      input to this neuron is connected to by the synaptic strength 
                      of that connection.</li>
<li>All of these weighted inputs to the neuron are summed.</li>
<li>If this sum is greater than the firing threshold of this 
                      neuron, then this is neuron is considered to fire and its 
                      output is 1. Otherwise, its output is 0 (see variations 
                      below).</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Do the Following for Each Recognition Trial</i></p>
<p> For each layer, from layer<sub>0</sub> to layer<sub>M</sub>: 
                    For each neuron in the layer:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Sum its weighted inputs (each weighted input = the output 
                      of the other neuron [or initial input] that the input to 
                      this neuron is connected to multiplied by the synaptic strength 
                      of that connection).</li>
<li>If this sum of weighted inputs is greater than the firing 
                      threshold for this neuron, set the output of this neuron 
                      = 1, otherwise set it to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>To Train the Neural Net</i></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Run repeated recognition trials on sample problems.</li>
<li>After each trial, adjust the synaptic strengths of all 
                      the interneuronal connections to improve the performance 
                      of the neural net on this trial (see the discussion below 
                      on how to do this).</li>
<li>Continue this training until the accuracy rate of the 
                      neural net is no longer improving (i.e., reaches an asymptote).</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Key Design Decisions</i></p>
<p>In the simple schema above, the designer of this neural-net 
                    algorithm needs to determine at the outset:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>What the input numbers represent.</li>
<li>The number of layers of neurons.</li>
<li>The number of neurons in each layer. (Each layer does 
                      not necessarily need to have the same number of neurons.)</li>
<li>The number of inputs to each neuron in each layer. The 
                      number of inputs (i.e., interneuronal connections) can also 
                      vary from neuron to neuron and from layer to layer.</li>
<li>The actual "wiring" (i.e., the connections). For each 
                      neuron in each layer, this consists of a list of other neurons, 
                      the outputs of which constitute the inputs to this neuron. 
                      This represents a key design area. There are a number of 
                      possible ways to do this: 
                      <ul>
<li> (i) Wire the neural net randomly; or</li>
<li>(ii) Use an evolutionary algorithm (see below) to 
                          determine an optimal wiring; or</li>
<li>(iii) Use the system designer's best judgment in determining 
                          the wiring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The initial synaptic strengths (i.e., weights) of each 
                      connection. There are a number of possible ways to do this: 
                      <ul>
<li> (i) Set the synaptic strengths to the same value; 
                          or </li>
<li>(ii) Set the synaptic strengths to different random 
                          values; or </li>
<li>(iii) Use an evolutionary algorithm to determine an 
                          optimal set of initial values; or</li>
<li>(iv) Use the system designer's best judgment in determining 
                          the initial values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The firing threshold of each neuron.</li>
<li>Determine the output. The output can be: 
                      <ul>
<li>(i) the outputs of layerM of neurons; or</li>
<li>(ii) the output of a single output neuron, the inputs 
                          of which are the outputs of the neurons in layerM.</li>
<li>(iii) a function of (e.g., a sum of) the outputs of 
                          the neurons in layerM; or</li>
<li>(iv) another function of neuron outputs in multiple 
                          layers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Determine how the synaptic strengths of all the connections 
                      are adjusted during the training of this neural net. This 
                      is a key design decision and is the subject of a great deal 
                      of research and discussion. There are a number of possible 
                      ways to do this: 
                      <ul>
<li>(i) For each recognition trial, increment or decrement 
                          each synaptic strength by a (generally small) fixed 
                          amount so that the neural net's output more closely 
                          matches the correct answer. One way to do this is to 
                          try both incrementing and decrementing and see which 
                          has the more desirable effect. This can be time-consuming, 
                          so other methods exist for making local decisions on 
                          whether to increment or decrement each synaptic strength.</li>
<li>(ii) Other statistical methods exist for modifying 
                          the synaptic strengths after each recognition trial 
                          so that the performance of the neural net on that trial 
                          more closely matches the correct answer. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that neural-net training will work even if the answers 
                    to the training trials are not all correct. This allows using 
                    real-world training data that may have an inherent error rate. 
                    One key to the success of a neural net&#8211;based recognition 
                    system is the amount of data used for training. Usually a 
                    very substantial amount is needed to obtain satisfactory results. 
                    Just like human students, the amount of time that a neural 
                    net spends learning its lessons is a key factor in its performance.</p>
<p><b>Variations </b></p>
<p>Many variations of the above are feasible: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>There are different ways of determining the topology. 
                      In particular, the interneuronal wiring can be set either 
                      randomly or using an evolutionary algorithm.</li>
<li>There are different ways of setting the initial synaptic 
                      strengths.</li>
<li>The inputs to the neurons in layer<sub>i</sub> do not 
                      necessarily need to come from the outputs of the neurons 
                      in layer<sub>i&#8211;1</sub>. Alternatively, the inputs to 
                      the neurons in each layer can come from any lower layer 
                      or any layer.</li>
<li>There are different ways to determine the final output.</li>
<li>The method described above results in an "all or nothing" 
                      (1 or 0) firing called a nonlinearity. There are other nonlinear 
                      functions that can be used. Commonly a function is used 
                      that goes from 0 to 1 in a rapid but more gradual fashion. 
                      Also, the outputs can be numbers other than 0 and 1.</li>
<li>The different methods for adjusting the synaptic strengths 
                      during training represent key design decisions. The above 
                      schema describes a "synchronous" neural net, in which each 
                      recognition trial proceeds by computing the outputs of each 
                      layer, starting with layer0 through layer<sub>M</sub>. In 
                      a true parallel system, in which each neuron is operating 
                      independently of the others, the neurons can operate "asynchronously" 
                      (i.e., independently). In an asynchronous approach, each 
                      neuron is constantly scanning its inputs and fires whenever 
                      the sum of its weighted inputs exceeds its threshold (or 
                      whatever its output function specifies).</li>

<p><b>19</b> Here is the basic schema for a genetic (evolutionary)

              system needs to provide certain critical parameters and methods, 
              detailed below.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">

<p><b>The Evolutionary Algorithm </b></p>
<p>Create N solution "creatures". Each one has:</p>
<ul>
<li> A genetic code: a sequence of numbers that characterize 
                      a possible solution to the problem. The numbers can represent 
                      critical parameters, steps to a solution, rules, etc.</li>
<li>For each generation of evolution, do the following:</li>
<li>Do the following for each of the N solution creatures:</li>
<li>Apply this solution creature's solution (as represented 
                      by its genetic code) to the problem, or simulated environment. 
                      Rate the solution.</li>
<li>Pick the L solution creatures with the highest ratings 
                      to survive into the next generation.</li>
<li>Eliminate the (N&#8211;L) nonsurviving solution creatures.</li>
<li>Create (N&#8211;L) new solution creatures from the L surviving 
                      solution creatures by:</li>
</ul>
<p>(i) Making copies of the L surviving creatures. Introduce 
                    small random variations into each copy; or </p>
<p>(ii) Create additional solution creatures by combining parts 
                    of the genetic code (using "sexual" reproduction, or otherwise 
                    combining portions of the chromosomes) from the L surviving 
                    creatures; or </p>
<p>(iii) Doing a combination of (i) and (ii).</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether or not to continue evolving: Improvement 
                      = (highest rating in this generation)&#8211;(highest rating 
                      in the previous generation). If Improvement &lt; Improvement 
                      Threshold then we're done.</li>
<li>The solution creature with the highest rating from the 
                      last generation of evolution has the best solution. Apply 
                      the solution defined by its genetic code to the problem.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Key Design Decisions </b></p>
<p>In the simple schema above, the designer needs to determine 
                    at the outset:<br>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Key parameters: 
                      <ul>
<li>N</li>
<li> L</li>
<li> Improvement threshold</li>
</ul>
<li>What the numbers in the genetic code represent and how 
                      the solution is computed from the genetic code.</li>
<li>A method for determining the N solution creatures in the 
                      first generation. In general, these need only be "reasonable" 
                      attempts at a solution. If these first-generation solutions 
                      are too far afield, the evolutionary algorithm may have 
                      difficulty converging on a good solution. It is often worthwhile 
                      to create the initial solution creatures in such a way that 
                      they are reasonably diverse. This will help prevent the 
                      evolutionary process from just finding a "locally" optimal 
                      solution.</li>
<li>How the solutions are rated.</li>
<li>How the surviving solution creatures reproduce. </li>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Variations </b></p>
<p>Many variations of the above are feasible. For example:<br>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>There does not need to be a fixed number of surviving 
                      solutions creatures (L) from each generation. The survival 
                      rule(s) can allow for a variable number of survivors.</li>
<li>There does not need to be a fixed number of new solution 
                      creatures created in each generation (N&#8211;L). The procreation 
                      rules can be independent of the size of the population. 
                      Procreation can be related to survival, thereby allowing 
                      the fittest solution creatures to procreate the most.</li>
<li>The decision as to whether or not to continue evolving 
                      can be varied. It can consider more than just the highest-rated 
                      solution creature from the most recent generation(s). It 
                      can also consider a trend that goes beyond just the last 
                      two generations</li>

<p><b>21</b> Here is the basic scheme (algorithm description) of recursive 
              search. Many variations are possible, and the designer of the system 
              needs to provide certain critical parameters and methods, detailed 
              below.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">

<p><b>The Recursive Algorithm</b></p>
<p>Define a function (program) "Pick Best Next Step." The function 
                    returns a value of "SUCCESS" (we've solved the problem) or 
                    "FAILURE" (we didn't solve it). If it returns with a value 
                    of SUCCESS, then the function also returns the sequence of 
                    steps that solved the problem. Pick Best Next Step does the 
                    following:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Determine if the program can escape from continued recursion 
                      at this point. This bullet, and the next two bullets deal 
                      with this escape decision. First, determine if the problem 
                      has now been solved. Since this call to Pick Best Next Step 
                      probably came from the program calling itself, we may now 
                      have a satisfactory solution. Examples are: 
                      <ul>
<li>(i) In the context of a game (for example, chess), 
                          the last move allows us to win (such as checkmate). 
                        </li>
<li>(ii) In the context of solving a mathematical theorem, 
                          the last step proves the theorem. </li>
<li>(iii) In the context of an artistic program (for example, 
                          a computer poet or composer), the last step matches 
                          the goals for the next word or note.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the problem has been satisfactorily solved, the program 
                    returns with a value of "SUCCESS" and the sequence of steps 
                    that caused the success.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<p>If the problem has not been solved, determine if a solution 
                      is now hopeless. Examples are: 
                    <ul>
<li>(i) In the context of a game (such as chess), this move 
                        causes us to lose (checkmate for the other side). </li>
<li>(ii) In the context of solving a mathematical theorem, 
                        this step violates the theorem. </li>
<li>(iii) In the context of an artistic creation, this step 
                        violates the goals for the next word or note.</li>
</ul>
<li>If the solution at this point has been deemed hopeless, 
                      the program returns with a value of "FAILURE."</li>
<li>If the problem has been neither solved nor deemed hopeless 
                      at this point of recursive expansion, determine whether 
                      or not the expansion should be abandoned anyway. This is 
                      a key aspect of the design and takes into consideration 
                      the limited amount of computer time we have to spend. Examples 
                      are: 
                      <ul>
<li>(i) In the context of a game (such as chess), this 
                          move puts our side sufficiently "ahead" or "behind." 
                          Making this determination may not be straightforward 
                          and is the primary design decision. However, simple 
                          approaches (such as adding up piece values) can still 
                          provide good results. If the program determines that 
                          our side is sufficiently ahead, then Pick Best Next 
                          Step returns in a similar manner to a determination 
                          that our side has won (that is, with a value of "SUCCESS"). 
                          If the program determines that our side is sufficiently 
                          behind, then Pick Best Next Step returns in a similar 
                          manner to a determination that our side has lost (that 
                          is, with a value of "FAILURE").</li>
<li>(ii) In the context of solving a mathematical theorem, 
                          this step involves determining if the sequence of steps 
                          in the proof is unlikely to yield a proof. If so, then 
                          this path should be abandoned, and Pick Best Next Step 
                          returns in a similar manner to a determination that 
                          this step violates the theorem (that is, with a value 
                          of "FAILURE"). There is no "soft" equivalent of success. 
                          We can't return with a value of "SUCCESS" until we have 
                          actually solved the problem. That's the nature of math.</li>
<li>(iii) In the context of an artistic program (such 
                          as a computer poet or composer), this step involves 
                          determining if the sequence of steps (such as the words 
                          in a poem, notes in a song) is unlikely to satisfy the 
                          goals for the next step. If so, then this path should 
                          be abandoned, and Pick Best Next Step returns in a similar 
                          manner to a determination that this step violates the 
                          goals for the next step (that is, with a value of "FAILURE").</li>
</ul>
</li>
</p></ul>
<ul>
<li>If Pick Best Next Step has not returned (because the program 
                      has neither determined success nor failure nor made a determination 
                      that this path should be abandoned at this point), then 
                      we have not escaped from continued recursive expansion. 
                      In this case, we now generate a list of all possible next 
                      steps at this point. This is where the precise statement 
                      of the problem comes in: 
                      <ul>
<li>(i) In the context of a game (such as chess), this 
                          involves generating all possible moves for "our" side 
                          for the current state of the board. This involves a 
                          straightforward codification of the rules of the game. 
                        </li>
<li>(ii) In the context of finding a proof for a mathematical 
                          theorem, this involves listing the possible axioms or 
                          previously proved theorems that can be applied at this 
                          point in the solution. </li>
<li>(iii) In the context of a cybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> program, 
                          this involves listing the possible words/notes/line 
                          segments that could be used at this point. For each 
                          such possible next step: 
                          <ul>
<li>(i) Create the hypothetical situation that would 
                              exist if this step were implemented. In a game, 
                              this means the hypothetical state of the board. 
                              In a mathematical proof, this means adding this 
                              step (for example, axiom) to the proof. In an art 
                              program, this means, adding this word/note/line 
                              segment. </li>
<li>(ii) Now call Pick Best Next Step to examine this 
                              hypothetical situation. This is, of course, where 
                              the recursion comes in because the program is now 
                              calling itself. </li>
<li>(iii) If the above call to Pick Best Next Step 
                              returns with a value of "SUCCESS," then return from 
                              the call to Pick Best Next Step (that we are now 
                              in) also with a value of "SUCCESS." Otherwise consider 
                              the next possible step.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all the possible next steps have been considered 
                            without finding a step that resulted in a return from 
                            the call to Pick Best Next Step with a value of "SUCCESS," 
                            then return from this call to Pick Best Next Step 
                            (that we are now in) with a value of "FAILURE." </p>
<p>END OF PICK BEST NEXT STEP</p>
<p>If the original call to Pick Best Next Move returns 
                            with a value of "SUCCESS," it will also return the 
                            correct sequence of steps: </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<ul>
<li>(i) In the context of a game, the first step in this 
                        sequence is the next move you should make. </li>
<li>(ii) In the context of a mathematical proof, the full 
                        sequence of steps is the proof. </li>
<li>(iii) In the context of a cybernetic art program, the 
                        sequence of steps is your work of art.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the original call to Pick Best Next Step is "FAILURE," 
                      then you need to go back to the drawing board.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Key Design Decisions</b></p>
<p>In the simple schema above, the designer of the recursive 
                      algorithm needs to determine the following at the outset: 
                    </p>
</p></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The key to a recursive algorithm is the determination 
                      in Pick Best Next Step of when to abandon the recursive 
                      expansion. This is easy when the program has achieved clear 
                      success (such as checkmate in chess or the requisite solution 
                      in a math or combinatorial problem) or clear failure. It 
                      is more difficult when a clear win or loss has not yet been 
                      achieved. Abandoning a line of inquiry before a well-defined 
                      outcome is necessary because otherwise the program might 
                      run for billions of years (or at least until the warranty 
                      on your computer runs out).</li>
<li>The other primary requirement for the recursive algorithm 
                      is a straightforward codification of the problem. In a game 
                      like chess, that's easy. But in other situations, a clear 
                      definition of the problem is not always so easy to come 
                      by</li>
</ul>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>If we were to build a very powerful AI machine using the tools listed in the AI Toolkit; expert systems, Bayesian nets, Markov models, neural nets, genetic algorithms, and recursive searching, we might have a machine that could fool a turning test, but it would not have any self awareness, creative intuition, or the ability to think outside the box. (pun intended!)
<br>
I think it is time to take a closer look at the work of Harold Cohen and other generative artists who might have ideas about finding creativity in a machine. Artistic creativity does not come from a paradigm that narrows down knowledge with some end result in mind, it comes from a random thought that is captured and developed. The AI Toolkit can be applied to developing creative ideas but the spark has to come from unpredictable events.
<br>
I believe that research in this area could lead to a machine intelligence that will someday be self aware and have a free will. Then a machine will pass the Turing test with honor instead of being a programmed imitation of intelligence.

<br>
<br>
As far as invoking Self-awareness or True Consciousness in machines/Web is concerned, no one can give any time limit for that although it's inevitable. Because it's not only a matter of intense human efforts but it's pre-determined by Will and Intellgence of the Universe and embedded in its Cosmic Evolution. 
<br>
<br>
But it's highly probable that we may able build a self-aware Web/Network/Machines within 10 to 25 years.It won't be algorithmic in the sense we are familiar with the term in computer science and technology but it will grow and manifest its self-awareness and other higher-order capabilities in months and years after its birth/launch.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I would be interested in Ray's view of the spiritual capacities of the spiritual machines (strong AI) he is talking about.
<br>
<br>
For example, deep states of meditation are states in which the human mind is tacidly aware of its own presence, or even tacidly aware of its direct environment (similar to athletes experiencing "flow"), while all thought-processes have stopped.
<br>
<br>
The mind is still, in abeyance. But consciousness is not in abeyance, on the contrary, there's a strong sense of being, of precence.
<br>
<br>
I do not know how this state could be objectively tested, but maybe someone will be able to devise a Spiritual Test, not just a mental test like the Turing and Feigenbaum tests. These are tests that assess the development of mind, our level of thinking.
<br>
<br>
A machine can respond to and even interact intelligently with its environment, but will it be able to answer not just intellectually, the questions Who am I or What is consciousness?
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that a truly intelligent and spiritual machine will inately have a longing to explore these questions and have them answered.
<br>
<br>
Will machines, once they awaken to true intelligence (strong AI), have a natural desire to answer these spiritual questions?
<br>
<br>
Will a new generation of (machine-)philosophers or rather, (machine-)Buddhists be born?
<br>
<br>
My Spiritual Test for strong AI would be simply to see if these - for humans quite natural - spiritual questions 'spontanuously' arise in our intelligent machines.
<br>
<br>
Are they even interested in spirituality, are they even interested in ethics, humanist thought, or practicing compassion?
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that a truly intelligent machine should demonstrate a natural concern for these things. Otherwise "intelligence" would mean cleverness, rather than intelligence.

Don't forget that in your mind as well as the minds of others there's a lifetime's worth of meta data wrought by experience. The meta data is what forms and guides an entity's ethics, etc.
<br>
<br>
The answer to what concerns a superAI would have depend completely on what kind of meta data you feed or make available to its engine. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>We need something like a Turing Test because we want to transfer human intelligence and consciousness to a platform that is more stable and expandable than our biology.
<br>
<br>
The question is what human intelligence and consciousness are, in essence.
<br>
<br>
This is what we are trying to capture in for example the Turing Test.
<br>
<br>
When we've created Strong AI, a machine that is self-aware and intelligent like humans, we will have trancended many limitations that come with being biologically human.
<br>
<br>
In principle this is something we want, we want to trancend our limitations, and copying intelligence to a more solid (silicon) platform will in theory increase the chances of survival of human civilisation.
<br>
<br>
Either way, it seems that the advance of technology is an evolutionary imperative: we can hardly avoid it, even if we wanted to avoid it.
<br>
<br>
In short, passing the Turing Test would mean that a computer does not just utter some words but is capable of intelligent conversation. Therefor we would presume that this machine has actually achieved true intelligence and is not just faking it.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I agree we need a Turing Test because it offers a benchmark in respect to how convincing an artificial intelligence seems.  Also, you're quite correct that the essential questions regard what intelligence and conciousness are.
<br>
<br>
However, I fear in the relevance of the issues we discuss we've neglected an overarching principle of conciousness, specifically that nobody has the authority to identify conciousness.  I'm no skeptic, but it's worth noting that as far as I'm concerned, it's logically possible everyone in the world is a "machine" not deserving the title of conciousness.
<br>
<br>
In my personal opinion, there's a more valid "Sistine Chapel Creation of Adam Test" whereby the first concious machine is the first one to generate the notion that we are fundamentally isolated-- that it has no more reason to be convinced of our conciousness than we of its.
<br>
<br>
I admit that I agree with jack d, it's entirely possible to have a convincing conversation with an artifical intelligence with no capability for self-awareness, and that this would be less valid.  Let me clarify that although I feel nobody has the ultimate authority to demonstrate conciousness, there are definitions by which we identify what we see.</p></td>

<br>
Is that true ? I though the whole point about the Turing Test is that it isnt concerned AT ALL if the machine is thinking. It is literally only concerned with external appearances - namely that if it sounds like its thinking then it must be thinking. I think you need to read the test and you'll see that this is the case.

But of course, we will probably come up with all kinds of other tests for Strong AI precisely because we all will wonder: Has this machine really achieved intelligence? Is it really conscious? Does it really feel? Does it have conscious, subjective experiences, like we have?
<br>
<br>
Eventually I think most of us will accept that it has really achieved true intelligence and awareness. Just like we've generally accepted that 'other people' are intelligent and conscious beings.

The AI Effect: "The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software. This is the AI effect. Many marketing people don't use the term 'artificial intelligence' even when their company's products rely on some AI techniques.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote">  The logic of runaway AI is valid, but we still need to consider the timing. Achieving human levels in a machine will not immediately cause a runaway phenomenon. Consider that a human level of intelligence has limitations. We have examples of this today'about six billion of them. Consider a scenario in which you took one hundred humans from, say, a shopping mall. This group would constitute examples of reasonably well educated humans. Yet if this group was presented with the task of improving human intelligence, it wouldn't get very far, even if provided with the templates of human intelligence. It would probably have a hard time creating a simple computer. Speeding up the thinking and expanding the memory capacities of these one hundred humans would not immediately solve this problem. </p></center>
<br>
depends how SAI is built.
<br>
<br>
If it's built to be a copy of human brain, then i agree it will not immediately runaway.
<br>
<br>
but suppose it's built from simple accalerating automata?
<br>
<br>
This is evolutionary comput8ng. genetic algorithms.
<br>
<br>
It self-modifies UP to human intelligence.
<br>
<br>
<br>
AND THEN CARRIES ON.
<br>
<br>
there's nothing fundamental about the limit of human intelligence.
<br>
<br>
It stopped evolving because it could master the environment, especially predation, without having to modify, and could keep repeating the blueprint for  100,000 years, though the body modified viz a viz germs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
but runaway machine intelligence is not like that.
<br>
<br>
Intelligence is a product of memory and speed..as you will see if you walk round a zoo.
<br>
<br>
We use it to solve the problems of survival through reproduction, and lately of ataempting personal indefinate survival.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here the species is getting more intelligent, partly by numbers, mainly by tooling up and techniques.
<br>
<br>
<br>
But evolutionary intelligence is 'adding on more skills' - nothing more.
<br>
<br>
I also dont see a limit to intelligence as it should be able to solve any possible problem capable of solution.
<br>
<br>
But I do see a danger of runaway, and I doubt we will have anytime from launching a pathogen like software that germinates intelligence to when it has soared past a Singularity and metabolised the universe.

Well clearly that is not the case. Speech (it is only a speech test) is the most automatable human characteristic there is. The fact is if a human took the test, the EXISTENCE of their intelligence (and mental states) would depend upon a third party's subjective assumptions about how bright they were. For instance, some mentally handicapped people would fail the Turing test, but they still have mental states, concsciousness and intelligence.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Why do you presume that machines won't have mental states?
<br>
<br>
If you are a materialist and think that the universe is made up out of matter, than there is really not much difference between a human being and a machine! Everything, including the human brain, is made up out of atoms or some even smaller building blocks of matter. So from a materialist's point of view, human beings and machines are indeed 'made of the same stuff'.
<br>
<br>
If you are a 'spiritualist' and think that everything is an expression or modification of consciousness itself, than the same logic says that there is really no fundamental difference between human beings and machines and that therefor there's no reason why machines couldn't become truly conscious and intelligent, like human beings.
<br>
<br>
The 3rd option is believing, like Descartes did, that there is a fundamental divide between matter and mind. But then, what is the mechanism by which the mind influences the body? This question has, as far as I know, never been answered in a philosophically satisfactory way. Also, there are so many indications now that mind originates from the brain.
<br>
<br>
For me, 'Cogito ergo sum' (I think, therefor I am) is not all that meaningful. There's no denying that machines can think. The question is whether machines can think consciously, can be conscious, that's the real question!
<br>
<br>
More meaningful than 'Cogito ergo sum' I think would be 'Cognito ergo sum': I am conscious, therefor I am.
<br>
<br>
The whole point of the effort towards Strong AI is that we somehow manage to transfer our intelligence and consciousness to machines, to a different platform from biology. A platform that is not as vulnerable and doesn't have all these biological limitations.
<br>
<br>
The question that needs to be answered is how we would know if we have succeeded! The Turing Test is one ingenious way to test an AI.
<br>
<br>
But maybe the AI itself will come up with an even more convincing test!

<br>
No they aren't. A brain is made up of neurons of vastly differing chemical composition to a digital computer. We know that brains cause mental states : it does not follow that computers do.
<br>
<br>
The defining feature of a computer is its manipulation of symbols from the point of view of an external observer. That is why the chemical composition of a computer is irrelevant. 
<br>
<br>
The defining feature of a brain is that its chemical composition is responsible for a phenomenological, not logical, process, known as thinking.
<br>
<br>
The brain can be thought of as a machine, but a machine who's defining characteristic is the manipulation of symbols from the point of view of an external oberver cannot be thought of as a brain.
<br>
<br>
In other words, with some irony its the Strong AI enthusiasts that believe in a kind of dualism. They believe that mere symbols can create phenomenological events. Its a bit like saying that a computer simulation of rainfall is the same thing as rainfall itself. Clearly this is just not true.
<br>
<br>
The Turing test is the apotheosis of this belief. In reality it has probably been passed in many ways today. But as you have realised, it sheds no light onto the consciosness problem.
<br>
<br>
Thinking is not logical or symbolic. It is physical and phenomenological. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, to allow us to believe that we can 'transfer' our thoughts to another medium down some kind of telephone line.

<br>
The issue here I think is the experience of the rainfall, rather than rainfall itself.
<br>
<br>
When we 'experience' rainfall, we don't experience rainfall but a representation, a virtual reality created by our brains.
<br>
<br>
I think computers will be very capable at creating similar 'inner' representations of reality based on sensory inputs. The question that still remains is whether they will have the actual inner experiences of that reality.
<br>
<br>
'Thinking is not logical or symbolic. It is physical and phenomenological.'
<br>
<br>
I agree, but silicon is just as physical and phenomenological as brain cells are.
<br>
<br>
Electricity running through complex arrangements of silicon is no less physical and phenomenological than an alive human brain.
<br>
<br>
To my mind it is the arrangement of the brain cells and the level of complexity of all of the processes that happen in a brain, that create human consciousness and intelligence, rather than the physical composition of a bunch of brain cells.
<br>
<br>
You seem to imply that it in the end it is the physical composition of brain cells that allows for consciousness, but for me that's not a convincing argument against the possibility of consciousness in a machine.

<br>
<br>
No it isn't. Although if you really want to confuse it, the 'experience of rainfall' in somebody's brain is is a phenomena as natural and physical as any rainfall.
<br>
<br>
"I agree, but silicon is just as physical and phenomenological as brain cells are."
<br>
<br>
But silicon does not have causal powers to create mental states. 
<br>
<br>
And nor is there a necessary relation between silicon and computing : a computer can be made of old tins and bits of string. We can create a computer from watching sunspots if we like. Is the sun thinking ? 
<br>
<br>
"Electricity running through complex arrangements of silicon is no less physical and phenomenological than an alive human brain. "
<br>
<br>
But electricity and silicon are utterly irrelevant to a computer. A computer is a logical construct. Without an observer to understand how the physical tokens (i.e voltage levels on a bit of silicon) relate to symbols such as o's and 1's, there is no computer.
<br>
A computer is a LOGICAL construct with no inherent physicality whatsoever. A computer exists only in the eyes of the beholder, the user. 
<br>
<br>
The same cannot be said of brains as we know that brains cause minds. We know that all brains consist of similar chemical composition. 
<br>
Best of all we know that we don't need a rational observer sat in the brain to decide which bits of the brain represent 0s and which bits represent 1s. So we know that the brain is not a computer, although it is capable of computing.
<br>
<br>
"You seem to imply that it in the end it is the physical composition of brain cells that allows for consciousness, but for me that's not a convincing argument against the possibility of consciousness in a machine. "
<br>
<br>
But it's not me that has to do the convincing : it's you. We know that brains cause minds. The question is : do computers cause minds ?
<br>
<br>
The answer is no. And the reason for that is simple. :-
<br>
<br>
(i) Thinking is physical ;
<br>
(ii) Computers are logical and mathematical ;
<br>
(iii) Mathematical objects cannot create physical phenomena.
<br>
<br>
In other words, a computer simulation of rainfall cannot create rainfall.
<br>
Similarly, a computer simulation of somebody experiencing rainfall cannot create the exeperience of experiencing rainfall.
<br>
<br>
That is because the experience of experiencing rainfall is a phenomena as physical (although not material) as rainfall itself. Mental objects are physical objects.

<br>
With this reply you have revealed your basic error. The whole point is that the mind does not have a relationship to the brain in the same way that a program does to a computer. That is what most AI people think and as a matter of epistemology is is plainly unproven ,and to my mind plainly wrong.
<br>
<br>
Thinking is a physical act. Think of a thought as a blue ball made of a solid. You would never thinkl of a solid ball as a program, as a program is mathematical and has no physical existence.
<br>
<br>
THinking is physical without being material. Thought acts, epistemelogically spealking, have no relationship to mathematics, hence their absolute forms (the experience of the colour blue, for example). 
<br>
<br>
The objects of thought acts CAN have relationships to logical entities. But thoughts acts themselves are as cosmologically real and substantive as footballs.

And probably we share the same concern: we don't want to lose true consciousness to machines that merely pretend to be or seem to be conscious and intelligent.

And yes, I am more likely to believe that another human being is truly conscious than I would believe 'some machine' to be truly conscious.

Either I am not making myself clear, or you aren't listening , but you dont appear to be responding.

<br>
The basic tenet of AI is that the mind has a relationshiop to the brain in the same way that a program has to a computer. I am saying that this is wrong.
<br>
<br>
I am saying that thinking is a PHYSICAL thing, like the surface tension of a liquid : it arises as a collective property of water molecules, bus is nonetheless PHYSICAL by nature. It is not mathematical.
<br>
<br>
SO I am saying thatg the relationship of the mind to the brain is the same as the relationship between a body of water and surface tension. It is a causal, physical relationship. Not mathematical. You really don't seem to to thinking that the relationship between mind and brain could bve anything other than computer and program. It's so implicit in what you are thinking you don't even know you are doing it.</p></td>

So there are solid indications that intelligence can be introduced into machines. Therefor I don't think there is any area of human intelligence that, in time, we will not be able to reproduce in machines.

Now, whether machines can also truly achieve subjective consciousness is more difficult to say, but I think that consciousness is an epi-phenomenon of intelligence because the two are clearly related to each other.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I mean that your idea of the physical causality of consciousness is not much more than an idea. It is hardly even a theory! Not in as far as you've presented it, anyway.
<br>
<br>
People have tried to find a physical substance called consciousness for ages, but have failed miserably.
<br>
<br>
Now you are saying: consciousness is not material, but none the less physical, like the surface tension of water.
<br>
<br>
But I don't see what's so very special about brain cells that would create this consciousness. That's why your idea is rather arcane to me, because you present no theory other than your assertion that consciousness has a physical causality.
<br>
<br>
And you choose to ignore the progress of AI, which is remarkable and clearly heading into the direction of intelligent machines.
<br>
<br>
In a very real way a simple machine fitted with a camera is already conscious of its environment simply because it can respond to that environment. Therefor it seems that intelligence is the essence of what we call 'human consciousness'.
<br>
<br>
In other words, there may be no such thing as 'mind' other than the universe fundamentally being conscious in a simple or a more complex way. The human mind emerges from human understanding and intelligence. And there is no question that we're well under way to reproducing that in machines.
<br>
<br>
You try to show that machines cannot possibly be conscious by describing a very simple computer. But it is really the level of complexity that determines intelligence and therefor the possibility of human consciousness.
<br>
<br>
But I am interested to hear what physical property of the brain you think produces consciousness and how that works. If you're really onto something, it would be a Nobel-prize contribution!

Speak for yourself, zombie. I wake up every morning.I suspect you do too.
<br>
<br>
"Now you are saying: consciousness is not material, but none the less physical, like the surface tension of water. "
<br>
<br>
Correct. You got there.
<br>
<br>
"But I don't see what's so very special about brain cells that would create this consciousness. "
<br>
<br>
You don't ? Try shooting yourself in the head. See how conscious you feel afterwards.
<br>
I think you are falling into a common trap - "the emperor wears no clothes' trap of AI.
<br>
Don't get caught in this silly trap of pretending consciousness doesn't exist. Just accept it does. Subjective mental states are one of, if not the most, exciting objective facts in the universe. 
<br>
<br>
It can seem difficult to get your head round the fact of 'proving'that consciosuness exists.
<br>
<br>
But philosophically it's no problem. If I'm conscious ( and I KNOW I am) then unless I think I'm very special, and I believe other people exist, then I can believe that other people are conscious too.
<br>
<br>
All knowledge is based on belied, don't forget. You can't see that matter is made of atoms with your senses but it would be strange, given the evidence, if atomic theory was not true.
<br>
<br>
An atomic radius can be measured, but only if we assume that atomic theory is actually correct. To measure something in science, you need a theory. We just don't have a full theory yet, and so 'measurement' is a problem.
<br>
<br>
Although in practice, anaesthetists measure consciosness already, in a rather blunt way. But measure it they do.
<br>
<br>
"why your idea is rather arcane to me, because you present no theory other than your assertion that consciousness has a physical causality. "
<br>
Stop listening to silly AI theorists and start listening to common sense.
<br>
There is NOTHING ARCANE about physics. That's just a silly thing to say isn't it.
<br>
<br>
If my theory is that mental phenomena are caused by physical forces, that's all I have to say !
<br>
<br>
There is no neuroscience to show exactly how. My belief is caused by a KNOWLEDGE of the EXACT way that computers work.
<br>
<br>
Saying that I don't know exactly how the brain works (nobody does) is not the same thing as admitting the computer is a brain.
<br>
<br>
On the contrary, unlike brains, computers are understood 100%. And computers are mathematical systems incapable of creating physical phenomena and semantic thought characteristics such as the experience of colours such as blue.
<br>
<br>
In short, as I've said before, if you believe that computers think then it's up to YOU to justify it. And that starts by accounting for how a syntactical system generates semantic.
<br>
<br>
And you know what ? You won't do it. I wrote to Marvin Minsky a few times. We had a nice chat until I asked him that question and funnily enough - the emails stopped !
<br>
<br>
"But it is really the level of complexity that determines intelligence and therefor the possibility of human consciousness. "
<br>
Another common AI misconception. If you cant show what 'complexity' is, or demonstrate how a 'more complicated' program can iteratively increase its causal physical powers, then the argument is a total red herring.
<br>
<br>
Complexity is not causal. In any case no program is anything other, I repeat, than a changing series of 0's and 1's in memory. It's difficult to arge that any program is more complicated than another EXCEPT from the programmer's perspective, which is irrelevant.
<br>
<br>
"But I am interested to hear what physical property of the brain you think produces consciousness and how that works. If you're really onto something, it would be a Nobel-prize contribution! "
<br>
The physical property of the brain that causes consciousness is most likely the property that causes consciousness. Dont forget the universe is not a system : its a semantic block that does what it does. Physics is a system. If physics can't handle consciousness (and I dont see that it can't to be frank) then physics has to change to accomodate it.
<br>
<br>
Or , like computer scientists, they can still insist the emperor wears no clothes.

<br>
We thank our existence to complexity as much as to physics. Sure, we are carbon-based life, but carbon itself is not alive, intelligent or conscious like human beings are.
<br>
<br>
If carbon itself is not inherently conscious, or even alive, then how can a human suddenly become alive, intelligent and conscious?
<br>
<br>
Complexity seems to be the clear answer, rather than some unexplained and unknown physical property of carbon or matter in a more general sense.
<br>
<br>
If it is really complexity that accounts for our human life, intelligence and consciousness, then a similar level of complexity in a machine may cause it to be alive, intelligent and conscious as well. 
<br>
<br>
If complexity is the key ingredient for intelligence and consciousness, then it is irrelevant that a computer is in essence a logical system. Because consciousness probably is not a consequence of physics per se but a consequence of complexity.
<br>
<br>
In this way computers could really become subjectively conscious, think and have a mind, like human beings.
<br>
<br>
This is not the same as saying that consciousness does not exist or isn't a real phenomenon, quite the contrary, but it emerges as a consequence of complexity rather than physics.
<br>
<br>
Anaesthetists can only measure so-called neural correlates of consciousness, but not consciousness itself. They are simply measuring processes in the brain.
<br>
<br>
It is just your presumption that they must be measuring consciousness because you first of all presume that consciousness is a physical property of matter.
<br>
<br>
AI research is showing that intelligence is a function of complexity and that it has nothing to do with some unknown property of matter. If machines achieve much higher levels of intelligence and as a consequence show all the signs of being self-aware, we can not insist that they are not conscious.
<br>
<br>
Unless maybe some new physical theory can prove that consciousness really is a property of physics. But to date there is no theory of physics that accounts for consciousness.

It's certainly no proof it's a mathematical or computing property either, but consciousnes is highly inconsistent with computation.
<br>
<br>
"We thank our existence to complexity as much as to physics."
<br>
<br>
the last time i looked "complexity" was neither a) a causal force b) a property of anything or c) defined. You define it : you quantify it : stop talking vaguely. The onus is on YOU.
<br>
<br>
"Sure, we are carbon-based life, but carbon itself is not alive, intelligent or conscious like human beings are. "
<br>
<br>
I have gone over this point before. A water molecule is not "wet" but a large number of them have the property of "wetness". The physical world is full of aggregate properties such as solidity, liquidity etc.
<br>
<br>
"Complexity seems to be the clear answer,"
<br>
<br>
Clear ? What on earth is clear about what you are saying ? Handwavey references to 'complexity' ? A carbon atom is very complicated. If you don't believe me study quantum and particle physics for a while. So according to you, a carbon atom IS conscious as it's so 'complex'.
<br>
<br>
"If it is really complexity that accounts for our human life, intelligence and consciousness, then a similar level of complexity in a machine may cause it to be alive, intelligent and conscious as well. "

Come on. This is drivel.

How ? explain an iterative mechanism. Say we have a relatively simple logical system X. It is beneath conciousness. We know how computers work : we know everythig about them. So you should be able to tell me what the next step is to turn X into a conscious system, Y. Give me an idea.
<br>
<br>
"Anaesthetists can only measure so-called neural correlates of consciousness, but not consciousness itself. "
<br>
<br>
Physicists generally only measure 'correlates' of anything they ever observe. An atomic radius is not measured with a ruler. It is measured with highly derived system of wave mechanics based upon the assumption that atomic theory is correct. Most non-sense data measurement is 'correlated' and rarely is anything ever measured 'directly'. That is science.
<br>
<br>
"AI research is showing that intelligence is a function of complexity "
<br>
<br>
What has intelligence got to do with consciousness ? Explain the link.
<br>
<br>
"But to date there is no theory of physics that accounts for consciousness. "
<br>
<br>
But physics is compatible with consciosness nonetheless. Computation is 100% incompatible with phenomenological, semantic mental events. I asked you before to show how semantic arises from syntax. Make that your next challenge.

<br>
<br>
An experiment has been done to test for self-awareness in dolphins. Dolphins seem to understand that they see themselves in a mirror, rather than another dolphin.
<br>
<br>
Similar tests have of course been done with babies and primates.
<br>
<br>
These experiments are interesting because when we talk about human intelligence, self-awareness is one of the key aspects. It seems that when intelligence evolves, self-awareness emerges.
<br>
<br>
When this kind of self-awareness emerges in machines, in theory this could be a kind of 'blindsight'.
<br>
<br>
In other words, even when a machine exibits intelligent interaction with its environment as well as self-awareness and 'common sense', it might still not have subjective awareness.
<br>
<br>
I guess it depends on the theory of consciousness you adhere to, because subjectivity can by definition not be objectively proven.
<br>
<br>
Maybe an AI will one day come up with a conclusive theory of consciousness and therefor conclude that it is not and has never been conscious.

You have to distinguish between being self-aware and being conscious, which you're not.It's been a persistent strand of thought in anthroplogy that self-wareness in humans developed only recently : whereas consciousness in mammals has been around for millions of years. 
<br>
<br>
Given that, I doubt that many mice would do well in an IQ test.But they're conscious, I have no doubt, but highly unlikely to be self-aware.

<br>
<br>
You are still missing the point! I know that many creatures are conscious, yet lack a sense of self-awareness.
<br>
<br>
I am trying to make you consider the opposite: do you know creatures that have self-awareness but are not conscious at all?
<br>
<br>
Can you imagine an entity that's self-aware, understands itself, understands its place in the world, but is at the same time completely unconscious? That was my question.
<br>
<br>
Because make no mistake about it: machines will be self-aware as a consequence of their intelligence.
<br>
<br>
When this self-awareness in machines will have happened, will it be possible to maintain that they are still completely unconscious?
<br>
<br>
As I said before: if so, this would be an extreme case of blindsight. Most people will feel that these AIs will indeed have become truly conscious.
<br>
<br>
This would mean that AIs of today are probably about as conscious as ants - not completely unconscious but not yet very conscious either.
<br>
<br>
But that very simple consciousness will evolve into human-level consciousness within a few decades.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"...The whole point is that the mind does not have a relationship to the brain in the same way that a program does to a computer."
<br>
<br>
You are absolutely correct!
<br>
<br>
However, your selectively singling out software instructions as the basis for the implausibility of a "computerized" brain is an unfortunate oversight. If that were all to consider in a fair argument then I would agree with you. But it's not all to consider, so ...
<br>
<br>
You seem to have stopped short in your thinking process about thinking processes. A software program can be likened to a desire. Is your mind composed of and manifest by desires alone? That is basically what you are trying to state for the case of a would-be computer mind. C'mon now, let's play fair.
<br>
<br>
Consider that there is not only the program instructions. In the case of an AI, the program instructions would simply be the "virtual engine" that "virtually reshapes" the computer hardware that runs it. Well, this virtual engine does nothing on it's own. Just as in the real world, computer programs don't just sit and spin. They work on data of some sort (memory). The computer also has various inputs that feed into the process. There are also outputs that feed back into the system as well as outside of the system.
<br>
<br>
"Thinking is a physical act. Think of a thought as a blue ball made of a solid. You would never thinkl of a solid ball as a program, as a program is mathematical and has no physical existence."
<br>
<br>
Ah, but a whole computer system running the program? You see, a computer program is nothing without hardware to execute it much as your memories are useless if not stored in your neurons and acted upon by your fuller mind which is manifest by your collective brain neurons (hardware), other experiences, hopes, and dreams (software and memory stored in the connections of neurons).
<br>
<br>
The whole process manifests something emergent beyond the parts: It is not just software instructions, nor processor, nor hardware memory, nor data, nor input, nor output; it is a working whole. Take away one piece and you lose the whole.
<br>
<br>
All of these things together are more of what a "computerized mind" should be likened to if you were presenting your argument fairly. Singling out software instructions as the sole basis for a computerized mind is easy to debunk. Quite a bit more difficult when all the true components are taken as a whole.
<br>
<br>
Certainly today's level and form of computing is not what it needs to be to pass a Turing Test. And I agree that a Turing Test tells us nothing certain and only allows us to assume this or that regarding the AI's ability to relate as a human. But, just as a complete operating "computer system" is more than the sum of its parts, pry open your skull, grab a chunk, toss it in the air and see if you remain "you". If not that, try bashing yourself several times in the head to induce amnesia and see if you can make sense of your current living trajectory. 
<br>
<br>
"THinking is physical without being material. Thought acts, epistemelogically spealking, have no relationship to mathematics, hence their absolute forms (the experience of the colour blue, for example)."
<br>
<br>
You, personally, are born pre-wired to experience blue in a certain way. Your experiences may modify that somewhat, if for instance, someone hits you square in the face with a blue baseball bat. You are confusing genetics with thinking. A child that is not colorblind can't call something red or blue but they certainly know and experience the distintion. However, a child doesn't know or experience the blue sky except through experience. Similarly, an AI can be built to have defacto (hardwired) experiences of many things and only come to "know" others through data or experience.
<br>
<br>
"The objects of thought acts CAN have relationships to logical entities. But thoughts acts themselves are as cosmologically real and substantive as footballs."
<br>
<br>
Ummmm, so are computer outputs that cause other computer actions, i.e. updating memory with new data, outputing stuff to the screen, causing a speaker to vibrate to produce a waveform of what we might call a "beep". All of these things are as cosmologically real and substantive as footballs, wouldn't you agree?
<br>
<br>
In summary "You" is manifest from your physical brain no less than a computerized mind would be manifest from its physical brain. Look beyond thinking of an AI built from a Radio Shack TRS-80. Look beyond thinking of an AI built from technology that is 100 times faster than what you are working on today. Look beyond thinking of an AI built with von Neuman architecture. Look beyond. Just look beyond. You are trapping and stifling your own creativity and reasoning otherwise.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Alright. Let me explain in simple sentences.
<br>
<br>
A computer is a logical, mathematical construct. Computational theory does not emanate from the physical sciences : it emanates from the mathemtical sciences. 
<br>
<br>
A computer can be made of anything : old tins and bits of string , or from water running through valve systems.The only thing necessary is to map a physical token (i,e a voltage, or the strength of water flow in a valve system, ir indeed absolutely anything) to a symbol such as a 0 or 1. That is all computers need.
<br>
<br>
We could take a program of a human mind (a memory map of 0's and 1's and map it to, for instance, the quantum states of atoms in a wall to every sequence of that program. 
<br>
<br>
Thus the wall in my bedroom is now 'running a program of the human mind'. Why ? Because I have decided to map the program to the wall.
<br>
<br>
I can look at a cup and decide that the cup represents '1'. The cup is 'running a program'. Not a very interesting one admittedly, as it just says '1'.
<br>
<br>
In other words, it's me, as the observer, who decides what the program is. The answer to your example is that of course the machines are running a program when people go out the room. They are running one imposed on the physical structure of that machine by the machine's designers. 
<br>
<br>
They are also running an infinity of other programs at the same time. I could decide that the voltage levels that currently map to 0's and 1's be inverted. Now the machine is running a program of my choice, not the designers. 
<br>
<br>
Are you getting the picture ? It's up to me what the program is as I decide how to map the symbol to the physical characteristic. 
<br>
<br>
Imagine a martian came to earth and saw your computer and imagine the human race was wiped out. There would be no knowledge that the a voltage of -.1 V mapped to a '1' and voltage of +.1V mapped to a '0'. 
<br>
<br>
From their epistemic perpective then no, the computer would not be running a program, or at least not the one your designers had constructed. That is because hey lack your mapping rules.
<br>
<br>
In other words, the computer as a physical machine remains the same and does the same things, but without an observer WITH MAPPING RULES there is no program.
<br>

<br>
<br>
The requirement for the "two brains" requirement is, frankly, the most ridiculous consequence of AI beliefs, although some do argue it.
<br>
<br>
It is, of course, a nonsense. It means that in your brain you have to have an additional 'person'(or sub-person) in your head who understands the brain's mappings.
<br>
<br>
The main reason that we can conclude that mental events are not computational is that they have a form which is absolute. The experience of blue is absolute , not quantitative. It dosn't feel like ' a bit of red', for instance, or 'similar to sexual arousal' or 'has facets of the feeling of depression'. It feels like it feels and it feels like nothing else. That is incompatible with computation, which is syntactical and mathematical. 
<br>
<br>
It is the same as the difference between a piece of solid matter and the number 1 : semantic and syntax.
<br>
<br>
The requirement to have a second brain in the head gets us nowhere, of course.
<br>
<br>
We simply ask "what is this sub-person who understands the brain's mappings?". If it is a computer program then we are back to square one, namely we have a computer program ( the sub person ) that refers to the rest of the brain as a gigantic digital memory. And who understands how the "sub-person" is mapped ? Who 'runs' the sub-person ?
<br>
<br>
May be we need three brains then, an additional brain to understand how the second person's mappings are set up. Or maybe not.</p></td>

I didn't know humans (e.g. you) can talk convincingly about what's absolute and what's not. From our perspective, everything is relative.

"The experience of blue is absolute , not quantitative. It dosn't feel like ' a bit of red', for instance, or 'similar to sexual arousal' or 'has facets of the feeling of depression'."

1. Is a human psyche a system of non-random transformations and/or movements of matter and/or energy in a human brain?

What is blue relative to ?
<br>
<br>
"Au contraire, people _do_ describe partial and hybrid experiences. Ever heard of "bitter-sweet"? Or "mixed feelings"? "
<br>
<br>
I repeat then, what is blue relative to ?
<br>
<br>
People don't describe hybrid experiences, they describe the simultaneous experience of different feelings. As they say in chemistry, a mixture is not a compound, it is a mixture.
<br>
<br>
"1. Is a human psyche a system of non-random transformations and/or movements of matter and/or energy in a human brain? "
<br>
<br>
What is a 'psyche' - do you mean a 'mind'?
<br>
<br>
The answer is the mind is (probably - we don't know what brains do of course, unlike computers) the physical and mental phenomena associated like an aggregate property of a group of brain cells. What the significance of 'randomness' in your scheme is I don't know.
<br>
<br>
There are other examples of physical phenomena that are aggregated - for instance, the surface tension of a liquid. We don't speak of a water molecule as being 'wet', but we think of a body of water as being 'wet'.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, no one neurone is 'conscious', but a group of them can be.
<br>
<br>
But this is all speculation. The neuroscience isn't there yet. Computers on the other hand are not the subject of behavioural speculation at all.
<br>
<br>
"2. Is a computer program a system of non-random transformations and/or movements of matter and/or energy in a (silicon) processor?"
<br>
<br>
No. A computer program is a time based development of a series of 0's and 1'.s
<br>
<br>
I like the Markov definition of a computer :-
<br>
<br>
"a string rewriting system that uses grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols. "
<br>
<br>
see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614001739/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation  </a>

I think your obsession with silicon indicates you need to read up on what a computer actually is, my confused chum.

<br>
The observer's eyesight quality - some people don't distinguish tones, others don't even distinguish different fundamental colours. Probably no two people experience blue in exactly the same way. When they talk about "blue", they can only be said to _approximately_ understand eachother.
<br>
<br>
"People don't describe hybrid experiences, they describe the simultaneous experience of different feelings."
<br>
Your proof of this being...?
<br>
<br>
"What is a 'psyche' - do you mean a 'mind'?"
<br>
Yes, I think I meant approximately ;) the same thing you mean when you say "mind".
<br>
<br>
"The answer is the mind is... the physical and mental phenomena" etc.
<br>
1. This definition is circular: you're using "mental" to define "mind".
<br>
2. This can't be the answer to my "yes"/"no" question. I'm still waiting.
<br>
<br>
"What the significance of 'randomness' in your scheme is I don't know."
<br>
3. A system of transformations like in the above definitions is "non-random" if the majority of its elementary tranformations have non-uniform probability distributions for their possible outcomes. (Think of a mechanism of multiple flipping coins - if, say, 60% of those coins are loaded and have heads/tails probabilities other than 50/50, you have a non-random system of transformations.) Complete this with the property that all transformations in the system are connected (so it's not just a collection of independent coins) and re-read my first question.
<br>
<br>
"No. A computer program is a time based development of a series of 0's and 1'.s"
<br>
Fair enough. Second question rephrased:
<br>
2. Is [the physical process implementing what humans call "a computer program"] a system of non-random interconnected transformations and/or movements of matter and/or energy in a (silicon) processor?
<br>
<br>
"I think your obsession with silicon indicates you need" etc.
<br>
No obsession involved. I'm trying to keep things clear, to have a grip on what we're talking about. I may be using a particular example of computing hardware, but I'm still talking about computing in general terms, so my statements should remain as true for silicon transistor arrays as they are for any other hardware.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
So what if some people can't distinguish 'tones' ! It's the quality that matters. The quality of blue. 
<br>
What makes you think that human beings, made of ostensibly the same stuff and connected by DNA to an extremely high precentage (it is the same species) WOULDN'T experience blue in the same way ?
<br>
<br>
The point about colour blindness supports ME, not you. It is a recognised defect specifically because such people cannot identify two separate colours, two qualities, that most people can identify.
<br>
<br>
Nice try, but you dodged the question. Frankly, there is no answer so it's no suprise.
<br>
<br>
"Your proof of this being...? "
<br>
<br>
Being a human being and having had 'mixed feelings' myself.
<br>
<br>
"1. This definition is circular: you're using "mental" to define "mind"." 
<br>
Ok. Eradicate 'mental' from the definition and just leave "physical and non-material"
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"2. This can't be the answer to my "yes"/"no" question. I'm still waiting" 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What I wrote was in response to question 2 was :-
<br>
<br>
'No. A computer program is a time based development of a series of 0's and 1'.s '
<br>
<br>
You may have noticed the first word was 'No'. A computer would not have scanned that in so incorrectly - your brain is evidently proof of my point.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"my statements should remain as true for silicon transistor arrays as they are for any other hardware."
<br>
<br>
and so is my answer which you are studiously ignoring. A computer program is a series of sequentially changing 0's and 1's. It is a mathematical and logical entity, hence the term 'software'.

This isn't going anywhere, so I'll drop it. I need answers to my two questions if I'm to understand you.
<br>
<br>
"What I wrote (was) in response to question 2 was :" etc.
<br>
I noticed your "no" to question 2, but I was referring to question 1 when I said you didn't give a direct answer. I seem to have mislead you by putting a "2." before that answer - it wasn't in any way related to what the number meant in my previous post.
<br>
Fact: you didn't say "yes" or "no" to question 1.
<br>
In the meantime I've slightly changed it due to your comments. Here is the last version I'm on standby for:
<br>
"1. 1. Is a human mind a system of non-random interconnected transformations and/or movements of matter and/or energy in a human brain?"
<br>
<br>
Now, as for question 2, I noticed you answered it and decided to rephrase it (but somehow you chose to completely ignore this half of my post) to find out what really interests me. You can think of it as a third question, derived from the former #2, if you will. (I won't repeat it, it's already up there.) This one too admits only "yes" or "no" (or let's say "I don't know" would be a third option).</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Nice try to change the question by adding "physical manifestation" ! Not that it makes any difference at all.
<br>
<br>
A computer program is a mathematical entity. It has no "manifestation". A physical/biolgical/phenomenal event has a 'manifestation' , such as a manifestation of a smallpox disease by the presence of its symptoms.
<br>
<br>
The physical tokens in computers are the source from which the computer program is interpreted by the observer. That program itself can be reinterpreted for display purposes by , for instance, a graphics card and a VDU.
<br>
<br>
The screen output, if there is any, would be the closest thing you could describe as a 'manifestation' of a program.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"2'.2 the transformations/movements are actually random? "
<br>
<br>
No
<br>
<br>
"2'.3 the transformations/movements aren't interconnected? "
<br>
<br>
Yes they are. The movements themselves are related to the program that operates them and dictates their movements.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"2'.4 it doesn't take place in a "processor"?"
<br>
<br>
A computer program is used to map the physical states of the hardware it runs on.
<br>
<br>
One is called 'software' ; the other 'hardware'.

What is this? "Let's NOT read his posts and give him dumb answers to piss him off"? I've already told you in two consecutive posts that I'd changed question 2 (that's why I tagged it 2' this time - there's an apostrophe there, can you see it?) to this:

<br>
"Is [the physical process implementing what humans call 'a computer program'] a system of non-random interconnected transformations and/or movements of matter and/or energy in a (silicon) processor?"

Can you see the words "physical process implementing" there? Could you please remember them if we continue this discussion? (Jeez, will I have to tell you everything twice?)
<br>
<br>
"A computer program is a mathematical entity. It has no 'manifestation'."
<br>
Firstly, you're wasting my time and not giving me "yes" or "no" again (for 2'.1).
<br>
Secondly, what the #@&amp;$ do you call the link between software and hardware if not "manifestation"?

2'.4: I still don't get you. WHERE is the program and HOW can it control hardware from there?</p></td>

<br>
Firstly it is perfectly possible to have questions that are not suited to yes or no answers. 'Yes' or 'No' imply that the question has an unambiguos status given the surrounding context. Not replying 'Yes' or 'No' is simply a way of clarifying context. Ask a lawyer. Ask me, I'm one.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, demanding the terms in which a question can be answered is a particularly unsubtle rhetorical trick which I refuse to accommodate unless permitted to establish context first. 
<br>
<br>
Thirdly, despite the fact that I am unwlling to put up with a determination of terms, I consider my answers to your questions unambiguous in the extreme. I dont think a computer program is physical in any way, and your rather unsibtle efforts to prove that they do will amount to nothing. In any case, establishing what a computer is, or amounts no, has nothing whatsoever to do with establishing what brains do, another pointless linkage on your part.
<br>
<br>
Epistemelogically brains and computers are in completely different classes : chalk and cheese. A computer is DEFINED by function. Therefore its modus operandi is 100% utterly unambiguous.A brain is a naturally occuring physiological organ whose 'functions' (inasmuch as that word is appropriate) can only be discerned by scientific enquiry. The way it works CAN ONLY BE ASCERTAINED BY SCIENTIFIC ENQUIRY. It cannot be done by simply assuming it to be a computer. That is patently silly and ridiculously presumptive.

I didn't quite know which post to reply to as I followed all of the discussions with Timothy and donjoe.
<br>
<br>
Your arguments are well taken. If I'm following you correctly you feel, as I do, that there's just something particularly interesting about the human brain that causes human consciousness to emerge. Further, I imagine that you'd agree that a single functioning neuron does not bring about this awareness and consciousness. If I am mistaken, please correct me.
<br>
<br>
As I understand your points, a computer making ones and zeros can not bring about consciousness. I'm not really sure about what the future holds when current processing models are computing in the terahertz, petahertz, exahertz, or zettahertz ( 10^-21 vs 10^-9 for gigahertz) when things go primarily optical, but for now I'd have to say that I agree with you. Current von Neuman computer systems working at their current speeds and architectures most likely have no (or very little) capacity for consciousness.
<br>
<br>
However, I'm curious about all of this synthetic intelligence and consciousness talk and I would appreciate your assistance in tearing down the most popular scenario of how its proponents say it will occur.
<br>
<br>
They (proponents of a conscious, super AI) speak of alternate forms of computing rather than the von Neuman type as the Holy Grail. 
<br>
<br>
I imagine that in the advancement of computing technology, alternate forms of computing architecture is what research of natural systems is leading to. Given the frantic pace of discovery and advances in the fields of optical and quantum computing, nanotech, and micro-biomechanical and chemical systems it would be foolish to think that von Neuman computing will remain the standard for centuries or decades to come, wouldn't you agree? 
<br>
<br>
I think we would all like to one day be operating our own personal palm-sized mega systems that outperform our current systems by a hundred thousand fold one day, I'm sure. The new multi-cores are great, but I personally don't think they'll get us there... but these new emerging technologies probably will.
<br>
<br>
The advent of current day synthetic retinas and other sensory nerve replacements are evidence to a technological trend that presages that ?someday? in the future replication of the function and structure of a single neuron with advanced nano, chemical, optical, quantum, and MEMS technology will be a reality. Further this replicate model could, by way of its design, emulate structurally, chemically, and electrically any particular neuron in a brain; axon, dedrites, nucleus, synapse, neural response patterns, etc. Essentially creating a versatile synthetic replica of any biological neuron. This includes all electro-chemical processes, including DNA. If you doubt this please share your reasoning.
<br>
<br>
Now, if this neuron were made to be completely compatible with your human biology, and I could replace just one of your neurons with its synthetic equivalent (structure, neural response pattern, etc.) such that it handled all of the inputs and outputs as would the true original and neighboring neurons behaved and communicated as normal, do you think you would lose yourself, become someone else, lose consciousness, or die? If so, please explain with scientific reasoning.
<br>
<br>
If I were to replace a second, a third, a fourth...? You have another 50 billion or so to go (depending of course on one's usual rate of alcohol consumption).
<br>
<br>
At what point would you estimate that your consciousness would break down or turn into something else? 100, 1000, 10,000, 1 million, 1 billion, 50 billion? If you believe that a breakdown in consciousness would occur at some point when your natural biological neurons are being replace with their compatible functional equivalents please explain when and why in absolute scientific terms.
<br>
<br>
If you can not scientifically explain a breakdown then why can't I then, instead of inserting my duplicates into your neural structure just simply create a new, totally duplicate---brain---your brain? Is their something in the universe that will not allow this? Is there something that would not allow multiple "you"s? Consciousness is a locale issue. "You" would not be in two places at the same time. However, there would be two divergent "you"s (consciousnesses) that are thinking identically until unshared events cause them to get more and more out of sync. The last scenario, however, is not the point.
<br>
<br>
If consciousness is not a neuron or all of the neurons, connections, and physical activity then what is it?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's an emergent phenomenon and I think you sad the same in other terms. Emerging from what you might ask. Well, firstly, I'd like to posit that emergence is as fundamental a property of the universe as any other property you can name. Big Bang to Earthly Nature. 
<br>
<br>
We're talking emergent systems here. Imagine, if you were able to replace H2O with a synthetic equivalent that had all of H2O's properties, exactly, would Mother Nature lie down and call it a day, or would she continue her delicate equilibrium dance without skipping a beat?
<br>
<br>
All of the universe is emergent from quantum processes that build emergent multi-layered structure after emergent multi-layered structure. Replace the quantum processes with an equivalent and you still have the universe.
<br>
<br>
Consciousness, the mind, is emergent from the "processes" of the brain. Create a synthetic brain what do you think will happen? Nothing will emerge? If nothing, why? Are we too bio-human-centric to extrapolate otherwise?
<br>
<br>
A Turing Test will only allow us to ASSUME positively or negatively the consciousness of any entity synthetic or otherwise. That is the best we can do even with fellow humans WITH FULL FACULTIES: They act like me, walk like me, talk like me, speak like me, laugh like me, cry like me, and other ways respond like me... hmmm... they must think like me... they must be aware like me. We can relate. Super AI will go beyond human levels of awareness and we will no longer be able to relate on the same level, kinda like you to a worm. But because knowledge of what it is to be human is built in the SAI will be able to relate some things in its realm to us, but the far majority it will not. We will endeavor to encorporate it into ourselves, however. Problem solved.
<br>
<br>
It's nice being human. As far as we know right now, we and our fellow aware earth-bound creatures have brought intent and awareness to a universe that was once only possibility and probabilty. 
<br>
<br>
Actually, and this is perhaps a topic for a different forum, I believe that one day we'll discover that multi-layered emergence entails multi-layered intellect and awareness of DIFFERENT KINDS and on different time scales. I stress "different kinds" to avoid the tendency to think in human terms and interpret that statement to imply human forms of thinking and awareness. Think of the complex structures of the universe and it's interactions of gas, electromagnetism (light, infrared, radio, x-ray, gamma-ray, etc), chemisty, and gravity. Something is emergent there beyond the parts (and there's a heck of a lot more parts and interactions than in the human brain) that we can see and feel. Galaxies, black holes, etc., may all have their own forms of emergent awareness and intelligence on physical scales and time scales far unlike our own. Now, go figure out a Turing Test for that ;0)

<br>
There's no clarification unless you explicitly say "The question is wrong and can't be answered. This is why:". If you just don't give a direct answer without saying why, you only give the impression you're not interested in discussing the same issues or you're paying attention or you don't understand the question etc. You have to be explicit (a lawyer should know that).
<br>
<br>
"I dont think a computer program is physical in any way"
<br>
But still you agree there's a direct link between it and the hardware it runs on. And you haven't yet explained that link (like I asked you to - and this time it wasn't a "yes"/"no" question). And BTW, this: "A computer program is used to map the physical states of the hardware it runs on." is not a proper definition of a program, as it makes it seem like the program is just a description of already-structured hardware, whereas computer programs actually exist _before_ the hardware gets structured and they contain the structural information to be used in shaping the hardware. So as far as I'm concerned, your conception still doesn't adequately explain the SW-HW link. (Also, I'm curious to see what answer you give BigMT for his version of almost the same question - the Mind-Neuron link explanation.)
<br>
<br>
"It cannot be done by simply assuming it to be a computer. That is patently silly and ridiculously presumptive."
<br>
Your definition of "computer" seems to be ridiculously narrow. :)</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote"> Given that superintelligence will one day be technologically feasible... </p></center> This begs the definition of intelligence.  As I understand it, Turing Test looks at a system (from the outside) to see if that system behaves like a human.   The minimum practical test is to get a computer to respond to typed text inputs with text responses which appear human in the eyes of a human.
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614001739/http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~asaygin/tt/ttest.html#intro" target="_blank">http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~asaygin/tt/ttest.html#intr  o</a>
<br>
<br>
Self-awareness is internal to a system, not observable from the outside.  This is definitional.   The fact it cannot be measured doesn't mean it's not part of human intelligence, unless you specifically define human intelligence to exclude self awareness.
<br>
<br>
<br>
From an external perspective, superintelligence might work at the text level someday.  Even if superintelligence happens, the phenomenon of self awareness is  not going to be a part of it anytime soon.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just because a test cannot be devised for self awareness doesn't mean it's not a real thing.  Human awareness obviously is real.  If you ask me, it's pretty obvious my cats are self aware also.  I don't think we are any closer to understanding physics self awareness today than we were 100,000 years ago.
<br>
<br>
 if you cannot test for self awareness, you cannot say the intelligence is human, again, I'll remember to see where we stand with Turing machines for text in 2030 (25 years from now).  Ramping up that technology into a fully functional humanLike machine can be made  to work like an android, indistinguishasble from a real human unless you cut into it...or you replace the human brain with something electronic, so even the whole body functions as if it were a human inside, but the brain is not alive.... that system appears human in every way, thus meeting the Turing Test.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 create machines that behave like humans in their language or other prcessing,

Personally, I think a fly probably has a simple kind of self-awareness, but I don't know.  I feel just about certain my cats have some of what I experience as self-awareness, but I don't know.  I consider myself self-aware, but I cannot prove it to anyone who doubts it.
<br>
<br>
There is a reason I cannot prove my self-awareness to anyone else.  Self-awareness is observable only by the self, nothing/no one else.  I am aware of my being and you are not.  All you can know of me is my behavior from an external perspective.  You cannot replace your awareness with mine, just like I cannot mine with yours.  We can communicate as one being to another.  The phenomenon of self awareness is outside the scope of the energy/mass system described by string theory, quantum mechanics, general relativity, Maxwell's equations, laws of motion, or any other system of math.

The cultists must have seen this 'paradox' before.  Surely, somewhere in the mountain of material gurged forth by Mr. Kurzweil, there must be a proof that I am sentient, or not, whichever I am.  I know whether I am sentient or not, and whether I am a computer or not, but do they?  
<br>
<br>
This must be the reality-paradox.  That would explain it.  You take reality, make it something else, then it's not real, even though it is reality.  People who cannot see this might be aware, but at a lower level, because it is so obvious how this explains everything, if you think about it.  It is the one scientific truth that cannot be proven by experiment. :-)</p></td>

<br>
<br>
If you want to argue about whether my cats have awareness pretty much the same way people do, I am all ears (eyes I guess).  My opinion:  not only are cats self-aware, they are people, just the way African Homo Sapiens were people, even when they were not considered as such.
<br>
<br>
I think rocks are self aware, at a really faint level.
<br>
<br>
I think self awareness is outside the scope of energy and mass studied by mainstream physicists.  Mainstream physicists are those focused on string theory, particle physics, relativtiy, and anything else that is provable by experiment.
<br>
<br>
Some reality has a nature that makes it unreproducable by experiment.  Self awareness arises from that domain.

This is also false.   Some things exist only as systems.  If you disassemble an automobile, you don't have a car anymore.  This is the basis of Systems analysis, as distinct from 'reductionist' analysis.  I tend to assume you are acquainted with these disctinctions, but to say awareness has to be made of smaller parts is a wild assumption.  I think awareness might be made of nothing but itself, with no component elements.  It's an element unto itself.

My definition of awareness is the sense of self I experience and which can be experienced by no one other than me.  I deny it has any components.  Since only I can observe it, you cannot deduce anything about it.  You cannot tell whether any of my testimony about my  awareness is true or false, except the fact that you can't observe my awareness.

<br>
<br>
a) I believe you're both poor attempts to pass a Turing Test, so don't take this as a personal attack but rather, an attempt to describe your affect as artificial constructs.
<br>
<br>
b) Things we are not aware of don't exist, for that is how the awareness/reality interface works, with or withut paradox.
<br>
<br>
c) One artificial construct's assertion that awareness is (in so many words) 'that which touches but we cannot (yet) touch', is another man's phlogiston.
<br>
<br>
d) Another artificial construct's assertion that awareness is physical while the mathematical logic of a computer is metaphysical, places one's awareness in the curious position of noting that this thing that can't be awareness because it isn't physical (a computer program), only exists within human awareness which, I heard one artificial construct say, is physical.
<br>
<br>
That you may be able to connect the logical dots of these statements may suggest that you are truly intelligent and aware, but the fact that you may not be able to do so doesn't mean that you're not intelligent and aware.
<br>
<br>
There's no denying, though, that you're both rude and not in the Don Rickles manner which makes one laugh, but in the manner of a Turing-bot that hasn't yet learned how to...
<br>
<br>
For Christopher and extrasense, a perspective on the Turing test ideal:
<br>
<br>
Fooling humans is easy. Relatively speaking, that is. Fooling an  AI to believe it's  sentient is another matter. The Turing Test gives way to the Descartes Dilemma, which is passed by being unable to decide one way or another while remaining firmly convinced that one IS (sentient).
<br>
<br>
Not that we will be likely to tell.
<br>
<br>
One hand clapping and all that and how ironic that one has to be aware to doubt that one is aware?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hello --
<br>
<br>
I would like some of this action. So, if I agree with you that a computer is nothing but a mathematical and logical construct - then tell me: why can not such a construct be a mind ?  It seems that your explanation is that it takes an observer to make sense. Fine, but what if such is also true of us ?  And who would this "Uber Observer" be ?  God ? Hmmm...
<br>
<br>
Heinrich Hertz believed that even static, yet very complex mathematical equations possessed conciousness. Since this low tech forum does not allow me to see the thread as I write, I must paraphrase. But the one fellow did point out what I believe is the key, not just to mind - but to life as well. Complexity. Once a pattern of symbols becomes sufficiently complex, and especially when it becomes a pattern that adapts and changes itself - it begins more and more to exhibit the qualities of mind and life.
<br>
<br>
And in the end, no matter what you all argue - the outward signs of conciousness and life are all we have to go on to settle this argument.
<br>
<br>
Let us say for instance that we run across (as has been explored ad nuseum on sci-fi shows) a coherent and evolving complex organized energy form that outwardly exhibits the qualities of sentient life ?  Now, these energy forms may appear to have no mechanism or explanation for HOW they are concious - they, like us - may not even be able to explain it. Nevertheless, they BEHAVE as living and thinking creatures. Are they ?
<br>
<br>
That is the ONLY test that can be applied to ANY coherent system with regard to sentience and life. That is, the test of common sense. If it acts alive and sentient, then it IS alive and sentient. This applies whether it's biological, mechanical, energy forms, or some as yet un-discovered life form that we can't even imagine.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>One final observation. Your argument against computers being alive and thinking seems to be almost spiritual. While you have not come right out and said it, you seem to be implying some special quality of evolved biological life that would make it the ONLY valid form of life. Yet you have no proof that biological life itself wasn't "artificed" or created by some other higher form of life. You also have not shown why a highly complex and seemingly living machine is any different than a highly complex and seemingly living creature. Other than the one being artificed. 
<br>
<br>
Niether life nor mind are some aggregate property of biological life (a theory that smacks of spiritualism if you ask me), but rather life and mind are the simple consequence of a particular kind of ordered complexity. It does not matter what the medium is, be it atoms, carbon and water molecules, energy forms, or mechanical agents.

I wonder if you might address the point, that Turing test requiress of a computer to be able to perfectly deceive human, making him to believe that it is not a computer he is communicating - which seems to be much more hard task than simply to be intelligent.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Sorry, this thread is so long I didn't realize it actually had a "point". But I will happily share my feelings on the Turing Test. First, there are a number of elements that are often used interchangeably by the un-initiated that are in fact totally seperate items. So let's clear that up.
<br>
<br>
1) Intelligence - This is the only thing that the Turing Test was meant to gauge. The Turing Test is measuring a combination of IQ and Mental Aquity.
<br>
<br>
2) Self Awareness - A definitive property, easily produced in software agents. Is simply the agents ability to identify and define boundaries for objects in it's universe - one of which must be itself. The Turing Test was NOT designed to show or measure this.
<br>
<br>
3) Conciousness - A subjective mental state for which NO conclusive test can be performed to test for.
<br>
<br>
Now, the Turing Test is great at what it does, showing how intelligent an agent is. And intelligence is the starting point for reaching and achieving these and other properties and states. But it is not a crystal ball with which to determine things like is the agent concious or self-aware.
<br>
<br>
One problem I see with the Turing Test is the age of the human subjects used. All of my own current MLAI projects have produced entities with the mental aquity of small children. Naturally, if placed in a Turing Test with grown mature adult humans such agents are going to do poorly.
<br>
<br>
Here in the lab, I have begun a practice that I would recomend to others to try. Doing the Turing Test with 6 to 12 year old children. You will be amazed at the results.
<br>
<br>
In summary, the Turing Test is a valuable tool in developement of these MLAI agents - so long as it is seen for what it is. It is just one of many benchmarks and tests used in this field. And that is my take on the Turing Test.

Maybe you could include systems for mreasuring the ifiosyncracies of man too, so that youi oculd list a matrix of actions by behaviouralism, and  program them in?
<br>
<br>
I see in ORIGIN (above0 that a cpnsvcious robot has been built for the first time, that self- modifies, and this has been pubicaly demobstrated.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Self-modification is one way to possibly achive consciousness (which I desxcribe as predictive modellng ability viz a viz the environment and the self)
<br>

but it's good to delineate as you are, and the class perspecytive juggling xan ablso be done by matrixes

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote"> Because the definition of the Turing test will vary from person to person, Turing test-capable machines will not arrive on a single day, and there will be a period during which we will hear claims that machines have passed the threshold. Invariably, these early claims will be debunked by knowledgeable observers, probably including myself. By the time there is a broad consensus that the Turing test has been passed, the actual threshold will have long since been achieved. </p></center>
<br>
A few brief thoughts about strong AI and the Turing test:
<br>
<br>
1. Capability (as Kurzweil implies) is a crucial, if not obvious element;
<br>
2. Possible reponse patterns--(a.)no reponse (unwilling, or unable to repond,(b.)reponse (unintelligle [to the interviewer], intelligent/rational [w/in the interviewer's personal cognitive capability, or other test parameters]).
<br>
3. Once a strong AI develops/evolves, the capability to successfully pass a Turing test doesn't mean it will be willing to participate;
<br>
4. If an AI doesn't answer, does that mean it isn't intelligent?
<br>
5.  If it answers, but sounds neurotic/psychotic, does that indicate lack of intelligence, or do we seat them in the crazy-not-stupid section?
<br>
5. Maybe, the ability to play well with others (i.e., Humans) should be an important design element.
<br>
6. At first, an AI may not be able to respond then (as it evolves) it will want to respond then it may choose not to respond.
<br>
7. Where is strong AI at today, and how do we know?
<br>
