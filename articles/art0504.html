            Published on KurzweilAI.net June 24, 2002.</i>
<p>One day when I was having lunch with <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>, I mentioned 
              to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, 
              "That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard." For 
              Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong 
              or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of 
              lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. 
            </p>
<p>Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, 
              where he supervised the "computers," that is, the people 
              who operated the mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s. There he was <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>al 
              in setting up some of the first plug-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable tabulating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened 
              in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              at MIT. </p>
<p>I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student 
              at the MIT <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates 
              helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              fast enough to solve <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing problems. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, 
              as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, all 
              connected by a <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. We called it a "Connection 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>." Richard, always interested in his son's activities, 
              followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but 
              whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay 
              up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the 
              planned <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> he ever seemed to believe that we 
              were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. 
            </p>
<p>Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. 
              We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing 
              stock, etc. We <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up in an old mansion just outside of the city, 
              and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock 
              of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about anything technical for several months. We were arguing 
              about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked 
              in, saluted, and said, "Richard Feynman reporting for duty. 
              OK, boss, what's my assignment?" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated 
              MIT students was astounded. </p>
<p>After a hurried private discussion ("I don't know, you hired 
              him..."), we informed Richard that his assignment would be 
              to advise on the application of <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a> to scientific 
              problems. </p>
<p>"That sounds like a bunch of baloney," he said. "Give 
              me something real to do." </p>
<p>So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, 
              we decided that the part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that we were most worried 
              about was the <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a> that delivered messages from one processor 
              to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. 
              When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment 
              of analyzing the <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>. </p>
<h2>The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> </h2>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a> was the part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> 
              that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting 
              a separate <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> wire between each pair of processors was 
              impractical since a million processors would require 10<sup>12</sup> 
              wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional 
              hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others 
              directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, 
              many messages would contend for the same wires. The <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>'s job 
              was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam 
              or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a 
              path became free. Our question to <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> was whether we 
              had allowed enough buffers for the <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a> to operate efficiently. 
            </p>
<p>During those first few months, Richard began studying the <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> diagrams as if they were <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. He was willing 
              to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally 
              he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of each of the <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s with pencil and paper. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something 
              to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the 
              furniture and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, hiring the first <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, and arranging 
              for the Defense Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Projects Agency (<a class="thought" href="entries/darpa_entry.html">DARPA</a>) to pay 
              for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable 
              job of focusing on his "assignment," stopping only occasionally 
              to help wire the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> room, <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop, shake hands 
              with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind 
              us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of 
              the company, <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_machines_entry.html">Thinking Machines Corporation</a>, Richard was delighted. 
              "That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I 
              work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the 
              company." </p>
<p>The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our 
              capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 
              64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. 
              We had to design our own <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>s, with processors 
              and a <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, 
              write <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, devise ways of testing processors 
              simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the 
              boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens 
              of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding 
              of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have 
              started. </p>
<h2>'Get These Guys Organized' </h2>
<p>I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over 
              my head. Richard volunteered to help out. "We've got to get 
              these guys organized," he told me. "Let me tell you how 
              we did it at Los Alamos." </p>
<p>Every great man that I have known has had a certain <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and place 
              in their <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> that they use as a reference point; a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when things 
              worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. 
              For Richard, that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. 
              Whenever things got "cockeyed," Richard would look back 
              and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this 
              approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> or packaging or <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, 
              to become the "group leader" in this area, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to 
              the group leaders at Los Alamos. </p>
<p>Part Two of Feynman's "Let's Get Organized" campaign 
              was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers 
              who might have interesting things to do with our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Richard's 
              idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, 
              because they would be less conservative about what kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, 
              a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for 
              building <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s. In 1983, studying <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s was 
              about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered 
              John Hopfield a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> crazy. Richard was certain he would fit 
              right in at <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_machines_entry.html">Thinking Machines Corporation</a>. </p>
<p>What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>], a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> for remembering <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s. To use an associative 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, one trains it on a series of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, such as pictures 
              of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is shown 
              a new <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> it is able to recall a similar <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that it has 
              seen in the past. A new picture of the letter "A" will 
              "remind" the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> of another "A" that it has 
              seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> could 
              be built from <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that were similar to <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. </p>
<p>Not only did Hopfield's <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> seem to work, but it seemed to work 
              well on the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a>. Feynman figured out the details 
              of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, 
              with the strength of the connections represented as <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s in the 
              processors' <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. Because of the parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of Hopfield's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 
              100\% efficiency, so the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a> would be hundreds of 
              times faster than any conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. </p>
<h2>An <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">Algorithm</a> For Logarithms </h2>
<p>Feynman worked out the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for computing Hopfield's <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a> in some detail. The part that he was proudest 
              of was the <a class="thought" href="entries/subroutine_entry.html">subroutine</a> for computing logarithms. I mention it here 
              not only because it is a clever <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>, but also because it is 
              a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. He invented it at Los Alamos. </p>
<p>Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              between 1.0 and 2.0 (the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> can be generalized without too 
              much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> can be uniquely 
              represented as a product of <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of the form 1 + 2<sup>-k</sup>, 
              where k is an <a class="thought" href="entries/integer_entry.html">integer</a>. Testing each of these factors in a <a class="thought" href="entries/binary_entry.html">binary</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> representation is simply a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of a shift and a subtraction. 
              Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by 
              adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> 
              fit especially well on the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a>, since the small table 
              of the logarithms of 1 + 2<sup>-k</sup> could be shared by all the 
              processors. The entire <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> took less <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> than division. 
            </p>
<p>Concentrating on the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> for a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> arithmetic <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> 
              was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>, he paid attention to the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> gate 
              and in writing a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> he insisted on understanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation 
              of every instruction. He distrusted <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>s that could not 
              be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote 
              a general interest article on the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a> for <i>Scientific 
              American</i>, he was disappointed that it left out too many details. 
              He asked, "How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just 
              a bunch of crap?" </p>
<p>Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover 
              the potential of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> for numerical computing and physical 
              simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that the Connection 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> would not be efficient at "number-crunching," 
              because the first prototype had no special <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> for vectors 
              or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were "known" 
              to be requirements for <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>-crunching. Feynman decided to test 
              this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: 
              quantum chromodynamics. </p>
<p>Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of 
              atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>s. Using this theory it is possible, 
              in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, 
              such as a <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>'s mass. In practice, such a <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> requires 
              so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s in the 
              world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a 
              discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of <a class="thought" href="entries/spacetime_entry.html">space-time</a>. 
              Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all 
              of the possible <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s of certain matrices on the links 
              of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This 
              is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this 
              so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> involves multiplying the matrices around every little 
              loop in the lattice, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of loops grows as the fourth 
              power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can 
              take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep 
              all 64,000 processors busy. </p>
<p>To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to 
              write a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for QCD. Since the only <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_language_entry.html">computer language</a> 
              Richard was really familiar with was <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a>, he made up a parallel 
              version of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">Basic</a> in which he wrote the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and then simulated 
              it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a>. 
            </p>
<p>He was excited by the results. "Hey Danny, you're not going 
              to believe this, but that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> of yours can actually do something 
              <i>useful</i>!" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>, even without any special <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> for floating point arithmetic, 
              would outperform a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that CalTech was building for doing QCD 
              calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more 
              toward looking at numerical applications of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. </p>
<p>By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis 
              of the behavior of the <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a>, and much to our surprise and amusement, 
              he presented his answer in the form of a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of partial differential 
              equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              designer, treating a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of boolean <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s as a continuous, differentiable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> strange. Feynman's <a class="thought" href="entries/router_entry.html">router</a> equations were in terms 
              of variables representing continuous quantities such as "the 
              average <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 1 bits in a message address." I was much 
              more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and 
              case analysis than taking the derivative of "the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 
              1's" with respect to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Our discrete analysis said we needed 
              seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only 
              needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. </p>
<p>The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, 
              but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we 
              had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way 
              to solve the problem was to cut the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of buffers per <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> back 
              to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, 
              his unconventional <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of analysis started looking better and 
              better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the 
              smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of buffers. </p>
<p>Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              worked. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> run on the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in April of 1985 was 
              Conway's game of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>. </p>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">Cellular Automata</a> </h2>
<p>The game of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> is an example of a class of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s that 
              interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists 
              who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower 
              levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the 
              bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion 
              is that the "continuum" might, at its lowest levels, be 
              discrete in both <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and that the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> might 
              simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. 
              Each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> could be a simple automaton that obeys a small <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of 
              rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the 
              lattice calculation for QCD. If the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> in fact worked this 
              way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as 
              an upper limit on the density of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> per cubic meter of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. </p>
<p>The notion of <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, 
              whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest 
              in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen 
              Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> models 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he 
              considered their specific models "kooky," but like the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a>, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy 
              to put some <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> into. </p>
<p>There are many potential problems with <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a> as a model 
              of physical <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and time; for example, finding a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules 
              that obeys special <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>. One of the simplest problems is just 
              making the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> so that things look the same in every direction. 
              The most obvious <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>, such as a fixed three-dimensional 
              grid, has preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it 
              possible to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> even Newtonian <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> on a fixed lattice 
              of automata? </p>
<p>Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem, which 
              he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion 
              was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in 
              a regular lattice like a grid or a <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of hexagons, might be 
              randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, 
              on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">Cellular automata</a> started getting attention at <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s 
              when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> at the company, 
              suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, 
              but as a practical <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of simulating physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Specifically, 
              we could use one processor to simulate each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and rules that 
              were chosen to model something useful, like fluid <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a>. For 
              two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy 
              problem since <i>Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau</i> had shown that a 
              hexagonal lattice with a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of rules produced isotropic 
              behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> on the Connection 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a> to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in 
              two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, 
              excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, such as support of floating point arithmetic that 
              would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of 
              simulations in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. </p>
<h2>Feynman the Explainer </h2>
<p>In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to 
              people what we were doing with <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_automata_entry.html">cellular automata</a>. Eyes tended to 
              glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/state_machine_entry.html">finite state machine</a>s. Finally Feynman told us to explain it 
              like this, </p>
<p>"We have noticed in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that the behavior of a fluid depends 
              very little on the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s in that fluid. 
              For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water 
              or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken 
              advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> that 
              is especially simple for us to simulate. This <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> is a perfect 
              ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. 
              The flow of these <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s on a large enough scale is very similar 
              to the flow of natural fluids." </p>
<p>This was a typical <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> explanation. On the one hand, 
              it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because 
              it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they 
              had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since 
              they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> 
              and how it was connected to physical <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. </p>
<p>We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting 
              him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our 
              product introductions. Before the <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> announcement of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/connection_machine_entry.html">Connection Machine</a> CM-1 and all of our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> products, Richard 
              would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. 
              "Don't say `reflected acoustic <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a>.' Say <i>echo</i>." 
              Or, "Forget all that `local minima' stuff. Just say there's 
              a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out." 
              Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. 
            </p>
<p>Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. 
              He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside 
              his claimed area of expertise. Often, at <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s when 
              he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with "That's 
              not my department." I could never figure out just what his 
              department was, but it did not <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> anyway, since he spent most 
              of his <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> working on those "not-my-department" problems. 
              Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would 
              come back a few days after his refusal and remark, "I've been 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about what you asked the other day and it seems to me..." 
              This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. </p>
<p>I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the "dirty 
              work." In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">Thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate 
              soldering <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, 
              or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So 
              why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard 
              didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the 
              rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand 
              as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up 
              first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the 
              truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you 
              feel like a fool. </p>
<p>The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his 
              uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was 
              a sexist. Whenever it came <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for his daily bowl of soup he would 
              look around for the nearest "girl" and ask if she would 
              fetch it to him. It did not <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> if she was the cook, an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er, 
              or the president of the company. I once asked a <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er 
              who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. "Yes, 
              it really annoys me," she said. "On the other hand, he 
              is the only one who ever explained <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> to me as if 
              I could understand it." That was the essence of Richard's charm. 
            </p>
<h2>A Kind Of Game </h2>
<p>Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. 
              Floating point <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> was eventually added to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, and 
              as the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and its successors went into <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> production, 
              they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation 
              problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Richard's 
              interest shifted from the construction of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to its applications. 
              As it turned out, building a big <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is a good excuse to talk 
              to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, 
              biologists, chemists -- everyone of them trying to solve some problem 
              that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how 
              to do these calculations on a parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> requires understanding 
              of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of 
              thing that Richard loved to do. </p>
<p>For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. 
              He always started by asking very <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> questions like, "What 
              is the simplest example?" or "How can you tell if the 
              answer is right?" He asked questions until he reduced the problem 
              to some essential puzzle that he <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> he would be able to solve. 
              Then he would <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring 
              at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle 
              solving he was impossible to interrupt. "Don't <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a> me. I'm 
              busy," he would say without even looking up. Eventually he 
              would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost 
              interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the 
              next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way 
              he worked on problems in <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>es, geophysical modeling, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. 
            </p>
<p>The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. I had written a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that simulated the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of 
              thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the 
              fitness of the population made <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in sudden leaps rather than 
              by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some 
              evidence that real <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> might also exhibit such 
              "punctuated equilibrium," so Richard and I decided to 
              look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and 
              we worked out a model of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of finite populations based on 
              the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to 
              the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and 
              much to my disappointment, all of our "discoveries" were 
              covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard 
              what I had found, he was elated. "Hey, we got it right!" 
              he said. "Not bad for amateurs." </p>
<p>In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked 
              on together, we were both amateurs. In <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s, 
              even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. 
              But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew 
              exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. </p>
<h2>Telling The Good Stuff You Know </h2>
<p>Actually, I doubt that it was "progress" that most interested 
              Richard. He was always <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, for connections, 
              for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation 
              was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas 
              to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until 
              he had taught it to someone else. </p>
<p>I remember a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> we had a year or so before his <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>, 
              walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar 
              trail and Richard, recovering from a major <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> for the <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, 
              was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny 
              story about how he had been reading up on his <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and surprising 
              his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. 
              I was hearing for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> how far his <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> had <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed, 
              so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, 
              because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, "Hey, what's 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>?" </p>
<p>I hesitated. "I'm sad because you're going to die." </p>
<p>"Yeah," he sighed, "that bugs me sometimes too. 
              But not so much as you think." And after a few more steps, 
              "When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've 
              told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway." 
            </p>
<p>We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a 
              place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around 
              at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. "Hey," 
              he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, "I bet I can show 
              you a better way home." </p>
<p>And so he did. </p>
