<br><blockquote><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s ... have penetrated our daily lives and are becoming society's <a class="thought" href="entries/central_nervous_system_entry.html">central nervous system</a>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>- TOHRU MOTO-OKA</blockquote>
<p>TO PREPARE for the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough, society must learn to learn faster. Fact forums will help, but new technologies may help even more. With them, we will be able to spread, refine, and combine our <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> far faster than ever before.</p>
<p>&#160;Information overload has become a well-known problem: pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> pile up too fast for people to sort and make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of them. Thousands of technical journals cover thousands of subjects. Published articles mount by over a million per year. Fact forums help us to clear away falsehoods, which will smooth our efforts to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the world. But any such formal institution will be overwhelmed by the modern flood of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>: fact forums will be able to deal with only a fraction - though an important fraction - of the facts, and they will inevitably be somewhat sluggish. Formal institutions can tap only a tiny fraction of the mental energies of our society.</p>
<p>&#160;Today, our <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s hamper our <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. To see the problem, imagine handling a piece of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>: You uncovered it - how do you spread it? Someone else published it - how do you find it? You found it - where do you file it? You see an error - how do you correct it? Your file grows - how do you organize it?</p>
<p>&#160;We now handle <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> clumsily. Our traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> are vivid and entertaining, but they are ill suited to handling complex, long-term debates; how could you, as a viewer, file, organize, or correct the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a television documentary? In short, how could you make it a well-integrated part of an evolving body of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>? We can handle complex debates better using paper <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, yet the weeks (<i>or years</i>) of delay in a typical publication process slow debate to a crawl. And even paper publications are difficult to file, organize, and correct. <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">Printer</a>s produce bundles of inked paper; through heroic efforts, librarians and scholars manage to link and organize them in a loose fashion. Yet indexes, references, and corrections simply add more pages or more editions, and tracing the links they represent remains tedious.</p>
<p>&#160;Books and other paper bundles work, after a fashion. They hold many of our cultural treasures, and we now have no better way to publish most things. Still, they leave great room for improvement.</p>
<p>&#160;Our trouble in spreading, correcting, and organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> leaves our shared <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> relatively scarce, incorrect, and disorganized. Because established <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is often hard to find, we often do without it, making us seem more ignorant than we need be. Can new technologies help us?</p>
<p>&#160;They have before. The <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the printing press brought great advances; <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based text services promise yet more. To see how our <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could be better, though, it may help to see how they could be worse. Consider, then, an imaginary mess and an imaginary solution:</p><h1>The Tale of the Temple</h1><p>Once upon a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, there lived a people with an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> problem. Though they had replaced their bulky clay tablets with paper, they used it oddly. In the heart of their land stood a stately dome. Beneath the dome lay their great Chamber of Writings. Within this chamber lay a broad mound of paper scraps, each the size of a child's hand.</p>
<p>&#160;From <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, a scholar would journey to this temple of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to offer <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. A council of scribes would judge its worth. If it proved worthy, they would inscribe it on a scrap of paper and ceremoniously fling it upon the heap.</p>
<p>&#160;From <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, some industrious scholar would come to seek <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> - to rummage through the heap in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> of the needed scrap. Some, skilled in such <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, could find a particular scrap in as little as a month. The scribes always welcomed <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers: they were so rare.</p>
<p>&#160;We moderns can see their problem: in a disorderly heap, each added scrap buries the rest (as on so many desks). Every scrap is separate, unrelated to the others, and adding references would provide little help when finding a scrap takes months. If we used such a heap to store <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, our massive, detailed writings on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> would become almost useless. <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a>es would take years, or lifetimes.</p>
<p>&#160;We moderns have a simple solution: we place pages in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>. We place page after page to make a book, book after book to fill a shelf, then fill a building with shelves to make a library. With pages in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, we can find them and follow references more rapidly. If the scribes employed scholars to stack scraps by subject, their <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> would grow easier.</p>
<p>&#160;Yet, when faced with stacks on <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, geography, and <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, where should the scholars put scraps on historical geography, geographical epidemiology, and medical <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>? Where should they put scraps on "The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> of the Spread of the Great Plague"?</p>
<p>&#160;But in our imaginary land, the scribes choose another solution: they send for a magician. But first they turn scholars loose in the chamber with needles and thread to run strands from scrap to scrap. Thread of one color links a scrap to the next in a series, another color leads to a reference, another to a critical note, and so forth. The scholars weave a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of relationships, represented by a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of threads. At last, the magician (with flashing eyes and floating hair) chants a spell, and the whole mess heaves slowly into the air to float like a cloud in the dome. Ever after, a scholar holding a scrap need only tap a thread knotted to its edge to make the linked scrap leap to hand. And the threads, magically, never tangle.</p>
<p>&#160;Now the scholars can link scraps on "The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> of the Spread of the Great Plague" to related scraps on <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, geography, and <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. They can add all the notes and texts they please, linking them to best advantage. They can add special index scraps, able to bring instantly to hand whatever they list. They can place links wherever they wish, weaving a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to match the connections of the real world.</p>
<p>&#160;We, with our inert stacks of paper, could only envy them - if we didn't have <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. &#160;</p><h1>Magic Paper Made Real</h1><p>In 1945, Vannevar Bush proposed a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> he called a "memex." It was to be a desk-sized <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, crammed with microfilm and mechanisms, able to display stored pages and let the user note relationships among them. A microfilm memex was never built, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> lived on.</p>
<p>&#160;Today, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and screens are becoming cheap enough to use for ordinary reading and writing. Some paper publishers have become <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> publishers, making magazines, newspapers, and journals available through <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. And with the right <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, text-handling <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will let us link this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in ways even better than magic thread.</p>
<p>&#160;Theodor Nelson, the originator of the idea, has dubbed the result "<a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>": text linked in many directions, not just in a one-dimensional sequence. Readers, authors, and editors using a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will generally ignore the workings of its <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and screens just as they have generally ignored the mechanics of photocomposition and offset lithography in the past. A <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will simply act like magic paper; anyone who fiddles with it will soon become familiar with its <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> abilities. Still, a description of one <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>'s structure will help in explaining how <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will work.</p>
<p>&#160;In the approach followed by the Xanadu <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> group (in San Jose, California), the core of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> - the back end - is a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> able to store both documents and links between documents. An initial <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> might be a single-user desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>; eventually a growing <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to serve as an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> library. Stored documents will be able to represent almost anything, whether novels, diagrams, textbooks, or <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s - eventually, even <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> or movies.</p>
<p>&#160;Users will be able to link any part of any document to any other. When a reader points to one end of a link (whether it is shown on the screen by underlining, an asterisk, or a picture of colored thread), the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will fetch and display the material at the other end. Further, it will record new versions of a large document without storing additional copies; it need store only the parts that are changed. This will let it inexpensively store the earlier versions of any document published and modified on the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. It will do all this rapidly, even when the total amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> stored becomes immense. A <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could eventually mature into a world <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> library.</p>
<p>&#160;To locate material in most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based text <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, the user must supply key words or obscure codes. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a>, too, will be able to link text to codes, to key words, or even to a simulated card catalog, but most readers will probably prefer just to read and point to links. As Theodor Nelson has remarked, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will be "a new form of reading and writing, in a way just like the old, with quotations and marginalia and citations. Yet it will also be socially self-constructing into a vast new traversable framework, a new literature.</p>
<p>&#160;What the reader will see when browsing through this framework will depend partly on the reader's own part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, the "frontend" <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, perhaps a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>. The back end will just file and fetch documents; the front end will <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> them fetched at the reader's request and will display them to suit the reader's taste.</p>
<p>&#160;To imagine how this will appear to a user, picture a screen the size of this open book, covered with print the size you are reading now-clear print, on a good screen. Today the screen would resemble a television <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>, but within a few years it could be a booklike, lap-sized object with a cord to an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> outlet. (With <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, we can eliminate the cord: a book-sized object will be able to hold a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> containing images of every page in every hook in the world, stored in fast, molecular-tape <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>.)</p>
<p>&#160;In <i>this</i> book - the one now in your hands - I could describe Theodor Nelson's books about <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, <i>Literary <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</i> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a><i> Lib</i>, but you couldn't see them on these pages. Their pages are elsewhere, leaving you trapped for the moment in one author's writings. But if this were a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> and I, or someone else, had added the obvious link, you could point to the words "<i>Literary <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</i>" here, and a moment later the text on the opposite page would clear, to be replaced by Ted Nelson's table of <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s or by my selection of his quotes. From there, you could step into his book and roam through it, perhaps while having your front-end <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> display any notes that I had linked to his text. You could then return here (perhaps now displaying <i>his</i> notes on <i>my</i> text) or move on to yet other documents linked to his. Without leaving your chair, you could survey all the major writings on <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, moving from link to link through any number of documents.</p>
<p>&#160;By keeping track of links (say, between outlines, drafts, and reference materials), <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will help people write and edit more ambitious works. Using <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> links, we can weave our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> into coherent wholes. John Muir observed that "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>." <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will help us keep ideas hitched together in ways that better represent reality.</p>
<p>&#160;With <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, we will be better able to gather and organize <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, increasing our effective <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. But for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> gathering to be effective, it must be decentralized; <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> scattered among many minds cannot easily be put into the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> by a few specializts. The Xanadu group proposes a simple solution: let everyone write, and have the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> automatically pay royalties to the authors whenever readers use their material. Publishing will be easy and people will be rewarded for providing what other people want.</p>
<p>&#160;Imagine what you yourself have wanted to say about ideas and events. Imagine the insightful comments that are even now fading from the memories of both speakers and listeners all over the world. On a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, comments will be easy to publish and easy to find. Imagine the <i>questions</i> that have bothered you. You could publish them, too; someone finding an answer could then publish a reply.</p>
<p>&#160;Since everyone on the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will be able to write text and links, the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> will accumulate great stores of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> and even greater heaps of utter garbage. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will include old news, advertising, graffiti, ranting, and lies - so how will a reader be able to avoid the bad and focus on the good? We could appoint a central editorial committee, but this would destroy the openness of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Sorting <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is itself an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> problem for which <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> fortunately will help us evolve good solutions.</p>
<p>&#160;Since <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will be able to do almost everything that paper <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can, we can at least use the solutions we already have. Publishers have established reputations in the paper-text <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, and many of them have begun to move into <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> publishing. On a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> they will be able to publish on-line documents that meet their established standards. Readers so inclined will be able to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> their front-end <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to display only these documents, automatically ignoring the new garbage. To them, the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will seem to contain only material by established publishers, but material made more available by <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> distribution and by <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> links and indexes. True garbage will still be there (so long as its authors have paid a small storage fee for their material), yet garbage need not intrude on any reader's screen.</p>
<p>&#160;But we will be able to do better than this. Approval of a document (shown by links and recommendations) can come from anyone; readers will pay attention to material recommended by whomever they respect. Conversely, readers who find documents they like will be able to see who has recommended them; this will lead readers to discover people who share their interests and concerns. Indirectly, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will link people and speed the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of communities.</p>
<p>&#160;When publishing becomes so fast and easy, writers will produce more material. Since <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will encourage free-lance editing, editors will find themselves with more work to do. Documents that quote, list, and link other documents will serve as anthologies, journals, or instant-<a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> indexes. The incentive of royalties will encourage people to help readers find what they want. Competing guides to the literature will swiftly appear - and guides to the guides.</p>
<p>&#160;Hypertext links will be better than paper references, and not merely in speed. Paper references let an industrious reader follow links <i>from</i> one document <i>to</i> another - but try finding which documents refer <i>to</i> one you are reading! Today, finding such references requires the cumbersome apparatus of a citation index, available only in <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> libraries, covering limited topics, and months out of date. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> links will work in <i>both</i> directions, letting readers find comments on what they are reading. This means a breakthrough: it will subject ideas to more thorough criticism, making them evolve faster.</p>
<p>&#160;The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> - whether in <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering - requires the generation, spread, and testing of memes. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will speed this process. Paper <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> handle the process of generation and spread fairly well, but they handle testing clumsily.</p>
<p>&#160;Once a bad idea reaches print, it takes on a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of its own, and even its author can seldom drive a stake through its heart. A devastating refutation of the bad idea becomes just another publication, another scrap of paper. Days or years later, readers who encounter the bogus idea will still be unlikely to have chanced upon its refutation. Thus, nonsense lives on and on. Only with the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will critics be able to plant their barbs firmly in the meat of their targets. Only with <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will authors be able to retract their errors, not by burning all the libraries or by mounting a massive publicity campaign, but by revising their text and labeling the old version "retracted." Authors will be able to eat their words quietly; this will give them some compensation for the fiercer criticism.</p>
<p>&#160;Critics will use clear refutations to skewer nonsense (such as false limits to <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>), clearing it from the intellectual arena - though not from the record - almost as soon as it pops into sight. Guides to good criticism will help readers see whether an idea has survived the worst objections yet raised. Today, the absence of known criticism doesn't mean much, because brief critical comments are hard to publish and hard to find. In an established <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, though, ideas that have survived all known criticism will have survived a real challenge. They will gain real and growing credibility.</p><h1>Linking Our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a></h1><p>The advantages of <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> run deep; this is why they will be great. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will let us represent <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in a more natural way. <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> forms an unbroken web, and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> problems sprawl across the fuzzy boundaries between fields. Neat rows of books do a poor job of representing the structure of our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Librarians have labored to make these rows more like nets by inventing better ways to index, reference, and arrange pieces of paper. Yet despite the noble efforts and victories of librarians, library <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> still daunts all but a dedicated minority of the reading public. Libraries have evolved toward <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, yet the mechanics of paper still hobbles them. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will let us take a giant step in a direction we have been moving since the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of writing.</p>
<p>&#160;Our very memories work through associations, through links that make recollections recallable. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> workers also find associations essential to making <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> useful; they <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> what they call "semantic nets" to build <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">knowledge representation</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. On paper, associations among words make a thesaurus useful; in the mind, one's working vocabulary relies on fast, flexible associations among words. Indeed, relationships in <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> supply the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> that gives meaning to our ideas. Using <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, people will associate ideas through published links, enriching their meaning and making them more available - indeed, making them more like parts of our own minds.</p>
<p>&#160;When we change our minds about what the world is like and where it is going, we change our internal <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>ed change often requires that we compare competing patterns of ideas.</p>
<p>&#160;To judge a worldview presented in a book, a reader must often remember or reread explanations from earlier pages - or from a conflicting article seen last year. But <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> is faulty, and digging around in old paper often seems like too much work. Knowing of this problem, authors vacillate between putting too much in (thus boring their readers) and leaving too much out (thus leaving weak spots in their discussions). Inevitably, they do both at once.</p>
<p>&#160;Hypertext readers will be able to see whether linked sources support an idea or linked criticisms explode it. Authors will write pithy, exciting summaries of ideas and link them to the lengthy, boring explanations. As authors expound and critics argue, they will lay out their competing worldview <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s in parallel, point by point. Readers still won't be able to judge ideas instantly or perfectly, but they will be able to judge them faster and better. In this way, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will help us with a great task of our time: judging what lies ahead, and adjusting our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> to prospects that shake the foundations of established worldviews. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will strengthen our foresight.</p>
<p>&#160;By now, many useful applications of a mature <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will be obvious - or as obvious as they can be today, before we have experienced them directly. Carrying news is one such obvious application.</p>
<p>&#160;News shapes our view of the world, but modern <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> sharply limit what reporters can portray. Often, stories about <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and world events only make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in a broader <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, but the limited <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and onrushing deadlines of publishing strip needed <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> from stories. This weakens our grasp of events. Using <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, reporters will find it easy to link today's news to broader background discussions. What is more, the people in the stories and casual observers will be able to have their say, linking their comments to the reporter's story.</p>
<p>&#160;Advertising greases the wheels of the economy, leading (and misleading) us to available products. Well-informed consumers can avoid shoddy, overpriced goods, but the needed <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and comparison shopping gobbles <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. On a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, though, consumer service companies will assemble comparative catalogs, linking descriptions of competing products to one another, to test results, and to reports from consumers.</p>
<p>&#160;In <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, we learn best when we are interested in what we read. But most books present ideas in just one sequence, at just one level of difficulty, regardless of a learner's background or interests. Again, popular demand will favor the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of useful <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>. People will make links between similar presentations written at different levels. Students will be able to read at a comfortable level, peeking at parallel discussions that reach a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> deeper. Hard material will grow easier to handle, because links to primers and <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> definitions will let readers pause for review - instantly, privately, and without embarrassment. Other links will lead in all directions to related material; links in a description of a coral reef will lead to both texts on reef <a class="thought" href="entries/ecology_entry.html">ecology</a> and tales of hungry sharks. When we can gratify momentary interests almost instantly, <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> will become more fun. More people might then find it addictive.</p>
<p>&#160;Due process will thrive in <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>. Because it will be open to all sides, and will allow questioning, response, and so forth, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> debate will have an inherent due-process quality. Indeed, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will be an ideal medium for conducting fact forums. Forum procedures, in turn, will complement <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> by distilling its wide-ranging debates into a clear (though tentative) statement of key technical facts.</p>
<p>&#160;In a final obvious effect, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will reduce the problem of out-of-<a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> quotes: readers will be able to make the original <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> reappear around any quote in the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> at the touch of a button. This will be valuable, and not just to prevent misrepresentation of an author's position; indirect benefits may <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> more. <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">Reason</a>able statements torn loose from their background can seem absurd, but <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> authors will know that "absurd" quotations will lead readers directly back to the author's original <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. This will encourage bolder writing, giving memes based on evidence and <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> an advantage over those based on mere convention and timidity.</p>
<p>&#160;Perhaps the most important (yet least vivid) benefit of <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will be a new ability to see <i>absences</i>. To survive the coming years, we must evaluate complex ideas correctly, and this requires judging whether an argument is full of holes. But today we have trouble seeing holes.</p>
<p>&#160;Still more difficult is recognizing the <i>absence</i> of fatal holes, yet this is the key to recognizing a sound argument. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will help us. Readers will scrutinize important arguments, attaching conspicuous objections where they find holes. These objections will make holes so consistently visible that an <i>absence</i> of good objections will clearly indicate an <i>absence</i> of known holes. It may be hard to appreciate how important this will he: the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind tends not to recognize the problems caused by our inability to see the absence of holes, to say nothing of the opportunities this inability makes us miss.</p>
<p>&#160;For example, imagine that you have an idea and are trying to decide whether it is sound and worth publishing. If the idea isn't obvious, you might doubt its truth and not publish it. But if it does seem obvious, you might well assume that it has already been published, but that you just can't find out where. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a>, by making things much easier to find, will make it easier to see that something has <i>not</i> been published. By making holes in our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> more visible, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will encourage hole-filling.</p>
<p>&#160;To understand and guide <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we need to find the errors-including omissions - in complex technological proposals. Because we do this poorly, we make many mistakes, and the visibility of these mistakes makes our incompetence a vivid and menacing fact. This encourages prudence, yet it can also encourage paralysis: because we have difficulty seeing holes, we fear them everywhere, even where they do not exist. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will help build confidence, where confidence is justified, by exposing problems more reliably.</p><h1>Dangers of <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a></h1><p>Like most useful tools, <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> could be used to do harm. Though it will help us keep track of facts, it could also help <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s keep track of us. Yet, on balance, it may serve liberty. Designed for decentralization - with many <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, many writers, many editors - <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> may help citizens more than it helps those who would rule them. <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> banks are growing anyway. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s might even help us keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>&#160;Relying on <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> publishing holds another danger. <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a>s in the United States and elsewhere have often interpreted the ideal once expressed as "freedom of speech" and "of the press" to mean only freedom to talk and to sell inked paper. <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a>s have regulated the use of radio and television, requiring them to serve a bureaucracy's shifting notion of the public interest. Practical limitations on the number of broadcasting channels once gave some excuse for this, but those excuses must stop here. We must extend the principles of free speech to new <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;We would be horrified if the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> ordered agents into libraries to burn books. We should be equally horrified when the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> seeks to erase public documents from <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> libraries. If <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> is to carry our traditions, then what is published must remain so. An <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> library will be no less a library for its lack of shelves and paper. Erasure will make no flame and smoke, but the stench of book-burning will remain.</p><h1>From Desktop to World Library</h1><p>Some of the benefits I have described will only result from a large, highly evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> - one already serving as a forum for broad debates and on its way to becoming a world <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> library. Such a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> may not have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to mature before the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> breakthroughs arrive. For <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> to get off the ground, small <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s must have practical applications, and for <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> to help us handle the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race, small <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s must have an effect beyond their size. Fortunately, we can expect substantial benefits almost from the outset.</p>
<p>&#160;Individual <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to serve several users at once. Even without linking to anything in the outside world, they will help companies, associations, and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> groups handle complex <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Outside links will be easy, though. The number of publicly available <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> bases has grown from a few dozen in the mid-1960s to a few hundred in the mid-1970s to a few thousand in the mid-1980s. Companies have made these available through <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be able to fetch material from these <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> bases, storing the <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> codes instead of the actual text. This <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> will only <i>seem</i> to be in the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, but that will be good enough for many purposes.</p>
<p>&#160;People will use early <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to provide a community with a dialup service like that of existing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> bulletin boards but better. Special-interest discussion groups have already emerged on <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s; they will find <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> a better medium for exchanging <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and views.</p>
<p>&#160;Early <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will also help us build and run organizations. Ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> conferencing (simply sending short messages back and forth) already helps groups communicate. Advantages over face-to-face conferences include lower costs (no need to travel), smoother interactions (no need to wait or to interrupt people), and a better meeting of minds (through clearer messages and fewer personality clashes). <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s will extend these benefits by giving participants better tools for referencing, comparing, and summarizing. Because <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> debates will need no single editor, they will allow organizations to become more open.</p>
<p>&#160;Using a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> service by telephone from a home <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> during off-peak hours will probably cost several dollars per hour at first. This cost will fall over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. For several decades now, the real cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s has dropped by about a factor of ten every ten years; the cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s has also declined. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be affordable to a substantial number of people almost as soon as they become available. Within ten years, the costs seem likely to fall low enough for mass-market use.</p>
<p>&#160;Electronic publishing is already catching on. The <i>Academic American Encyclopedia</i>, structured as a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>, has been made available to 90,000 subscribers, including 200 libraries and eight schools. <i><a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a></i> magazine reports that children use it eagerly. Terminals in libraries already can <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the text of scores of newspapers, magazines, and professional journals.</p>
<p>&#160;We won't need to wait for a universal <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> to enjoy universal benefits, because <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will begin to make a difference very early. We need <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> in the hands of students, writers, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers, and managers for the same <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that we need textbooks in schools, <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s in laboratories, and tools in workshops. Some books have made a great difference, even when read by fewer persons than one in a thousand, because they have sent new ideas rippling across society. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will do likewise, helping to refine ideas that will then spread more widely through the established print and broadcast <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> and Printing Press</h1><p>How will the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> revolution compare to the Gutenberg revolution? Some numbers suggest the answer.</p>
<p>&#160;Printing with movable type cut the cost of books dramatically. In the fourteenth century, the King's Advocate of France had only seventy-six books, yet this was considered a large library. Books embodied weeks of skilled labor - copyists were <i>literate</i>. The peasant masses could neither afford books nor read them.</p>
<p>&#160;Today, a year's labor can pay for thousands of books. Many homes hold hundreds; large libraries hold millions. Printing cut the cost of books by a hundredfold or more, setting the stage for mass literacy, mass <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, and the ongoing world revolution of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and democracy.</p>
<p>&#160;And <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>? Gutenberg showed Europe how to arrange metal type to print pages; <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will let us rearrange stored text and send it cross-country at the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. Printing put stacks of books in the home and mountains of books in libraries; <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> will in effect bring these mountains of books to every terminal. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will extend the Gutenberg revolution by increasing the quantity of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> available.</p>
<p>&#160;Yet its other advantages seem greater. Today, following a reference in a library typically takes minutes; with luck, a few hundred seconds - but it can take days or more, if the material is unpopular and hence absent, or too popular and hence missing. <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">Hypertext</a> will cut this delay from hundreds of seconds to about one second. Thus where the Gutenberg revolution reduced the labor cost of <i>producing</i> text by several hundredfold, the <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a> revolution will reduce the labor cost of <i>finding</i> text by several hundredfold. This will be a revolution indeed.</p>
<p>As I have discussed, making links more convenient will change the texture of text, bringing a revolution not merely in quantity but in quality. This increase in quality will take many forms. Better indexes will make <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> easy to find. Better critical discussion will weed out nonsense and help sound ideas thrive. Better presentation of wholes will highlight the holes in our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;With abundant, available, high-quality <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, we will seem more intelligent. And this will increase our chances of handling the coming breakthroughs <i>right</i>. What could be more useful? Next <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you see a lie being spread or a bad decision being made out of sheer ignorance, pause, and think of <a class="thought" href="entries/hypertext_entry.html">hypertext</a>.</p>
