            </p>
            <p>You are a young 19-year-old (note: this kid represents me, as I will be 19 in 2010) walking down the street as you spy the latest news <a class="thought" href="#">flash</a> coming in on the E-paper newspaper. You watch as it says:
              First
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings on Mars!!! You run as fast as your legs will take you to the nearest TV, where you watch the live camera feed from Mars. (Later you find
              out
              the newspaper was soon to headline "Martians Detected!!!")</p>
            <p>You hop in your car. That's all you do, except for placing your finger on a series of 5 fingerprint readers to enter a <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> and accurate fingerprint.
              After this, you say: "I want to go to WAL&#183;MART."</p>
            <p>A small screen pops up from the otherwise entirely featureless dashboard. At its top is a small projector which displays and says in a <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a>
              voice:
              Which Wal-Mart location is your destination? Touch your answer. You begin to touch the glowing WM closest to the red spot representing your current location, when you realize you forgot to check the <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a>
              (as that red spot could have easily been wrong).</p>
            <p>If I had forgotten to do this calibration, you think, there could have easily been an accident. But no, that can't be right, because cars these days don't have accidents unless two <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s
              break plus the <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> isn't calibrated. That's good news, but before the backup/double-backup <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>,
              accidents were happening with the highest frequency in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of automobiles.</p>
            <p>You have by now calibrated your <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. You are cruising
              along
              the informay, halfheartedly attempting to make some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> out of the constant sequence of neatly uniform hex numbers. Sliding a slider down the
              screen
              results in English readouts and coherent speech instead of awful <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a> representing somehow the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>
              being used to keep you from accidents.</p>
            <p>Soon you hear: "To WAL&#183;MART take exit 77 on informay 95." Your car gently veers toward the right, making a turn off the 3-level, 8-lane-wide informay onto a 1-level, 2-lane-wide exit ramp with little antennas to the side to
              help
              guide the car along. The informay has given very accurate directions to the car, and now you are on the 2-level, 6-lane-wide cruiseway, a local road in the form of a beltway.</p>
            <p>The way the roads are arranged, the US is divided into a series of square "plots," not dissimilar to city blocks. Within them is a cruiseway, which is a circle tangent to the square as in the diagram.<br>
              <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080316123140im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/dalrymplefuture1.gif" vspace="10"><br>
              <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>It shows the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> plan. The sides of the squares are the informays, the corners their intersections. The circles represent the cruiseways, and the
              outer circle is the major cruiseway, which you are on now. The lines cutting through are highways, the familiar types, 1-level, 4-lane-wide roads. They have antennas along the sides to help guide the car, but only informays and
              cruiseways say meaningful things to the car. Within the arc-shaped blocks formed by highways and cruiseways are the local roads, 1-level, 2-lane-wide, and these go to individual buildings, although some of these buildings are on
              highways
              (with exit ramps).</p>
            <p>You now turn from the cruiseway, onto a highway headed toward the center. It is not two minutes before you are on a local road, at this point with three lanes, and you, from the third, turn into WAL&#183;MART. Your car is now taking
              info from the WAL&#183;MART itself, and while it finds the closest parking <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, by <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>
              from pressure sensors on the parking spaces, the screen asks what you would like to buy. You tell the car you are lazy and then the car parks, and tells you to get the cart marked "PRZQ".</p>
            <p>Just before you get out of the car, the dashboard pops up a credit card slider. You swipe the card, then close the car door, as a cart comes rolling toward your car. This all happened because you have a special edition model. Most
              people would have to actually go in the store, buy his/her stuff, and "cart" it back to his/her car. The cart, marked PRZQ, contains a LA-Z-BOY chair. You grab it, and it displays its 5 fingerprint readers for you to prove you are
              who
              bought the merchandise by punching in a 5 digit <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> that corresponds to your car while it checks your fingerprints with each touch and after you have
              been authorized, the cart releases the straps around the chair for you to get it. You enter your car's <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>, and then the cart appears to turn off as
              you
              load the chair into your trunk.</p>
            <h1>2020</h1>
            <p>You are <u>very</u> excited, after you just came back from the doctor's office with your wife! She <u>doesn't</u> have uterine <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, she's
              pregnant!
              The doctor's response was "That's not a cyst, baby!" When asked to explain, the doctor said the "cyst" was a baby in early stages. The pill was soon given (Note: this pill is scheduled to be available to doctors in 2002). This pill
              released a camera, which took motion pictures of the baby. A receptor around the waist received pictures and displayed them on a video-screen strapped to the belt. The only problem occurred when one of the baby's legs swung back, and
              his
              body tilted forward. The leg got closer and closer, then the screen went white, and finally static was displayed. It appears the baby has kicked and destroyed the camera. Oh well. Another pill, please?</p>
            <h1>Later...</h1>
            <p>Baby has been born. Unfortunately, that is its name: baby. You are pressed to think of two names for, this <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> child of yours. Ralph Albert
              Dalrymple
              would be RAD. Then again, maybe you'll name him David Allen Dalrymple II. That would make him DAD 2, or granddad. Not such a bad idea. Yes it is. You decide to consult your eyeglasses' (you aren't vision impaired, but you want <a class="thought"
                href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> a little closer than your fingertips--at your
              eyeballs) <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of names. "Steer clear of Cameron!," you say, as you note the name means "crooked nose."</p>
            <p>After finally naming the child <a class="thought" href="entries/edison_entry.html">Thomas Edison</a>, you need a blood test for Tommy. So the little palette used for blood tests is placed gently on
              Tommy's
              skin, and the palette immediately spits out a PCMCIA III card, which contains the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that Tommy seems to be abnormal.</p>
            <p>The news is broken to you, before you are told Tommy has too many <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> connections. This news comes in after a painless <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-mapping
              test. When Tommy is turned over, both you and your wife nearly faint.</p>
            <p>
              <i>Oh, how far </i><a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a><i> has come,</i> you try to think as you gaze at the built in CD player, <a class="thought" href="entries/floppy_disk_entry.html">floppy
                disk</a> drive, two USB ports, an I-Link <a class="thought" href="entries/port_entry.html">port</a>, a modem, and two PCMCIA slots that accommodate 2 I's or 2 IIs, or 1 III and 1 I all on the back of
              Tommy's head. You and your wife can't take it. Falling down and fainting, the child is soon provided with the dictionary, encyclopedia, and almost every other book or fact available on CD or the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>.</p>
            <p>Within the week, this baby Borg is the smartest <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>,
              because he has <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the whole Net and a 20 ZB <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. You
              decide this kid is too weird, and ship him off on his own antigravity rocket to Mars, although you suspect he will use Mars as a 2-month stop to then go off to Alpha Centuari or farther.</p>
            <p>Your suspicions came to be. Tom has built a <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> station near Sirius, the brightest <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>'s sky. By using his own <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, he sends Morse
              <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> messages down to <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> by operating a huge flap on his <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>
              station. It blinds out the <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a>, as it is seen from <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>.
              Other astronauts have adopted this <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Tom has become a short-term chronaut (<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-traveling
              1 hour at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>), as well, by improving a so-called "<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>"

              and eventually on the Web. The <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s documented as entering the world from Sirius are numerous. One of the notable ones was a <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>-controlled
              dashboard. Of course, by now, it's 2022, so I'm getting ahead of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>

            <h1>2030</h1>
            <p>By now you are nearing 40, and it's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to get those financial plans in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>
              for retirement. Perhaps you should go online? You sit down in a 50-year-old chair, and <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a> on those audio-visual <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>s.
              Your personal <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>, and your friend Sonny Microsystems (similar to <a class="thought" href="entries/ramona_entry.html">Ramona</a>),
              instantly appears in front of you (along with, of course, Cher Processingpower). You have a conversation with Sonny about retirement, as he plays with the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search
                engine</a>, which within 5 seconds has done its job. You continue to talk, and Sonny draws info from the Web to make recommendations and display virtual Web sites. You eventually choose Charles "Cue Tip" Schwab as your retirement
              plan.
              You relax, but try as you might, you simply cannot think of where <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will go next...</p>
