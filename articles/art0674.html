<div class="TeaserText">Molecular manufacturing increases the potential for high-tech crimes; it can also be used to prevent them, says a crime analyst and book author.</div>
<br>

<p><i>Originally published in </i><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">Perception</a>s: A Review 
              of Ultraprecision <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering and Nanotechnology, Volume 2, No. 
              2<i>, May 8, 2006. Reprinted May 24, 2006 by KurzweilAI.net.</i></p>
<p>The anticipated emergence of molecular manufacturing (MM) within 
              decades requires new <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ualizations about crime and new strategies 
              to address it. The seeds of possible solutions are planted in the 
              United Kingdom where formal policing began. These seeds are called 
              "crime <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>."<sup>i</sup></p>
<p>Early policing stressed that the principal duty of police was to 
              prevent crime rather than detect it.<sup>ii</sup> Crime science 
              focuses on using science in creative and unprecedented ways to prevent 
              crime.</p>
<p>What type of crime will occur in a world with MM? If the terrorist 
              activities of this decade so far are indicators, it is likely that 
              fundamentalist reactions to science will result in terrorist acts 
              against scientists who threaten world <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> as we know it. This 
              alone is cause for examining how we might prevent crime, as preventing 
              crime is similar to preventing <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a>. Since much of the crime 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will be enabled by new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, it will be necessary 
              to develop strategies to prevent the abuse of technology.</p>
<p>We use little science in policing <i>strategies</i> today, despite 
              the enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in technology in the past century. Tools have 
              improved, but advanced strategies are rare. We use police cars instead 
              of horse and buggies; citizens call 911 from <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phones and officers 
              come running to almost every single request for police help; we 
              have better <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, better <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, and better <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>. 
              Most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, however, we do not assess why police keep running 
              to the same locations and dealing with the same problems.</p>
<p>Too often today, we look at crime incident by incident. In <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, 
              this would be like studying each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> case separately 
              to find a way to combat that one particular infection. Finding practical 
              ways to prevent, contain, and minimize crime by studying it in aggregations&#8212;as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> scientists study strains of viruses&#8212;with <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive 
              measures and creative solutions: this is what policing in the world 
              of the future will demand.</p>
<p>Only the most progressive agencies, very few in <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, have a 
              grasp of how to maximize the <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> made <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible 
              by technology, to turn it into a resource for better policing. The 
              status of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> in the United States is a disaster, 
              not only on the federal level (in the FBI), but also in most local 
              law enforcement agencies&#8212;the first responders to crime and 
              to terrorism.<sup>iii</sup> Fear of Big Brother and of losing civil 
              liberties is not unreasonable, considering the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of existing 
              technologies to monitor people. However, at least in policing, we 
              are moving toward a more transparent <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>.<sup>iv</sup> (The 
              ability to track officers with <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a>, and the ubiquitous surveillance 
              cameras on police cars are examples of transparency in police work.) 
              That said, the truth is that very little analysis of information 
              on repeat offenders, on crime hot spots, on serial crimes&#8212;the 
              very things the police are charged with knowing &#8212;exists today. 
              In many cases, we do not need more <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> or secret information 
              to prevent crime and arrest dangerous offenders. We just need to 
              learn how to analyze the information we already have.</p>
<p>In a world with molecular manufacturing, more information will 
              become available in real time; thus, the capacity to create <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>able 
              information will grow, but its <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> will benefit society only 
              if the police know how to maximize information as a resource.</p>
<p>Because of the mystique and mythology surrounding police, as reflected 
              on television and in movies, the ability of civilians to question 
              police work is impaired. They believe the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> version of how to 
              be a good cop. The good cop always gets the bad guy, and this may 
              be the mindset of most people for the post-MM world: who will be 
              the enemies, and how can we defeat them? But perhaps these are the 
              wrong questions.</p>
<p>Recently, at a national focus group in Washington on intelligence 
              and crime analysis, Dr. Jerry Ratcliffe<sup>v</sup> cited a study 
              showing that out of every 1000 crime occurrences (including the 
              one-quarter of these that go unreported), only <i>four</i> persons 
              are convicted of a crime. Even if this figure is not reliable across 
              all policing jurisdictions, the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that our entire criminal 
              justice <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> depends on catching a few bad people and locking 
              them up rather than researching and funding measures to reduce the 
              opportunities or motivations to commit crime.</p>
<p>How can crime science make a difference? Why does molecular manufacturing 
              make it even more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant?</p>
<p>Three core premises change the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of "fighting crime."</p>
<p>The first premise is that criminal behavior and disorder are much 
              more common than we realize, and that offenders are often very similar 
              to you and me &#8211; in fact, they sometimes are you and me. How 
              often have you gone over the speed limit? When you were a teen, 
              did you break minor laws? The moral outrage at crime usually is 
              reserved for the "other," the person who is not you. Crime science 
              acknowledges habitual offenders and studies ways to prevent their 
              crimes (as well as identifying those who should be fully prosecuted 
              because of recidivist behavior). However, it also opens the curtain 
              to reveal that crime is not always a battle of good against bad. 
              MM in the hands of "good" people still may result in crime.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement of the potential "shadow" in each of us is 
              a best practice when developing MM. While not something stressed 
              in the emerging field of crime science, it is a view supported by 
              Carl Jung.</p>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, there can be no doubt that man is, on the 
              whole, less goodthan he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone 
              carries a shadow, andthe less it is embodied in the individual's 
              conscious <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, the blacker anddenser it is. If an inferiority is 
              conscious, one always has a chance tocorrect it. Furthermore, it 
              is constantly in contact with other interests, sothat it is continually 
              subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed andisolated from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, it never gets corrected.<sup>vi</sup></blockquote>
<p>The second premise in crime science is that crime occurs where 
              there is opportunity, and that opportunity itself can be a cause 
              of crime. Using a system approach to problem solving, designing 
              MM with built in crime prevention <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s would be a best practice.<sup>vii</sup></p>
<p>The third premise is that existing criminal justice systems will 
              <i>never</i> be good enough to deal with modern crime opportunities&#8212;and 
              MM will certainly prove this premise correct.<sup>viii</sup></p>
<p>Although there are multitudes of criminal justice and criminology 
              degree <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, little focus has been placed on the scientific 
              study of crime prevention in universities and colleges. Those academics 
              that have chosen to focus on this area often are marginalized by 
              their peers. Obviously, because of the severity of the dangers posed 
              by MM, preventing criminal activities is optimal when compared to 
              reacting to their consequences. Academia must respond to this urgent 
              need to bring a multiple-disciplinary approach to crime prevention, 
              incorporating all the various sciences to this task. A serious examination 
              of the efficiency and effectiveness of our current systems of policing, 
              courts, and studies is necessary prior to the arrival of MM. This 
              should lead to subsequent major reforms, dynamic in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> to adapt 
              to a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>Who will be policing the world when MM comes to be? Who do you 
              want to be policing this world? How do you want it policed? In 2002, 
              in the United States, police and detectives held 840,000 jobs and 
              approximately 81% (680,400) were local-level law enforcers.<sup>ix</sup> 
              According the International Association of Chiefs of Police, based 
              on facts from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only 9% of local-level 
              law enforcement agencies required their officers to have an associate's 
              degree, and only 2% required them to have a bachelor's degree.<sup>x</sup></p>
<p>Molecular manufacturing means we need to create a much better educated 
              police force. MM means we need to think in terms of built-in crime 
              preventative measures&#8212;the prevention of opportunity for crime. 
              MM means we need to rethink the emphasis on individual justice and 
              begin a sincere quest to bring science beyond the thin blue line, 
              before it is too late. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Law enforcement activities can be neatly separated into two paths; reactive and proactive. The bulk of police activity is centered on the reactive duties because they are more pressing to the public. When a crime is committed, people expect the police to arrive in a timely fashion, investigate, recover property and place the bad guys in jail. These duties are measurable and can easily be trotted out during budget time to justify expenses. The proactive side is much more nebulous and difficult to categorize. Crime prevention is not really accurately measurable. Oh, you can always point to statistics and claim reductions, but history and a true examination of all factors affecting the statistics will skew the numbers and can generally invalidate most claims. 
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> That said, the truth is that very little analysis of information on repeat offenders, on crime hot spots, on serial crimes'the very things the police are charged with knowing 'exists today. In many cases, we do not need more intelligence or secret information to prevent crime and arrest dangerous offenders. We just need to learn how to analyze the information we already have. </p></center>
<br>
This is simply not the case at all. Ask any beat cop where the high crime areas are and he can tell you without breaking stride. We can't use that information to lock down parts of the country because in addition to the crooks there are law-abiding people living there too. And who has the time for it anyway? If we had to watch each previous offender on the suspicion that they will eventually commit another crime, the man hours involved in that sort of surveillance are grossly prohibitive - and don't take into account first time offenders.
<br>
<br>
The real issue is education of the public and non-victim apathy. Proactive measures work best when law enforcement and the people they are charged with protecting work together. This why community based policing is superior to the big-city shotgun do-it-my-way-or-else approach. Based on my personal observations almost no one takes advantage of the simple crime prevention techniques published by most law enforcement agencies. Most people get auxiliary locks and alarms, or write down serial numbers AFTER the crime has been committed.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Who will be policing the world when MM comes to be? Who do you want to be policing this world? How do you want it policed? In 2002, in the United States, police and detectives held 840,000 jobs and approximately 81% (680,400) were local-level law enforcers. According the International Association of Chiefs of Police, based on facts from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only 9% of local-level law enforcement agencies required their officers to have an associate's degree, and only 2% required them to have a bachelor's degree. </p></center>
<br>
Yet another example of someone confusing education with intelligence. Most of the best local cops I've known do not have college degrees. Most of the federal agents I know do have college degrees and it does not seem to help them in their daily law enforcement duties. When they become administrators they seem better at pushing paper around, but that's about it. This doesn't mean that cops should not be educated. However, they should be educated where it matters, in their chosen field of expertise. When MM becomes a threat, I'll trade you 20 English or Math Majors in patrol cars for 1 who went to 3 weeks of intense law enforcement related MM training. 
<br>
<br>
Even if you ignore me on this point, finding people with degrees who are willing to do police work is not easy. Law enforcement tends to pick up the better educated candidates only when the economy takes a nosedive. Agencies with high educational hiring standards often have trouble filling slots, so they will hire any nitwit with a degree. Unfortunately, college based higher education has little or nothing to do with what makes a good cop. This is the fallacy produced by too much CSI:whatever on television. I'd rather take a good investigator and train him in what he needs for MM, than take some MM genius and try and turn him into a cop.</p></td>
