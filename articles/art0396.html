<div class="TeaserText">The fertile ground of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> has led to countless innovations, eliminating physical barriers and allowing a borderless, transparent source of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to flourish. How will the story of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> be played out in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century?</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published January 24, 2002 at KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>Lawrence Lessig's <i>The </i><i>Future</i><i> of Ideas: The fate of the commons in the connected world</i> is a clear, concise vision of what the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is, its <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> (and its prehistory, in real-world analogs of public spaces), the legal issues that surround and permeate it, and where the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> may be headed.</p>
<p>One of Lessig's objectives is to make sure we understand the technical revolution that created the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. He guides the reader through its <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, explaining technical details in a measured, lucid fashion often grounded in real-world metaphors for the non-technical. In an area of writing that often includes fever-pitched techno-enthusiasm and evangelism, Lessig's explanations of <a class="thought" href="entries/mp3_entry.html">MP3</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the difference between GPL and <a class="thought" href="entries/open_source_entry.html">open source</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/tcpip_entry.html">TCP/IP</a> and other elements of the online world help diffuse the mystery behind jargon that furthers the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> divide between its initiates and those to whom it is unfamiliar.</p>
<p>This <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> lesson in <i>The </i><i>Future</i><i> of Ideas</i> is necessary for Lessig to alert us to legal developments that, in his view, threaten how we <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--that, if left unchecked, could change the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> from an open, democratic (albeit chaotic) and interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of data to something resembling closed-<a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> television.</p>
<p>For Lessig, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> represents a "commons," a public space that is shared by those who use it and owned by none. Its use is regulated, to greater and lesser extents, by two forces--the strong hand of the state and the <a class="thought" href="entries/invisible_hand_entry.html">invisible hand</a> of the market. He attributes innovations born over the wires of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, as well as the birth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> itself, to its public, common <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Roads are the metaphor he employs to illustrate the benefit of shared, unowned spaces: the vehicles that use them are owned and must meet state-imposed regulations, but the road itself only enhances the value of other materials--vehicles or property--which use it.</p>
<p>A facet of this commons is that the road itself is simple and unintelligent, like the <a class="thought" href="entries/tcpip_entry.html">TCP/IP</a> based <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. By placing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in the vehicles--the servers and PCs at the end of the wires, the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> itself remains unintelligent, and therefore cannot discriminate what travels over it. This feature of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--what Lessig terms e2e, for end-to-end--has kept it a common space. This space is layered, and using NYU law professor Yochai Benkler's model, Lessig reduces the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> to three layers--physical, code and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>. The physical layer has been built e2e, which allows the code and thus the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> to flow freely thereby enabling collaboration and innovation .</p>
<p>Lessig summarily shows how each layer of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is being changed by forces of the state, the market, and the effect of the two in concert. The result is ownership of layers, a <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> which Lessig believes will by its very <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> add <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> to these layers--thus changing indiscriminate flow of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> into something that can be filtered or directed.</p>
<p>One example Lessig cites in terms of the physical layer of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is the merger of AOL and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Warner, which joins America's largest ISP (in terms of membership) with a provider of media via cable. Prior to this merger, AOL supported "open <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>" to <a class="thought" href="entries/broadband_entry.html">broadband</a> cable networks, and <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> intervention to ensure the separation between the media <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> flowing over <a class="thought" href="entries/broadband_entry.html">broadband</a> lines and the choice of ISPs available to the consumer to gain <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. Post-merger, AOL's stance is to let the market regulate itself. The danger? As Lessig quotes <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> founder <a class="thought" href="entries/berners-lee_entry.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, " keeping media and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> separate...is a good rule in most media. When I turn on the television, I don't expect it to deliberately jump to a particular channel, or to give a better picture when I choose a channel that has the 'right' commercials." He uses the cases of <a class="thought" href="entries/napster_entry.html">Napster</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/mp3_entry.html">MP3</a>.com, <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>, and others to illustrate the shifting <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the code and <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> layers of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> as courts interpret <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a> law in ways that, Lessig argues, restrict public use and distribution of code, <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and ideas themselves.</p>
<p>Lessig provides suggestions for reform to existing law that would maintain this balance between public and private ownership of virtual space (and the ideas that grow there), thus keeping the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> fertile. Among many examples is one in which copyrights on <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> expire after five years; it can be renewed if the author wishes, but will become public (<a class="thought" href="entries/source_code_entry.html">source code</a> and all) if the author does not act. This seems like <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> when one considers how quickly <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> can advance in five years (he points out how absurd it is that existing law protects <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for up to ninety-five years, far past the point of obsoletion).</p>
<p>Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, in his debates with <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> (and others) over the possible futures of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, often uses the phrase "promise and peril" to describe the double-edged sword of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050218030221/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0156.html" target="_self">Promise and Peril</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050218030221/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0358.html" target="_self">Are We Becoming an Endangered Species?</a>). How can the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies be promoted without the risk of destructive misuse? A fine balance between private competition and <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> regulation must be struck in order to keep <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> from being exploited for destructive ends.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lawrence Lessig finds promise and peril in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. It was born without much regulation or guidance, public or private. It has been used both constructively and destructively. For Lessig, the promise is in the innovations that have blossomed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of its original iteration. Conversely, Lessig sees peril in how it may be guided (or over-guided) by state and market forces.</p>

Thanks for an excellent review of the book. Your thorough coverage allowed me to determine that Lessig offers a complete view of the concept of common spaces as well as some constructive suggestions for changing our current trend toward overbearing ownership and regulation.
