<br><p>Originally published January 20, 2001 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060427131806/http://www.upside.com/texis/mvm/story?id=3a5e18841" target="_new">Upside.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 31, 2001.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a> grew up in Queens, N.Y., the son of an artist and a musician who fled Hitler in 1938. By age 12 he had written a <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for statistics, which led him toward a lifelong interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. As a winner of the Westinghouse <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Talent <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a>, with the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>-composition <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, he made an early appearance at the White House to meet with President Lyndon B. Johnson. </p>
<p>From this early start as a wunderkind, Kurzweil has become a self-described inventor, specializing in the areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> he originated with his analysis of classical <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> for the Westinghouse project. </p>
<p>After founding several companies with his name--<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_music_systems_entry.html">Kurzweil Music Systems</a>, Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> and others--he continues to run new companies, sits on the boards of other startups, and is the author of several books, including the best-selling "The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>." </p>
<p>UPSIDE: So there you are, a high school student, you've already had your 15 minutes of fame at the ripe old age of 17--then what? </p>
<p>Kurzweil: It was, in fact, exactly 15 minutes. Then I went to MIT. I actually had a correspondence with Robert Minsky for a couple of years. I had a fascination with <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. And even though it really wasn't apparent at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, Minsky had a strong interest in things like neural nets and other methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. </p>
<p>U: What was <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> like at MIT then? </p>
<p>K: MIT had one main <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for all its students and professors. It was an <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> 7094 with 32,000 words of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. They were 36-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> words, so it was equivalent to 150,000 bytes, a quarter of a <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a>. You submitted your job on <a class="thought" href="entries/punch_card_entry.html">punch card</a>s. If you got a comma wrong, you had to wait another day to get your job run again. And that actually instilled in me some habits I still have today. </p>
<p>U: What did you study at MIT? </p>
<p>K: I took all the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> courses. There were only nine <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> courses at MIT in 1965. I took those the first year and a half, then I went into literature--creative writing--and I got a degree in creative writing and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>. I remember my parents were upset at my interest in creative writing, because they had struggled as artists, and at that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it was already apparent that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was a good field to be in. So when I transferred to literature and had an interest in writing <a class="thought" href="entries/poetry_entry.html">poetry</a>, they kind of freaked out. </p>
