<p>Originally published in the January 2001 issue of <i>IEEE Spectrum</i>. Published on KurzweilAI.net April 27, 2001.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> will make us healthy and wealthy though not necessarily wise. In a few decades, this emerging manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will let us inexpensively arrange atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in most of the ways permitted by physical law. It will let us make <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s that fit on the head of a pin and fleets of medical <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s smaller than a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> able to eliminate <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, infections, clogged arteries and even old age. People will look back on this era with the same feelings we have toward medieval times -- when <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was primitive and almost everyone lived in poverty and died young.</p>
<p>Besides <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s billions of times more powerful than today's, and new medical capabilities that will heal and cure in cases that are now viewed as utterly hopeless, this new and very precise way of fabricating products will also eliminate the pollution from current manufacturing methods. Molecular manufacturing will make exactly what it is supposed to make, no more and no less, and therefore won't make pollutants.</p>
<p>When <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> pioneer Eric Drexler first dared to publish this vision back in the early 1980s the response was skeptical, at best. It seemed too good to be true, and many scientists pronounced the whole thing impossible. But the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> care little for either our hopes or our fears, and subsequent analysis kept returning the same answer: it will take <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but it is not only possible but almost unavoidable. The <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> around the world has already given us more precise, less expensive manufacturing technologies that can make an unprecedented <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of new products. Nowhere is this more evident than in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power has increased exponentially while the finest feature sizes have steadily shrunk into the deep submicron range. Extrapolating these remarkably regular trends it seems clear where we're headed: <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s with billions upon billions of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es made by the pound. And if we can arrange atoms into <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s, why not a whole range of other molecularly precise products?</p>
<p>It has taken decades for the bulk of the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> community to accept the feasibility of this vision. But when the President of the United States in January 2000 called for a $500 million National <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> Initiative we knew <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> had reached critical mass.</p>
<p>Some people have recently, publicly (and belatedly) realized that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> might create new concerns that we should address. Any powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can be used to do great harm as well as great good. If the vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> sketched earlier is even partly right, we are in for some major changes -- as big as the changes ushered in by the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">industrial revolution</a>, if not bigger. How should we deal with these changes? What policies should we adopt during the development and deployment of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>?</p>
<p>Drexler discussed these issues extensively in his 1986 book <a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a>, and in a remarkably prescient essay first published in 1988 outlined some of the major issues and positions that have since come to the fore. One response, proposed by <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, cofounder and Chief Scientist of <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>, would be to "relinquish" <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> to avoid any possible adverse consequences.</p>
<p>This approach suffers from major problems: telling <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers not to <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and companies not to build it when there are vast fortunes to be made, glory to be won, and national strategic interests at stake either won't work, or will push <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> underground where it can't be regulated while depriving anyone who actually obeys the ban of the many benefits <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> offers.</p>
<p>If a ban won't work, how should we best address the concerns that have been raised? The major concerns fall into two classes: deliberate abuse and accidents.</p>
<p>Deliberate abuse, the misuse of a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> by some small group or nation to cause great harm, is best prevented by measures based on a clear understanding of that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> could, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, be used to rapidly identify and block attacks. Distributed surveillance <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could quickly identify arms buildups and offensive weapons deployments; while lighter, stronger and smarter materials controlled by powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s would let us make radically improved versions of existing weapons able to respond to such threats. Replicating manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could rapidly churn out the needed defenses in huge quantities. Such <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are best developed by continuing a vigorous <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development, which provides a clear understanding of both the potential threats and the countermeasures available.</p>
<p>Besides deliberate attacks, the other concern is that a self-replicating molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could replicate unchecked, converting most of the biosphere into copies of itself.</p>
<p>While <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> does propose to use replication (to reduce manufacturing costs to a minimum), it does not propose to copy living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are wonderfully adaptable and can survive in a complex natural environment. Instead, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> proposes to build molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that are similar to small versions of what you might find in today's modern factories. Robotic arms shrunk to submicron size should be able to pick up and assemble molecular parts like their large cousins in factories around the world pick up and assemble nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>s about replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can be led seriously astray by a simple fact: the only replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s most of us are familiar with are <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. We automatically assume that <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be similar when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s people make bear little resemblance to living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are likely to be just as dissimilar.</p>
<p>An illustration of the vast gulf between self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and the kind of replicating robotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that might be made for manufacturing purposes is exponential assembly; currently under investigation at our company, <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> Corporation, in Richardson, Texas. <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> is developing positional assembly <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s at the micron, sub-micron and molecular scale. At the micron scale, using existing <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we are developing simple "pick-and-place" robotic arms that can pick up relatively complex, planar, micron scale parts made with lithographic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>; and assemble those planar parts into simple three dimensional robotic arms that have the ability to pick up specially designed <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> parts. Called exponential assembly, this replicative <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> starts with a single robotic arm on a wafer which then assembles more robotic arms on a facing wafer by picking up parts already laid out in precisely known locations.</p>
<p>While the number of assembled robotic arms can increase exponentially (up to some limit imposed by the manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>), this assembly process requires (among other things) lithographically produced parts as well as externally provided power and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> control signals to coordinate the complex motions of the robotic arms. Cut off from power, control signals and parts, a micron-sized robotic arm would function about as well as one of its larger cousins taken from one of today's automated assembly lines that was dropped into the middle of a forest.</p>
<p>To avoid any possible risk from <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> (and perhaps more ambitious) <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, the Palo Alto based non-profit <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> (motto: preparing for <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>) has written a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of draft guidelines to inform developers and manufacturers of molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s how to develop them safely. The guidelines include such common-<a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> principles as: artificial replicators must not be capable of replication in a natural, uncontrolled environment; they must have an absolute dependence on an artificial fuel source or artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s not found in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>; they must use appropriate error detection codes and <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> to prevent unintended alterations in their blue prints; and the like.</p>
<p>Building on over a decade of discussions of a very wide range of scenarios, the first version of the guidelines were based on a February 1999 workshop in Monterey, Calif. They have since been reviewed at two subsequent Foresight conferences. Because our understanding of this developing <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is and will continue to evolve, the guidelines will evolve with them representing our best understanding of how to ensure the safe development of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a>'s potential to improve the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> condition is staggering: we would be shirking our duty to <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations if we did not responsibly develop it.</p>
