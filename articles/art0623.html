<p>Welcome to the Xplora scheduled chat with <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> about robots 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Karl Sarnow and I am member of the Xplora team, trying 
              to enable teachers of <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> to give fascinating 
              science lessons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a great pleasure and honour to have Ray Kurzweil here in 
              the chat. The topic itself is really fascinating and inspiring. 
              But having one of the early birds of AI applications personally 
              here is nothing more but wonderful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cordially welcome Ray.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>Hi, glad to be here.</p>
<p><b>Karl Sarnow says:</b></p>
<p>We now start with the procedure as discussed in the mail in advance. 
              Ray will start with a short introduction and then the others follow 
              with a short sentence.</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>Yes, here is something I wrote recently that is a brief introduction 
              to my latest book, The <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a> is Near, When Humans Transcend 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a>:</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p><i>So what is the Singularity?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within a quarter century, <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will match 
              the range and subtlety of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> intelligence. It will then soar 
              past it because of the continuing acceleration of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based 
              technologies, as well as the ability of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to instantly share 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Intelligent nanorobots will be deeply integrated 
              in our bodies, our brains, and our environment, overcoming pollution 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a>, providing vastly extended longevity, full-immersion 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> incorporating all of the senses (like &#8220;The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">Matrix</a>&#8221;), "experience beaming&#8221; (like &#8220;Being 
              John Malkovich&#8221;), and vastly enhanced human intelligence. The 
              result will be an intimate merger between the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>-creating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> and the technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process it spawned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i> And that&#8217;s the Singularity?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s just the precursor. Nonbiological intelligence 
              will have <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to its own design and will be able to improve itself 
              in an increasingly rapid redesign cycle. We&#8217;ll get to a point 
              where technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> will be so fast that unenhanced human intelligence 
              will be unable to follow it. That will mark the Singularity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <i>When will that occur?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> the date for the Singularity&#8212;representing a profound 
              and disruptive transformation in human capability&#8212;as 2045. 
              The nonbiological intelligence created in that year will be one 
              billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i> Why is this called the Singularity?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The term &#8220;Singularity&#8221; in my book is comparable to the 
              use of this term by the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> community. Just as we find it hard 
              to see beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_horizon_entry.html">event horizon</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>, we also find it 
              difficult to see beyond the event horizon of the historical Singularity. 
              How can we, with our limited <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> brains, imagine what our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>, with its intelligence multiplied trillions-fold, 
              be capable of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and doing? Nevertheless, just as we can draw 
              conclusions about the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of black holes through our <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual 
              thinking, despite never having actually been inside one, our thinking 
              today is powerful enough to have meaningful insights into the implications 
              of the Singularity. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tried to do in this 
              book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Okay, let&#8217;s break this down. It seems a key part of your 
              thesis is that we will be able to capture the intelligence of our 
              brains in a machine.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <i>So how are we going to achieve that?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can break this down further into <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> requirements. 
              In the book, I show how we need about 10 quadrillion (1016) calculations 
              per second (cps) to provide a <a class="thought" href="entries/functional_equivalence_entry.html">functional equivalent</a> to all the regions 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Some estimates are lower than this by a factor of 
              100. <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">Supercomputer</a>s are already at 100 trillion (1014) cps, and 
              will hit 1016 cps around the end of this decade. Several supercomputers 
              with 1 quadrillion cps are already on the drawing board, with two 
              Japanese efforts targeting already on the drawing board, with two 
              Japanese efforts targeting 10 quadrillion cps around the end of 
              the decade. By 2020, 10 quadrillion cps will be available for around 
              $1,000. Achieving the hardware requirement was controversial when 
              my last book on this topic, The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a>, came 
              out in 1999, but is now pretty much of a mainstream view among informed 
              observers. Now the controversy is focused on the <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i> And how will we recreate the algorithms of human intelligence?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To understand the principles of human intelligence we need to reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er 
              the human brain. Here, progress is far greater than most people 
              realize. The spatial and temporal (<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>) resolution of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning 
              is also progressing at an exponential rate, roughly doubling each 
              year, like most everything else having to do with information. Just 
              recently, scanning tools can see <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> interneuronal connections, 
              and watch them fire in real time. Already, we have mathematical 
              models and simulations of a couple dozen regions of the brain, including 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/cerebellum_entry.html">cerebellum</a>, which comprises more than half the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the 
              brain. <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> is now creating a simulation of about 10,000 cortical 
              neurons, including tens of millions of connections. The first version 
              will simulate the electrical activity, and a future version will 
              also simulate the relevant chemical activity. By the mid 2020s, 
              it&#8217;s conservative to conclude that we will have effective models 
              for all of the brain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i> So at that point we&#8217;ll just copy a human brain into a 
              supercomputer?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would rather put it this way: At that point, we&#8217;ll have 
              a full understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of the human brain. One benefit 
              will be a deep understanding of ourselves, but the key implication 
              is that it will expand the toolkit of techniques we can apply to 
              create artificial intelligence. We will then be able to create nonbiological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that match human intelligence in the ways that humans are 
              now superior, for example, our <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> abilities. These 
              superintelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will be able to do things we are not 
              able to do, such as share knowledge and skills at <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> speeds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 2030, a thousand dollars of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> will be about a thousand 
              times more powerful than a human brain. Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> also that computers 
              will not be organized as discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s as they are today. There 
              will be a web of computing deeply integrated into the environment, 
              our bodies and brains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, that should do it. Sorry it had to be cut into a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of 
              pieces.</p>
<p><b>Karl Sarnow says:</b></p>

<p><b>James Whipple says:</b></p>
<p>i will ask after Donelle's question</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Donelle Batty says:</b></p>
<p>Some of the students wish to know what inspired you to create all 
              of the fantastic things you've created and they also wish to know 
              what troubles you encountered as they wish to be inventors themselves.</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>I've had the idea of being an inventor since I was 5. What is exciting 
              and inspiring about being an inventor is the link between dry formulas 
              on a black board (the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>) and transformations in people's 
              lives. As for challenges, the biggest issue is timing. Most inventors 
              get their inventions to "work" but most of the time the 
              timing is wrong, so it fails in the market place. That's why I got 
              into tracking technology trends over 30 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>One more comment on Donnelle's question: the most gratifying project 
              I've been involved in has been <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a>s for the blind. I 
              introduced the first one 30 years ago, and have been involved ever 
              since. We just introduced a print-to-speech reading machine that 
              fits in your pocket&#8212;it's 10,000 times smaller and lighter than 
              the first one.</p>
<p><b>Donelle Batty says:</b></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Matt Neil says:</b></p>
<p>Ray my question is around how we are going to transfer/copy/replicate 
              those already higher congnitive functions of the mind, such as ESP 
              that may actually lay dormant in the mind, that we do not understand 
              and from observation may look like garbage as they are not normally 
              activated. Are these functions inherent? And if we copy the <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> 
              will these extras services come along with it?</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>WRG Matt's question, we're now embarked on a grand project to "reverse-engineer" 
              the human brain. We're in the early stages but the progress will 
              exponential not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>. So we will ultimately understand in precise 
              terms how the brain performs its functions, including ESP to the 
              extent that it can actually do that. We will routinely have brain-to-brain 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> when we have <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s in our brains that are on the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. We already have simulations of 20 regions of the brain 
              that perform well on tests compared to human function, for example,

<p>Will there be room for the human ego in a post-singularity <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, 
              or will we be led to less and less individuation as our interconnections

              us as we integrate with machines?</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>WRG James' question, I suppose we'll have to reconsider what ego 
              means. It's not always a bad thing if people are driven to perform 
              creative work. Machines can have it both ways&#8212;they can be individuals 
              and they can also <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> to form one larger intelligence. Humans 
              "merge" also in societies but not with the same ease.

              capability.</p>

<p>As for the brain's baggage&#8212;we will ultimately have the "source

<p>With the known vulnerabilities in current O/S software and computer

<p><b>Jan Kapoun says:</b></p>
<p>Hi, Ray. I was interested in Martin Rees&#180; book "Our 
              Final Hour", especially the part about dangers of new technology. 
              Have you read the book? What do you think about it? </p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>WRG Kapound's question:</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>I alluded earlier to the downsides&#8212;the perils&#8212;of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>. 
              I'm familiar with Rees' book. He talks about these perils as well 
              as natural ones, like an asteroid hitting <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. On that last one, 
              this happens infrequently (at least a big one) and I'm confident 
              we'll have the technology to blast it out of the sky before that 
              happens. The more daunting challenges are the downsides of the self-replicating 
              technology we're creating. I mentioned bioterrorists creating a 
              modified biological virus. When we have full <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> manufacturing, 
              there will ultimately be the potential for self-replicating nanotechnology. 
              There are strategies for dealing with these issues. The issue for 
              society is one of priorities. We need to put a higher priority on 
              the defenses&#8212;I gave testimony to the U.S. Congress on a proposal 
              for a $100 billion program to develop new technologies (like <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> 
              interference) to combat new biological viruses. President Bush recently 
              proposed a $7 billion program for this&#8212;it's a start but not 
              enough. We also need to be smart about not disseminating overtly 
              dangerous information. No one proposes putting the design of an 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> bomb on the web, so why put the design of a killer virus there? 
              (end)</p>
<p><b>Jan Kapoun says:</b></p>
<p>Thank you. But is it certain that we will avoid a situation, such 
              as the example in Michael Crichton&#180;s Prey?</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>Now with regard Crichton's prey.</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>He was writing about self-replicating nanotech, although he mixed 
              it up with biological viruses and there are some scientifically 
              unrealistic aspects to his <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> danger of self-replicating 
              nanotech is&#8212;or I should say will be&#8212;real. The existential 
              danger we face now is with biological viruses, we don't yet have 
              full molecular nanotechnology assembly. When we do the basic message 
              for society is the same&#8212;which is to put more stones on the 
              defensive side of the scale by developing explicitly defensive technologies. 
              I describe some stratgies in Singularity is Near. There are also 
              ethical guidelines that need to be followed by responsible practitioners. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a>, founded by nanotechnology pioneer Eric 
              Drexler has articulated a set of these. (end)</p>

<p>With technologies such as the Fritz <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> coming into play do you 
              think that the fragmentation of THE computer (the Internet) is something 
              that is possible and a legitimate concern for the iminent singularity?</p>
<p><b>Ray Kurzweil says:</b></p>
<p>WRG Damon's question&amp;#8212by fragmentation I assume you mean decentralization. 
              This is a very good trend. Decentralized technologies are more stable. 
              We are moving to a "world wide mesh" in which computing 
              and communications will be distributed among billions of &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Device')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Device')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;device&lt;/a&gt;s 
              in a flexible and self-organizing manner. (end)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damon Zucconi says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I think I meant fragmentation more like cut of &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Government')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Government')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; controlled 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Network')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Network')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;WRG Damon's question&amp;#8212do you mean attempts by the Chinese government 
              to control the web? I think these will fail&amp;#8212they may nominally 
              "control" overt &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Expression')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Expression')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt; of a few sensitive political 
              issues, but people will work around them. There is already an enormous 
              explosion of expression on Chinese web sites including a healthy 
              and exploding blogger community. This is a democratizing force. 
              I wrote in the 1980s that the decentralized communication technologies 
              that would emerge would ultimately destroy the Soviet Union, which 
              it did. That 1991 coup against Gorbachev failed not because of Yeltsin 
              standing on a tank but because of the clandestine network of fax 
              machines and early &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Email')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Email')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; using teletype machines. I mentioned this 
              to Gorbachev recently at a lunch I had with him and he heartedly 
              agreed. Of course, anything to put Yeltsin down.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexa Joyce says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Do you think then, by extension of what you say about bio-viruses, 
              in the next few years we'll see teenage bio-&lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Hacker')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Hacker')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt;s the same way 
              we have young hackers on the Internet now?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WRG Alex's concern:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yes, it will ultimately get easier and easier to do this kind of 
              work, so the answer is we need to develop a (very) rapid response 
              system that can combat ANY new biological virus whether natural 
              (like bird flu) or bioengineered. The good news is that the tools 
              to accomplish this are coming into place. RNA interference can turn 
              any gene off&amp;#8212we send pieces of RNA in as a medication, it latches 
              on to the messenger RNA expressing a gene and destroys it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This has been effective for stopping biological viruses. I described 
              a plan in which we would have a rapid response system that could 
              quickly sequence a virus, create an RNAi medication and gear up 
              production, all in a manner of days. We have the tools to do this 
              but we need to put it in place. There are other protective ideas 
              as well.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexa Joyce says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You mean antisense RNA here to block the genes?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexa Joyce says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This concept of an &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Open Source')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Open Source')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; biology community is very intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wel first to clarify in response to Joyce&amp;#8212there are two competing 
              technologies that can block the messenger RNA expressing a gene 
              - antisense technology and RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi works very 
              well, antisense technology has been disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WRG Joyces comment&amp;#8212yes there will be open source biology. 
              Everything of &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Import')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Import')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;import&lt;/a&gt;ance will ultimately be information. Even manufacturing 
              products. In the 2020s we'll be able to manufacture almost anything 
              we need/want with our own table top manufacturing devices&amp;#8212and

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I think it actually does track quite well. Obviously some things 
              are off by a few years&amp;#8212I would have said 1997 for a computer

              issue as to whether or not we can predict the future. The common 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Wisdom')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Wisdom')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; is that we cannot. But there are certain measures of information

              are very predictable. And its not just computer devices, but information 
              technology is deeply influencing everything of value. So we can 
              anticipate many scenarios quite accurately. We might wonder how 
              can this be? Specific projects are indeed not predictable. yet the 
              overall impact is predictable. We see a similar &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Phenomenon')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Phenomenon')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; in thermodynamics&amp;#8212the 
              path of each &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Particle')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Particle')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; in a gas is unpredictable, yet the overall 
              properties of the gas&amp;#8212made of a vast number of chaotic unpredictable

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Neil says to Ray Kurzweil:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Which companies do you think will get the jump those coming from 
              the bio health side or those coming from the tech molecular computing 
              side.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's clearly a role for both. If you look at how biology is 
              done now it is becoming an information technology. It used to be 
              hit and miss&amp;#8212we would just find something that happened to 
              work with no theory of &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Operation')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Operation')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt;, using "drug discovery." 
              Now we're actually &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Learning')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Learning')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt; the precise information processes underlying 
              biological processes like atherosclerosis (the cause of most heart 
              disease) and also gaining the means to reprogram these processes 
              away from disease. Biochemical &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Simulator')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Simulator')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;simulator&lt;/a&gt;s are playing a big role. 
              Drug development is already quite specialized with smaller companies 
              doing the "risk removal" of specific treatments, then 
              doing deals with the larger pharma companies. (end)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karl Sarnow says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I am not sure about this &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Chat Room')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Chat Room')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;chat room&lt;/a&gt;, but I assume it is kicking 
              us out at exactly 15h00 Brussels time. But I would not be happy 
              to finish the session, before saying a big, big, thank you to Ray. 
              It was very inspiring to read your answers and the questions from 
              all of you. You will be able to read an edited version of the chat 
              on Xplora. Thanks a lot again and I hope to see/read you again at 
              Xplora somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Good bye and thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Karl&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Whipple says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexa Joyce says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Actually I think we can carry on if Ray is still happy to take 
              a couple more questions...&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I've got time for one or two more.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karl Sarnow says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I just hear that the tool will probably not kick us out, but nobody 
              will be able to get in. So feel free to continue. I will record 
              until the end of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jan Kapoun says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thanks, Ray! It was a nice &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Experience')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Experience')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; to chat with you.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Whipple says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I'm sure you know about people such as &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('De Garis, Hugo')" onMouseOver="playBrain('De Garis, Hugo')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Hugo de Garis&lt;/a&gt;' pessimistic 
              visions of society's reaction to a technological singularity. How 
              will society react to change it can barely keep track of? How can 
              the transition to be smoothed out?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WRG de Garis, as I said before I am concerned with the downsides. 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Joy, Bill')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Joy, Bill')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Bill Joy&lt;/a&gt;'s pessimistic piece in &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Wired')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Wired')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;WIRED&lt;/a&gt; stemmed from a &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Conversation')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Conversation')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; 
              we had in 1998 and his reading Age of Spiritual Machines. I do think 
              that de Garis particular scenario does not make &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Sense')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Sense')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;sense&lt;/a&gt;. He envisions 
              a war between the "cosmists" (those who have enhanced 
              themselves by merging with nonbiological intelligence) and the "terrists" 
              (those who have not). It's kind of absurd - like a war between those 
              who use &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Cell')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Cell')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt; phones and those who don't, or between the Amish and 
              the armed forces. There are certainly concerns about "strong 
              AI" run amok, but a war between those eschewing technology 
              and those embracing it does not make sense. Such a "war" 
              would be a non starter. (end)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donelle Batty says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I was just wondering about the use of nanobots to acheive &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Immortality')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Immortality')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; 
              becasue I. Wouldn't this create many more problems such as over-populization.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Whipple says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I agree!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Neil says to Ray Kurzweil:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yes and on that how many tablets are you taking a day for longevity&amp;#8212some 
              say its in the hundres!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WRG over population:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That would be a problem if we had radical &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Life Extension')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Life Extension')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;life extension&lt;/a&gt; and NO 
              other changes. But nanotechnology will also enable us to create 
              any physical product we will need from inexpensive raw materials 
              being reorganized by massively parallel computerized processes using 
              table top nanotech fabricators (2020s scenario). We'll be able to 
              meet the needs of any conceivable size biological population. I 
              describe in Singularity is Near a scenario for &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Energy')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Energy')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212by capturing 
              just 3% of 1% of the sunlight that falls on the Earth we can meet 
              the projected energy needs of 2030. We'll be able to do with nanoengineered 
              solar panels and store the energy in highly decentralized nanoengineered 
              fuel cells. (end)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finally, last question, wrg supplements:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I do take a lot of supplements (about 250 pills a day) to "reprogram" 
              my biochemistry. I take a lot of tests (50 or 60 blood levels) every 
              few months to see how I'm doing. And I'm doing fine. I had type 
              II diabetes 22 years ago but for 20 years have had no indication 
              of this. My cholesterol many years ago was 280, but its been 130 
              for a long time. And all my other levels are relatively ideal. And 
              according to biological aging tests, I was biologically 38 when 
              I was chronolically 40. Now that I'm chronologically 57, I come 
              out about 40 biologically. So there may be controversy about the 
              validity of these biological aging tests, but I do a lot of other 
              testing and feel I'm doing well. People may think this is a lot 
              of trouble to go to, but actually I think it's a lot more trouble 
              to get sick. For young people in their 20s and 30s, they only need 
              to stay reasonably healthy and perhaps take a good multivitamin. 
              But for my contemporaries, people in their 50s and 60s, if they 
              really want to be in good shape when we have these dramatic new 
              technologies from biotech and nanotech, then they need to be aggressive 
              to reprogram their biochemistry now.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ray Kurzweil says:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thanks again for chatting&amp;#8212enjoyed it a great deal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was interesting in this chat how the students are thinking about the ramifications of the sigularity and other technologies.  i think in the space--&gt;computing--&gt;internet era students were all about go-go-go and assumed like the rest of society that the next technological wave would fix the problems of the last.  in this chat, the students are still enthusiastic about technology (e.g. online at a science chat at 1AM) but equally aware (worried?) about the impact or effect of these new developments.  it's an interesting development from say a conversation like this circa 1980.  great chat and too see the students thinking better than possibly their parents did.  more proof of evoluion ;&gt;  thx, ken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
