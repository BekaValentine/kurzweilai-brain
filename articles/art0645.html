<div class="TeaserText">J. Presper Eckert reveals the inside story of the invention of ENIAC, the first practical, all-electronic computer, and debunks some myths in this forgotten interview. "It is shocking to have your life work reduced to a tenth of a square inch of silicon," he said. </div>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net February 23, 2006.</i></p>
<p><i>There are two epochs in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>: Before <a class="thought" href="entries/eniac_entry.html">ENIAC</a> and After 
              ENIAC. The first practical, all-<a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> computer was unveiled 
              on February 13, 1946 at the Univ. of Pennsylvania's Moore School 
              of Electronics. While there are controversies over who invented 
              what, there is universal agreement that the ENIAC was the watershed 
              project that showed electronic computing was possible. It was a 
              masterpiece of electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, with unprecedented reliability 
              and speed. And the two men most responsible for its success were 
              J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly.</i></p>
<p><i>I recorded two days of interviews with J. Presper Eckert in 
              1989. He was 70 years old. My father was Pres' best friend from 
              childhood and I&#8217;d spent my childhood playing with his children. 
              I visited him regularly as an adult. On that day, we spoke in his 
              living room in Gladwyne Pennsylvania&#8212;most of it spent sitting 
              on the floor. We stopped talking about computers only to fiddle 
              with his Nova Chord electronic organ that predated ENIAC and we 
              fiddled with stereo speakers. On a second occasion, I recorded a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> at his daughter's home in western Massachusetts.</i></p>
<h3><br>
              Calculating <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s Before ENIAC</h3>
<p>Randall: How did the calculating machines <i>before</i> ENIAC work?</p>
<p>Eckert: Well, a person with a paper and pencil can add two 10-digit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s in about 10 seconds. With a hand <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is 
              down to 4 seconds. The Harvard <a class="thought" href="entries/mark_1_entry.html">Mark 1</a> was the last of the electromechanical 
              computers&#8212;it could add two 10-digit numbers in 0.3 seconds 
              about 30 times faster than paper and pencil. When I was a graduate 
              student, the Moore School of Electronics had two analyzers that 
              were essentially copies of <a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a>'s machine from MIT. </p>
<p>Randall: What could that machine do?</p>
<p>Eckert: It could solve <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> differential equations but only linear 
              equations. It has a long framework divided into sections with a 
              couple dozen shafts buried through it. You could put different gears 
              on the shafts using screwdrivers and hammers and it had "integrators" 
              that gave the product of two shafts coming in on a third shaft coming 
              out. By picking the right gear ratio, you should get the right constants 
              in the equation. We used published tables to pick the gear ratios 
              to get whatever number you wanted. The limit on accuracy of this 
              machine was the slippage of the mechanical wheels on the integrator. 
              That made me say, "Let's build electronic integrators and stick 
              them into this machine instead of those wheel things." We added 
              several dozen motors and amplifiers and <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s using over 400 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s, which as electronic things go, is not trivial. The 
              radio has only five or six tubes, and television sets have up to 
              30. The Nova Chord organ was built prior to this and it has about 
              170 tubes. The Bush Analyzer was still essentially a mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" height="300" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616033628im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/ENIAC_Photo1.jpg" width="400"></p>
<p><i><font size="2">ENIAC, which debuted 60 years ago, had 18,000 
              vacuum tubes.</font></i></p>
<p>That led me to examine if I could find some way to multiply pulse 
              numbers together so I don't need gears&#8212;then I could do the 
              whole thing electrically. There's a theorem in <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> where you 
              can use two integrators to do a multiplication. I talked with John 
              Mauchley about it. Just who put in which part is hard to tell, but 
              the idea of doing the integrations by counters was mine. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>"The first real use was Edward Teller using ENIAC to do 
              calculations for the <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">Hydrogen</a> bomb." </b></p>
<hr>
<p>The ENIAC (<b>E</b>lectrical <b>N</b>umerical <b>I</b>ntegrator 
              <b>A</b>nd <b><a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a></b>alculator) was the first electronic <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computer 
              and could add those two 10 digit numbers in .0002 seconds&#8212;that's 
              50,000 times faster than a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, 20,000 times faster than a calculator 
              and 1500 times faster than the Mark 1. For specialized scientific 
              calculations it was even faster.</p>
<p>Randall: So it's a myth that ENIAC could only add, subtract, multiply 
              and divide....</p>
<p>Eckert: No, that's a calculator. ENIAC could do three-dimensional 
              second-<a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> differential equation. We were calculating trajectory 
              tables for the war effort. In those days the trajectory tables were 
              calculated by hundreds of people operating desk calculators&#8212;people 
              who were called "computers." So the machine that does 
              that work was called a "Computer."<br>
</p>
<h3>Visions of ENIAC</h3>
<p>Randall: So what did they give you? Did they say, "Here's 
              a room? Here are some tools. Here are some guys&#8212;go make it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eckert: Un Huh. Pretty much.</p>
<p>Randall: What did ENIAC's room look like?</p>
<p>Eckert: We built ENIAC in a room that was 30 feet by 50 feet. At 
              the Moore School in West Philadelphia on the first floor.</p>
<p>Randall: There is a story that ENIAC dimmed the lights in Philadelphia 
              when it was in use.</p>
<p>Eckert: That story is total fiction, dreamed up by some journalist. 
              We took power off of the grid. We had voltage regulators to provide 
              150 kilowatts of regulated supply.</p>
<p>Randall: Did the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> guys working on ENIAC salute the machine?</p>
<p>Eckert: Another ENIAC myth. </p>
<p>Randall: You said the largest tube gadget in 1943 was the Nova 
              Chord with 170 tubes... what did ENIAC use?</p>
<p>Eckert: ENIAC had 18,000 vacuum tubes. The tubes were off the shelf; 
              we got whatever the distributor could supply in lots of a thousand. 
              We used 10 tube types, but could have done it with 4 tubes types; 
              we just couldn't get enough of them. We decided that our tube filaments 
              would last a lot longer if we kept them below their proper voltage. 
              Not too high or too low. A lot of the circuits were off the shelf, 
              but I invented a lot of the circuits as well. Registers were a new 
              idea. So were integrator circuits.</p>
<p>The function of the machine was split into eight <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> circuit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s: the accumulator, initiator, master <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer, multiplier, 
              divider/square-<a class="thought" href="entries/root_entry.html">root</a>, gate, buffer, and the function tables. The 
              accumulator was the basic arithmetic unit of the ENIAC. It consisted 
              of twenty registers, each ten digits wide, which performed addition, 
              subtraction, and temporary storage. The accumulator can be compared 
              to the registers in today's <a class="thought" href="entries/central_processing_unit_entry.html">central processing unit</a>s. </p>
<h3>State of the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">Invention</a></h3>
<p>Randall: Are there any of your circuits still in use in today's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s...</p>
<p>Eckert: No, but that's true of any first invention. Edison's original 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> bulb bears no resemblance to a modern bulb. They do the same 
              thing but with totally different components. Same with the computer. 
              <i>What did survive were the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s, not the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. The idea 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/subroutine_entry.html">subroutine</a> was original with ENIAC.</i> Mauchly had this idea 
              based on his <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the inner workings of desk calculators 
              and introduced me to his idea for a subroutine in the machine. On 
              Mark 1, if they wanted to do a calculation over and over, they had 
              to feed the same tape in over and over. We invented ways to run 
              the same subroutine without any mechanical input. The idea of using 
              internal <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> was also original with ENIAC.</p>
<p>Randall: There's a story that some guy was running around with 
              a box of tubes and had to change one every few minutes.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" height="493" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616033628im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/eniac-6.jpg" width="400"></p>
<p>Eckert: Another myth. We had a tubes fail every about every two 
              days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes. We invented 
              a scheme to build the computer on removable chassis&#8212;plug in 
              components&#8212;so when tubes failed we could swap them out in seconds. 
              We carried out a very radical idea in a very conservative fashion.</p>
<p>Randall: You are talking about many simultaneous innovations. How 
              many inventions went into ENIAC?</p>
<p>Eckert: Hard to say, maybe 100. Some are just good engineering 
              or wrinkles on ideas. We made a memory device where bits were stored 
              as sound waves that propagated down a meter-length tube of mercury. 
              You could input about 1000 pulses at one end before they started 
              to come out the other end, where we re-amplified them and sent them 
              back in again. Sound is so much slower than electricity that we 
              could store 1000 pulses as acoustic waves in short-term memory.</p>
<p>Randall: How many people were working on ENIAC?</p>
<p>Eckert: Total count was about 50 people, 12 of us engineers or 
              technical people. Mauchley was teaching part-time, others had part-time 
              jobs. I was on it full-time as Chief Engineer.</p>
<p>Randall: How old were you?</p>
<p>Eckert: We signed the contract on my 24th birthday, May 9, 1943. 
            </p>
<p>Randall: Was ENIAC programmable?</p>
<p>Eckert: Yes and no. We programmed the machine by plugging wires 
              in from place to place. That's not hard- <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a>, it is not <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, 
              it is not memory. It's pluggable programming. And we had <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>es 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> the functions.</p>
<p>Randall: What was the first thing you did with ENIAC?</p>
<p>Eckert: It was designed to calculate trajectory tables, but it 
              came too late to really help with the war effort. The first real 
              use was Edward Teller using ENIAC to do calculations for the Hydrogen 
              bomb.</p>
<p>Randall: What's the zaniest thing you did while developing ENIAC?</p>
<p>Eckert: The <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> cage was pretty funny. We knew mice would eat 
              the insulation off the wires, so we get samples of all the wires 
              that were available and put them in a cage with a bunch of mice 
              to see which insulation they did <i>not</i> like. We only used wire 
              that passed the mouse test. <br>
</p>
<h3>What Background Led to ENIAC?</h3>
<p>Randall: What prepared you for building an electronic computer?</p>
<p>Eckert: Remember, in that era, Philadelphia was Vacuum Tube Valley. 
              Radios and televisions were predominantly made in Philadelphia. 
              I worked on primitive television at Farnsworth back as a teenager 
              and at Penn I had been working on various radar problems trying 
              to measure the time for a pulse to go out and come back. We needed 
              an accuracy of one part to hundred thousandths, which is more accurate 
              than anything we could do at that time. I figured that out with 
              counters. All this is a good lead-in for building an electronic 
              computer. </p>
<p>Randall: Was it you or was it the times?</p>
<p>Eckert: Well, I may have been uniquely prepared. I was very good 
              in math and I was fascinated with all electronics. I was designing 
              electronic gadgets as a kid and I not only did academic math, I 
              studied business math. Maybe I had the right fusion of interests. 
              But every <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> stands on the pedestals built by other people. 
              If I hadn't done it, someone else would have. All that any inventor 
              does is accelerate the process. <i>The main thing was we made a 
              machine that didn't fail the first time.</i> If it had failed, we 
              might have discouraged this line of work for a long time. People 
              usually build prototypes, see their errors and try again. We couldn&#8217;t 
              do that. We had to make it work the first time out.</p>
<p>Randall: You have dozens of <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s for your inventions. What motivates 
              you?</p>
<p>Eckert: I am happiest when I am working on the edge of something. 
              Where there are not many people who have done it. When nobody has 
              done it, it is pretty tough. That gets me excited.</p>
<p>Randall: If you were a young engineer today, what would you be 
              working on?</p>
<p>Eckert: <i>I want to develop three-dimensional processors like 
              a sugar cube instead of wafers.</i> I want to make a computer that 
              is specialized to simulate a wind tunnel. I have an idea for a keyboard 
              that is shaped like a basketball on a joystick&#8212;your hands would 
              be comfortable... I've been <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> a lot about a machine to gang 
              up a few thousand really cheap processors with a commander like 
              "Simon Says&#8230;." They'd all do the same procedure in 
              synchrony. I have a lot of acoustic projects that are still not 
              solved. Maybe I&#8217;d work on a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> that could clear dishes off 
              the table or mow the lawn. The next <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> is all about recognition. 
              Making <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s&#8230;.</p>
<p>Randall: When you were working on ENIAC did you have any inkling 
              these things would be laptop sized and everyone would own one?</p>

              to a tenth of a square inch of silicon. Jules Verne predicted we&#8217;d 
              go to the moon, but he never had any idea we&#8217;d all sit home 
              and watch it on TV. In every <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, there are inventions that 
              go off at a right angle that change the path, there are new ideas 
              that you can&#8217;t see coming.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" height="318" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616033628im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/ENIAC-1.gif" width="337"></p>
<p>Randall: A lot of people have claimed they invented the first computer, 
              what about John Atanasof?</p>
<p>Eckert: In the course of a patent fight, the other side brought 
              up Atanasof and tried to show that he built an electronic computer 
              ahead of us. It's true he had a lab- bench tabletop kind of thing 
              and John went out to look at it and wrote a memo, but we never used 
              any of it. His thing didn&#8217;t really work. He didn&#8217;t have 
              a whole system. That&#8217;s a big thing with an invention; you have 
              to have a whole system that works.</p>
<p>John and I not only built ENIAC. It worked. And it worked for a 
              decade doing what it was designed to do. We went on to build <a class="thought" href="entries/binac_entry.html">BINAC</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/univac_entry.html">UNIVAC</a> and hundreds of other computers. And the company we started 
              is still in <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> after many name changes as Unisys and I am 
              still working for that company. Atanasof may have won a point in 
              court, but he went back to teaching and we went on to build the 
              first real electronic programmable computers, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
              computers. We made a lot of computers and we still are.</p>
<p>Randall: And John von Neumann?</p>
<p>Eckert: He came and looked at our stuff and went back to Princeton 
              and wrote a long document about the principles. He gets a lot of 
              credit but the inventions were ours. Someday I'll write a book on 
              who really invented the computer. It wasn't Atanasof or von Neumann... 
              we did it.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Eckert gives himself too little credit. It may be but 1/10th square inch of silicon now, but it was a big deal then. Anyone who fancies himself an expert on computers would be well served by looking up the history and reading cool interviews, like this one.
<br>
<br>
We have it easy now, with keyboard entry, IDEs, compilers, mice, large memories, etc. If anyone thinks they're a top dog programmer, D/L this simulator and start writing to EDSAC.
