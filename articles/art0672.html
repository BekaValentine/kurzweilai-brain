<div class="TeaserText">Nanofactory-level nanotechnology could make current weapons systems obsolete and make genocide and super-oppression easier. So the economic bounty from nanotechnology should be used to reduce motivations for conflict. For example, if nanotechnology makes a nation's economy grow at 24% per year, in three years, that nation will have twice as much stuff; they would have less incentive to attack an equal-size opponent and try to take their stuff.</div>

<p>This essay looks at some existing trends in <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> capability 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> development, and considers the impact of nanofactory 
              level nanotechnology (NN). A nanofactory<sup>i</sup> is a proposed 
              manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that could be built if molecularly precise 
              manufacturing technology is developed. Current projections indicate 
              that a nanofactory should be able to fabricate its own mass of advanced 
              products&#8212;including duplicate nanofactories&#8212;in just a few 
              hours.</p>
<h3>Assumptions of This Essay</h3>
<p>The development of a nanofactory seems to be between five and fifteen 
              years in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. If there is a secret nanofactory development 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, then nanofactories might be produced at an earlier date. 
              The impact of an introduction of nanofactory capabilities will be 
              considered for the 2011 to 2025 timeframe. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial intelligence</a> 
              with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> or better performance across a broad range of functions 
              could in theory speed development of nanotechnology, but this assumed 
              to come <i>after</i> the nanofactory, because it is assumed that 
              nanofactory level technology likely would be needed to successfully 
              reverse engineer the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>.</p>
<h3>Safe Leads, and Who Will Get It First</h3>
<p>Any non-US developer of a nanofactory will have to either develop 
              systems that overcome the current US lead in conventional and non-conventional 
              capabilities, or develop new tactics that circumvent those capabilities. 
              However, NN could make large amounts of current <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s systems 
              obsolete. For the US, superiority would have to be maintained by 
              pressing ahead with nanotechnology development, because former advantages 
              may be no longer be decisive. Although game-changing shifts in military 
              technology advantage are historically infrequent, the costs and 
              required base of technology for developing NN are widely available 
              in the world. It is not assured that any one country will reach 
              game-changing capabilities first.</p>
<p>Also, nanofactories are not a finish line for technology. Nanofactories 
              could massively accelerate the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development.<sup>ii</sup> 
              Precise designs could be produced and tested in hours. The cost 
              of production will be almost equal to the cost of generating a prototype. 
              Currently the United States spends billions of dollars and takes 
              about five years to create one prototype of a new fighter jet. In 
              the first months of the project, there are multiple detailed fighter 
              jet proposals, which are then reduced to the compromise that is 
              developed. In the age of nanofactories, multiple design teams with 
              superior <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> assistance could generate many more detailed proposals, 
              and all of them could be built for little additional cost and effort 
              and compared in competitive showdowns. This change in the rate of 
              development will enable leapfrogging shifts in capabilities.</p>
<h3>Some Existing and Expected Capabilities by 2025 Even without Nanotechnology 
            </h3>
<p>The following is a summary of existing and expected technology. 
              Many people do not fully understand the power of current technology 
              or the pace of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. Military technology, surveillance, 
              computers, and other technology are already very powerful and becoming 
              more powerful. The capabilities listed in this section, which are 
              projected to exist in the 2011-2025 timeframe, are those that currently 
              are being funded and appear likely to be successful.</p>
<p>Precision-guided munitions provide one of the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant existing 
              capabilities.<sup>iii</sup> Precision munitions lets the military 
              destroy whatever can be identified as an important target. This 
              places importance on airspace domination to allow the munitions 
              to be delivered. Accurate military <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> sensing 
              are needed to identify and locate targets in real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. In World 
              War II, an average of 9,000 bombs were needed to destroy a specific 
              target; now it usually takes only one or two. A month-long mission 
              that used to require 30 sorties with 100 planes can now be accomplished 
              with a cruise missile fired from 1,500 miles away, and the target 
              will be destroyed in three hours.</p>
<p>The United States has a $2 billion UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) 
              annual budget<sup>iv</sup> and possesses a large and increasingly 
              wide variety of UAVs. Some are as small as <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, but they can 
              be as large as supersonic fighters and bombers. Unmanned aerial 
              vehicles will enable their users to conduct more capable and flexible 
              military <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s that do not have the political risk of loss 
              of military personal. The trend towards unmanned military vehicles 
              also is progressing in ground vehicles.</p>
<p>Standard computers should continue to follow <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a><sup>v</sup> 
              for improvement and would be about 1,000 times more powerful than 
              today by 2020. The potential developments can be summarized as a 
              ten times increase in capability in most military systems and a 
              1,000 times increase in computing capability.</p>
<h3>Production Revolution and Product Performance in the Age of Nanotechnology 
            </h3>
<p>One product of a nanofactory is another nanofactory (though security 
              restrictions may limit this capability in deployed versions). This 
              enables exponential manufacturing. The first tiny lab-built <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> 
              can be made to build a system with two integrated devices, which 
              can work in parallel to build four, and in just a few months can 
              build a full-sized nanofactory. Less than a month after that, millions 
              of nanofactories could produce thousands of tons of products (including 
              more nanofactories) per hour.</p>
<p>Products of nanofactories will be high performance: small precise 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are more powerful than large ones--perhaps a million times 
              more powerful, when shrunk to the nanoscale--and precise materials 
              may be a hundred times stronger than today's best.</p>
<p>Nanofactories will be capable of general-purpose manufacturing: 
              because <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s will be made additively from tiny precise building 
              blocks under automated control, simply changing the program (blueprint) 
              will change the product. A wide range of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s and products 
              will be possible, including computers, sensors, motors, and displays.</p>
<p>Automated nanofactories will reduce direct manufacturing costs 
              drastically. <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">Carbon</a>-based feedstocks are inexpensive. Services, 
              design work, and intellectual capital costs would become the main 
              drivers of overall costs and pricing.</p>
<p>Nanofactory level nanotechnology would bring 100 to 1,000,000-fold 
              increases in militarily relevant capabilities. Systems could become 
              both cheaper and more functional, to an extent that would make a 
              game-changing difference. Sufficiently advanced systems could have 
              an overwhelming advantage over less advanced systems; for example, 
              an essentially unlimited manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> combined with fully 
              automated battlefield weapons implies near-certain destruction of 
              all soldier-based forces.</p>
<h3>Surveillance and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">Data Mining</a> from Now into the Age of Nanotechnology 
            </h3>
<p>Nanofactories will make computers millions of times faster and 
              more powerful than traditional computers. What can you get with 
              this capability? ECHELON<sup>vi</sup> is a highly secretive world-wide 
              signals intelligence and analysis <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> run by the UKUSA Community. 
              It is estimated to intercept 3 billion <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s per day. A 
              similar nanotechnology-enhanced system would be able to intercept 
              many more messages and perform more detailed analysis on the messages. 
              Ten times more capability could be obtained for 100,000 times less 
              money. Instead of a single billion-dollar project producing one 
              machine, there could be thousands of $10,000 Echelon workstations 
              and even $100 portable Echelons. Such a powerful state-run surveillance 
              capability could profoundly impact civil rights.</p>
<p>Smart dust<sup>vii</sup> is a hypothetical network of tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> 
              microelectromechanical sensors (<a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a>), robots, or other devices 
              installed with wireless communications, that can detect anything 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> and temperature to vibrations. Work on smart dust is 
              ongoing at the University of California. Nanofactory level nanotechnology 
              would enable smart dust that is orders of magnitude more compact 
              and with vastly improved functionality.<sup>viii</sup> The improved 
              sensing ability of nanotechnology-enabled smart dust and nanotechnology-enabled 
              UAVs will revolutionize the military ability to identify and locate 
              valuable opposing assets in real time. An arms race to make stealthy 
              smart dust, smart dust detectors, and smart dust hunter-killers 
              may be inevitable. One thousand times cheaper smart dust of similar 
              capability would be the expectation from Moore's law. Today, a smart 
              dust device costs about five dollars and has 32,000 bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. 
              In 2025, standard advancement would provide the same device for 
              half a cent. Four hundred million smart dust devices, one for every 
              person in the United States, would cost just $20 million. Each device 
              could record 80 bytes of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> every day for a year.</p>
<p>Nanofactories could increase capabilities by a million times <i>beyond</i> 
              that. The gain could be split between lower cost and higher performance: 
              devices could be a thousand times cheaper and a thousand times more 
              capable. The same $20 million referred to above could buy 400 <i>billion</i> 
              devices. These could be distributed: two on each person in the world, 
              eight for different locations that the person goes to or vehicles 
              in which they travel, and 40 on different <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s or <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s that 
              they possess. The improved devices would have 32 MB of memory and 
              correspondingly more processing power and sensors. They could record 
              video, audio, biosensors, and use better processing to discard redundant 
              information. Information could be pooled to know which objects and 
              people are together at different times. The <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of any object 
              or person could be tracked. Who and what were you with? What were 
              you saying? How were your heart rate and blood pressure? Your mood? 
              Your facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s and gestures? What was the weather? Did 
              you have your dog, your wallet, your car keys, a gun hidden in your 
              clothes? Did you swallow a balloon filled with contraband? Detailed 
              records of 1600 bytes could be recorded every half hour for a year 
              or every six seconds for a day.</p>
<p>Nano-enhanced smart dust also could be weaponized. A person who 
              offended any of the 100 different groups using smart dust to track 
              them could be killed when the smart dust was activated to release 
              a toxin. Even without nano, a future smart dust could have this 
              capability, but the nano-version would be some combination of cheaper, 
              more flexible, and more capable. This could enable those that control 
              the smart dust to eliminate or control exactly whom they want under 
              precise <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s. This could be part of a system of super-oppression.</p>
<h3>Destroying the World in the Age of Nanotechnology: Offense is 
              Stronger</h3>
<p>A 100kg nanofactory-built combat drone could be supersonic<sup>ix</sup> 
              and have the destructive capability of a modern fighter jet. Nanofactories 
              could produce billions of these drones in a few months. Several 
              could be targeted at every person on the opposing side of a military 
              conflict. Genocide will become cheaper and easier. <a class="thought" href="entries/image_processing_entry.html">Image processing</a> 
              and sensors could also allow a more selective targeting.</p>
<p>It appears that offensive military capabilities will improve faster 
              than defensive capabilities, especially since nanofactories would 
              revolutionize <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and the ability to utilize space-based 
              resources.<sup>x</sup> Nanofactory-built launch systems with widespread 
              use of diamond and carbon nanotube material would enable $1-10/kg 
              launch costs by reducing the mass and construction cost of vehicle 
              and systems.<sup>xi</sup> Nanofactories could create space vehicles 
              with ion drives with 739 kWe/kg specific power, 1000 km/s ideal 
              exhaust <a class="thought" href="entries/velocity_entry.html">velocity</a> vehicle and 9.8 m/s2 acceleration. This would be 
              an early capability provided by enhancing current designs with better 
              materials and molecularly precise construction.</p>
<p>The enhanced space systems that nanofactories can create will provide 
              ease of movement in and around the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a>. For military purposes, 
              space vehicles could divert and accelerate asteroids and comets 
              at the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> and other targets.</p>
<p>These vehicles could position themselves near a space rock (1,000,000 
              tons+) for months or years and divert large ones that would have 
              passed near the earth so that they impact the earth. Even dinosaur 
              killer comets could be diverted.<sup>xii</sup> This comet diverting 
              capability would have <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> that are orders of magnitude in the 
              attacker's favor. It could be used as a second strike<sup>xiii</sup> 
              capability for mutually assured world destroying capability.</p>
<p>The defender would need a comet shield<sup>xiv</sup> that works 
              even if there are intelligent forces actively working to make the 
              defense fail. Most plans for comet defense depend on detecting a 
              comet that will hit the earth early enough to nudge it out of the 
              way. Second strike crews deliberately nudging whatever they can 
              onto earth collision courses would makes defense a lot more difficult. 
              Attackers with space rocks have a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Large-scale space bombardment with large objects could be considered 
              a doomsday response. This could actually be stabilizing: if certain 
              powers have doomsday options, their enemies might back off from 
              attempting to wipe them out. This does not address small-scale conflicts 
              that do not trigger a doomsday response. It is unclear whether smaller 
              incoming objects could be deflected or destroyed; objects too small 
              will be destroyed in the high atmosphere, and it may not be possible 
              to accelerate intermediate-sized objects to sufficient speed to 
              evade destruction. If intermediate-scale space bombardment turns 
              out to be a feasible offensive technology, it could deliver energies 
              comparable to thermonuclear warheads.</p>
<p>Nations and alliances either possessing or on a path to develop 
              significant space programs are the United States, China, Europe, 
              Japan, Russia and India. Nanofactories would greatly enhance space 
              capabilities.</p>
<h3>On Deterrence</h3>
<p>The maximum deterrence you can have is the ability to kill all 
              of your enemies and destroy everything they care about. (Enemies 
              who do not care about dying may not be deterred even by this.) Deterrence 
              does not require this ultimate level of harm; deterrence of a rational 
              opponent requires only being able to cause more damage to them than 
              they gain from attacking you. China has relied upon that level of 
              deterrent for the last 30 years. Useful discussions of deterrence 
              levels can be found at various websites.<sup>xv</sup></p>
<p>Being weaker than an opponent that is evil can be a very dangerous 
              position. A surprisingly small advantage can be exploited for genocide. 
              The Hutus, armed with machetes and guns, killed 937,000 Tutsis and 
              moderate Hutus. However, an imbalance of power does not mean that 
              war or genocide is inevitable. Once side or the other will always 
              have an advantage. Motivation is a key determiner of conflict, and 
              as described in the following section, advanced nanotechnology can 
              reduce incentives for war.</p>
<p>Deterrence may not work if one side miscalculates the effectiveness 
              of the deterrence of the other side. If an aggressor underestimates 
              an opponent's defenses or willingness to resist, they could mistakenly 
              start a more costly conflict than intended. More accurate <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              may prevent such miscalculation between rational opponents. However, 
              a strategy of providing misinformation and confusing information 
              could be followed by a weaker power to confuse an opponent who needs 
              good information and a clearer cost benefit calculation before acting.</p>
<h3><a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">Ethics</a>, Shifting Motivations, and Rational Calculations in the 
              Age of Nanotechnology</h3>
<p>The powerful technologies that are being developed could rapidly 
              shift military balances of power. Nations cannot assume that their 
              existing weapons <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>y provides assured security. A lead in 
              current technology, even current <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies, does not guarantee 
              a lead with molecular manufacturing. The future balance of power 
              will be determined by a nation's level of development with advanced 
              nanotechnology, as well as space capabilities and other new technologies 
              that will be augmented by nanofactory technology. Nations without 
              a molecular manufacturing capability will be at the mercy of opponents 
              with the technology.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology can shift the motivations and rational calculation 
              for war. For example, if nanotechnology makes a nation's economy 
              grow at 24% per year, then in three years that nation will have 
              twice as much stuff; they would have less incentive to attack an 
              equal size opponent and try to take their stuff. Attacking an opponent 
              brings in <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s of risk and costs. With such large gains in the 
              near future, rational groups should not want or need to engage in 
              violent conflict for economic gain. Other differences between groups 
              that lead to conflict need to be addressed to prevent violent conflict.</p>
<p>Genocide and super-oppression become technically easier with nanotechnology. 
              Therefore, it is more important than ever for all people to work 
              together toward peaceful resolution of differences and to keep those 
              who would try to initiate atrocities in check. The economic bounty 
              and other benefits<sup>xvi</sup> that nanotechnology could provide 
              should be used by farsighted nations to reduce the motivations for 
              conflict.</p>
