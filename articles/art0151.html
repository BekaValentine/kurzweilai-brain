<p>Subject: Foldover in the accelerating exponential</p>
<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>Following up a thread touched on in your visit: <a class="thought" href="entries/vinge_entry.html">Vernor Vinge</a> noted 
              (and wrote SF stories) in the 1960s that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, by automating the process 
              of innovation, would increasingly accelerate its own development, 
              shortening the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> constant of its own exponential.</p>
<p>If the doubling rate is proportional to the magnitude of the exponential, 
              then the curve undergoes equal multiplicative steps in exponentially 
              decreasing time intervals, and reaches infinite slope in a finite 
              time.</p>
<p>Vinge calls this the "Technological <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>," and notes that 
              it blocks prediction, just as a mathematical singularity prevents 
              extrapolation. There is probably a curve beyond the singularity, 
              but it has a different character.</p>
<p>Here is a recent pointer:</p>

<p>Subject: A kind of Singularity</p>
<p>Hi Vernor,</p>
<p>A tidbit you've probably noticed before:</p>
<p>V = exp(V*t) has a singularity (at t = 1/e, V = e) in dV(t)/dt 
              but not in V(t) itself. Instead, V folds back, making a double valued 
              function that kind of suggests time travel!</p>
<p>You can see the curve most easily by parametrically plotting V 
              against t = log(V)/V with the <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a> V going from about 1 (or 
              less) to 5.</p>
<p>Or take V only up to e to be neat.</p>

<p>Hi Hans --</p>
<p>I hadn't noticed that. Neat and weird: "After a while the world 
              disappeared, but only because it had already become very much nicer"!</p>
<p>Hope things are all going well. (I'm back to teaching after two

<p>So, I reconsidered the V = exp(V*t) formula that suggested a foldback 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> curve, and decided it didn't make a lot of <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, 
              in the way it jumbled time t and the rate V of computing.</p>
<p>More careful formulation makes for a less surprising conclusion.</p>
<p>Making maximal simplifying assumptions, and shifting and scaling 
              all quantities to avoid constants:</p>
<p>Let W be "world <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>", and assume that each additive increment 
              in W results in a multiplicative improvement in <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, 
              and thus in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and speed V. So:</p>
<p>V = exp(W)</p>
<p>In the old days, assume an essentially constant <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of humans 
              worked unassisted at a steady pace to increase W at a steady rate:</p>
<p>dW/dt = 1</p>
<p>So W = t and V = exp(t)</p>
<p>which is a regular <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose instead W is created solely by computers, and increases 
              at a rate proportional to computer speed. Then:</p>
<p>dW/dt = V giving dW/exp(W) = dt</p>
<p>This solves to W = log(-1/t) and V = -1/t</p>
<p>W and V rise very slowly when t&lt;&lt;0, might be mistaken for 
              exponential around t = -1, and have a glorious singularity at t 
              = 0.</p>

<p>Goody! This led to some new insights.</p>
<p>Ray said:</p>
<p><i>One of your assumptions is:</i></p>
<p><i>V = exp(W) (i.e., that computer power grows exponentially with 
              world knowledge).</i></p>
<p><i>I don't think this is a well-founded assumption. Why would additive 
              increments in W result in a multiplicative improvement in V? I agree 
              that V grows with W, but it makes more sense to say that: if we 
              double world knowledge, we double our understanding of how to build 
              a computer, and, therefore, double the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> per 
              unit cost.</i></p>
<p>The assumption that V = exp(W) is surely too optimistic. I was 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in terms of independent innovations. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, one 
              might be an <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>ic discovery (like log N sorting) that lets 
              you get the same result with half the computation. Another might 
              be a computer organization (like RISC) that lets you get twice the 
              computation with the same number of gates. Another might be a <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> 
              advance (like CMOS) that lets you get twice the gates in a given 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. Others might be independent speed-increasing advances, like 
              size-reducing copper interconnects and capacitance-reducing <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a>-on-insulator 
              channels. Each of those increments of knowledge more or less multiplies 
              the effect of all of the others, and computation would grow exponentially 
              in their number.</p>
<p>But, of course, a lot of new knowledge steps on the toes of other 
              knowledge, by making it obsolete, or diluting its effect, so the 
              simple independent model doesn't work in general. Also, simply <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing 
              through an increasing amount of knowledge may take increasing amounts 
              of computation. I played with the V=exp(W) assumption to weaken 
              it, and observed that the singularity remains if you assume processing 
              increases more slowly, for instance V = exp(sqrt(W)) or exp(W^1/4). 
              Only when V = exp(log(W)) (i.e, = W) does the progress curve subside 
              to an exponential.</p>
<p>Actually, the singularity appears somewhere in the I-would-have-expected 
              tame region between and V = W and V = W^2 (!)</p>
<p>Unfortunately the transitional territory between the merely exponential 
              V=W and the singularity-causing V=W^2 is analytically hard to deal 
              with. I assume just before a singularity appears, you get non-computably 
              rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>!</p>
<p><i>Your assumption:</i></p>
<p><i>N = C4^(C5*t) (the number of computing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s is growing at 
              its own exponential rate) is pretty arbitrary. Wouldn't it make 
              more sense to have the number increase as some function of W? In 
              the latter case, the number of computers could simply be factored 
              into the V=f(W) equation (where my V means the total amount of computation 
              in the world, equivalent to your N*V).</i></p>
<p>Suppose computing power per computer simply grows <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly with 
              total world knowledge, but that the number of computers also grows 
              the same way, so that the total amount of computational power in 
              the world grows as the square of knowledge:</p>
<p>V = W*W</p>
<p>also dW/dt = V+1 as before</p>
<p>This solves to W = tan(t) and V = tan(t)^2, which has lots of singularities 
              (I like the one at t = <a class="thought" href="entries/pi_entry.html">pi</a>/2).</p>
<p><i>I also question the application of negative time, and in particular 
              zero time (which provides for the singularity).</i></p>
<p>Oh, that's just a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of labeling the axes, with the origin 
              chosen in that particular place to avoid unsightly constants. You 
              could shift it anywhere, if you replace the t in the formulas by 
              (t-t0). But I like it where it is.</p>
<p>If there is a singularity, it's kind of natural to divide time 
              into BS (the negative times before the singularity) and AS (the 
              strange times afterwards). (I do worry a little that in some of 
              my constant-free formulas, it is easy to find regions where W&lt;0, 
              though they can mostly be shifted away.)</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, that was vastly easier than expected. I was holding the wrong 
              end of the stick last time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Express an exponent a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> above 1 as (n+1)/n</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The equation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dx/dt = x^((n+1)/n) with initial condition x(0) = 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>can be solved in Maple</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dsolve({ diff(x(t),t)=x(t)^((n+1)/n), x(0)=1 } ,x(t));</p>
<p> </p>
<p>to produce the solution</p>
<p> </p>
<p>x(t) = (n/(n-t))^n</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This has a singularity at t=n.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We discussed exponents in the range 1 to 2. 1 resulted in an exponential, 
              I was surprised that merely setting it to 2 produced a singularity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the solution above, exponent 2 happens when n = 1, and gives 
              a singularity at t=1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exponent approaches 1 as n is made large. The singularity recedes 
              farther and farther into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, but never actually goes away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We reach an exponent of 1 (i.e. dx/dt = x) as n approaches <a class="thought" href="entries/infinity_entry.html">infinity</a>. 
              In that limit (n/(n-t))^n does indeed become e^t (the limit is the 
              classic definition of e^t), and the singularity vanishes to infinitely 
              far into the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But for any exponent even slightly greater than 1 there is a singularity, 
              just far away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This supersedes the confusing previous discussion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I tried a functions sub-polynomial (i.e. a smidge) faster than 
              linear</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dx/dt = x*(1+log(x)) -&gt; x(t) = exp(exp(t)-1)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>vastly fast double exponential, but without a singularity</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But merely square the log, or the log factor</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dx/dt = x*(1+log(x)^2) -&gt; x(t) = exp(tan(t))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dx/dt = x*(1+log(x(t)))^2 -&gt; x(t) = exp(t/(1-t))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the singularity is back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generalizing:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dx/dt = x*(1+log(x(t)))^((n+1)/n) gives</p>
<p> </p>
<p>x(t) = exp((n/(n-t))^n-1)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and again we have a singularity that recedes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>10/19/03, Ray Kurzweil replied:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks, Hans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I appended your follow up message so that the thread will be complete.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is what I suspected&#8212;that exponents over 1 would produce 
              a singularity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now the question is what IS the exponent. We can approach this 
              on either theoretical grounds, or from the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, and hopefully the 
              two approaches will corroborate one another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain linear increments to k (knowledge) cause multiplicative 
              improvements in the performance of a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. For example, an 
              increment to knowledge that allows us to reduce <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> feature 
              widths by a fraction, or a pipelining <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> 
              that allows a certain fraction of instructions to be conducted in 
              parallel, result in improving performance by a multiple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HOWEVER, technology performance is not the same as knowledge. The 
              next question is how does an improvement in the performance of computation 
              (and other <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing technologies such as <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>s) affect knowledge. There are many instances in which 
              it requires exponential gains in information processing to achieve 
              linear gains in knowledge. For example, it requires exponential 
              gains in computation to see linearly further ahead in <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> moves. 
              Indeed, with exponential gains in computation, we've seen linear 
              gains in <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> chess ratings. We've also seen linear gains in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> performance (e.g., speech recognition accuracy) 
              from exponential gains in processor speed, memory <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, as well 
              as the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s (of speech samples to train 
              on). There are many examples of inherently exponential problems 
              for which exponential grains in the power of the information processing 
              technology produce linear gains in performance and/or knowledge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in these cases, linear increments to k produce exponential grains 
              in information processing which in turn produce linear gains to 
              k. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My sense is that it is difficult to justify on theoretical grounds 
              having the rate of increase of knowledge be equal to the "size" 
              of knowledge raised to a power greater than 1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, I do think it is feasible to justify separate <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              of growth, some (or one) of which have an exponent of one, and some 
              (or one) of which have a log exponent. The analysis above points 
              to a log exponent. I believe we can justify that the "value" 
              of a typical <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> or of a database does not expand proportional 
              to its size, but to the log of its size. For example, the value 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> to me does not double if the number of users double. 
              Rather, its value to me increases in a logarithmic fashion. The 
              exponent of 1 comes from the number of users themselves. Having 
              twice as many users means it is serving twice as many people. So 
              the overall value of the network = n * log n (n people served times 
              the value of the network to each person = log n). This varies from 
              Metcalfe's formula that the value of a network = n ^ 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having the exponent be 1 + log(x) (or rather 1 + log (k) since 
              we are talking about "knowledge") results in double exponential 
              growth. You described this as "vastly fast," but the speed 
              would depend entirely on the constants, which we've been leaving 
              out here for simplicity sake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What does the data show? Both your graph and mine show double exponential 
              growth. On the other hand, we don't have enough data points to rule 
              out the possibility of an exponent greater than 1, so the data does 
              not definitively settle the issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm going to work on this some more, including trying to determine 
              values for the unstated constants, fitting the available data to 
              these formulas. If the "greater than exponential" performance 
              of the data results from an exponent greater than 1, what is the 
              exponent and when does it blow up to a singularity?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My belief is that we can justify a double exponential. The data 
              shows this, and I believe that a careful consideration of the theoretical 
              basis for the formulas will justify this as well. That, of course, 
              is profound enough. Double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> still results int 
              he conclusion that our technology will be many orders of magnitude 
              more powerful than our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> within a small number 
              of decades. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is hard to explain how we could get infinite knowledge, or infinite 
              information processing, from a finite world. Then again, maybe the 
              world isn't finite. If every <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> in our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> were another 
              universe, and if every particle in those tiny universes were universes, 
              etc., then infinite knowledge and computational capacity could be 
              feasible.</p>

<p>All the existing human-paced curves will surely become obsolete

<p> </p>
<p>RAY: Yes, I understand that, and I use the term "singularity" 
              in this sense, that is a "rupture" in the fabric of human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> caused by the cycle of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> intelligence) 
              having <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to its own <a class="thought" href="entries/source_code_entry.html">source code</a> and improving it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our dialogue on the possibility of a true mathematical singularity 
              is somewhat of a side issue, although an interesting one. However, 
              I am not definining the technological "singularity" as 
              a mathematical singularity, but (like Vinge) using the word as a 
              metaphor for an <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> with an <a class="thought" href="entries/event_horizon_entry.html">event horizon</a> beyond which it is difficult

<p> </p>
<p>I see this eventuality as more of a continuity with biological 
              intelligence. In other words, I see a gradual shift from the dominance 
              of biological intelligence to nonbiological. Our biological intelligence 
              is already greatly enhanced by our tools. We are <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              the human <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and will thereby gain access to our own source 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>. These insights&amp;#8212combined with our traditional mode of 
              AI <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation that is not dependent on emulating the principles 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of the human brain&#8212;will enable us to create strong 
              AI as well as improve our own cognition (using noninvasive, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>-based, 
              widely distributed, <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You point out that any improvement of our own cognition is a very 
              temporary situation since the nonbiological portion of our intelligence 
              will within a brief period of time greatly outstrip the biological 
              portion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I agree with this, but point out further that the nonbiological 
              intelligence we are creating is an <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> of our human <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. 
              I don't consider "human" to imply "biological." 
              Our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> is specifically that species that seeks to improve its 
              own condition and to extend beyond its limitations. Note that the 
              subtitle to my upcoming book "The Singularity is Near" 
              is "When Humans Transcend <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a>."</p>

              exercise."</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>RAY: Yes, that is a major focus of this upcoming book. I believe 
              we will demonstrate strong AI (passing the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>) by 2029, 
              but that does not immediately mean hyper development speeds. Passing 
              the turing test simply means equaling human intelligence. Human 
              intelligence, after all, is not necessarily all that impressive. 
              If you gathered 100 random people from your local shopping mall, 
              you have 100 entities that can presumably pass a Turing test, but 
              they would not be very effective at improving human intelligence 
              even if they did have access to their own source code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I see these trends consolidating in the 2030s and that by the 2040s 
              we will see changes that cannot be followed by unenhanced human 
              intelligence. That is what I regard as the Singularity and I place 
              it in that decade.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>RAY: No, I disagree. If you look at my curve (which corresponds 
              closely to what you have derived) for the 2040s and beyond, you 
              see rates of change that are so fast that they could not possibly 
              be understoood, let alone governed, by unenhanced human biological 
              intelligence. Indeed, this a point (mistakenly) made by some critics&#8212;that 
              these curves cannot survive to the 2030s and 2040s because it would 
              be impossible for humans to make changes that fast. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the take over of continued accelerating technological progress 
              and exponential growth of knowledge by nonbiological intelligence 
              is necessary for this to happen. Conversely, these curves are feasible 
              because, and only because, of the impending dominance by nonbiological 
              intelligence (strong AI). So it is not the case that our current 
              curves become obsolete. Rather, the "singularity" is what 
              enables these curves to continue. </p>

<p>(RootOf means the solution for _Z of erf(_Z)*Pi-2*sqrt(Pi)*t = 
              0, or erf(_Z) = 2*t/sqrt(Pi).</p>
<p>erf has a range between and asymptotic to -1 and 1. Thus the solution 
              has a singularity when 2*t/sqrt(Pi) = 1, i.e at t = sqrt(Pi)/2 )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus this formula does have a near singularity. Not surprising 
              since log(k) &gt; 0 so the original formula has an exponent of k 
              &gt;1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you really meant dk/dt = k + log(k) then, of course the formula 
              is essentially linear (&lt;2k) and the solution is between t = exp(k) 
              and t = exp(2*k) (actual solution is a complicated RootOf)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>What I meant was: dk/dt = k*(1+log(k)) = k + k * log(k). This has 
              the linear portion plus a linear portion accelerated by the log

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>All this 'scientific' discourse is really amusing on a number of levels.  Firstly, the fact that it basically ignores all the great thinkers of consciousness from Heidegger to Merleau-Ponty and, secondly, because it fails to address any of the critiques Lyotard, Foucault and others have made of its supposed legitimacy.
<br>
<br>
It is rather ridiculous that Kurzweil has been accused of having an 'impoverished view of spirituality' when his thinking is so shamelessly theistic and dialectical.  The blatant resurrection of the One (one consciousness, one intelligence saturating all space and time, etc.) is so awfully theistic has no right to claim itself as anything other than some kind-of mystical fiction.  Reading Kurzweil and the other thinkers of Strong AI, one is confronted with extremely Hegelian (another thinker not mentioned anywhere) notions of 'rising' towards Absolute Spirit; notions so backwards and silly it is small wonder the topic hasn't been taken more seriously by the philosophical community at large (Badiou, Zizek, etc.). 
<br>
<br>
In the Kurzweilian narrative humanity is exponentially progressing towards a 'Singularity' (a point beyond which nothing can be reliably conceived).  Isn't this in fact nothing more than a tautology parading as scientific discourse that serves to legitimate such theological ideas as the One?  Scientific, mathematical and/or technological events, like all events, are unpredictable, they don't follow the simple-minded teleology put-forth by Kurzweil, so in a sense, this 'singularity'  could take-place tomorrow.  
<br>
<br>
All of these articles and all of this chatter can essentially be boiled down to the claim that humanity is 'progressing' towards One Super Intelligence ...  Yet, none of it makes an even slight advance towards solving the fundamental problems confronting Strong A.I. (proof of consciousness whatsoever, a definition of the subject, a software or mathematics that would make self-reflexivity possible, etc.)  Furthermore,  these backwards theistic dialectical ideas of progress (to move forward or develop to a higher, 'better', more advanced stage) which have been completely destabilized by philosophical postmodernism are so preposterously assumptive they warrant no well-reasoned criticism (Better??!!  Positing a faster, more complex intelligence, with more information at its disposal does nothing in the way of addressing the consciousness of consciousness as such ' Nor does it explain this whole mystical assumption of better-ness). 
<br>
<br>
I am believer that the technologies being celebrated here have the potential to answer some of the most profound questions imaginable, and am certainly open to the idea that this is the last generation of humans that will be biologically identical to those from 10,000 years ago, but all this backwards religiosity parading as science does nothing to help this goal.  
<br>
<br>
One MUST contend with not only the poltical dimension implicit in the developement of technology, but its narrative dimension and what that narrative legitimates and privelges and for what reason it does this...  None of this is addressed here.  On top of that, as said earlier, all of the REAL attempts at defining subjectivity philosophically (outside of Hofstader ... like Deleuze, for example) are completely ignored here.

The start of your dialogue seems to be a dead end. The problem is that you have not clearly defined W. What is "world knowledge"? The invention of fire may be the biggest advancedment in knowledge ever because it is required for just about anything. The invention that made the first computer possible can be called the greatest invention in computer history, without it, no computational speed at all is possible. The same invention can also be called the lamest invention in computer history, since it gave almost no computing power to the computer it spawned, while a modern computer breakthrough increases computing power by a great many of calculations/second.
<br>
I will argue that knowledge should be defined to be the same as computer speed. When increasing computer speed is all we care about then the only use of knowledge is that it gives us speed. Therefor, I plead you all to define: W=V.</p></td>
