<div class="TeaserText">The union of human and machine is well on its way. Almost every part of the body can already be enhanced or replaced, even some of our brain functions. Subminiature drug delivery systems can now precisely target tumors or individual cells. Within two to three decades, our brains will have been "reverse-engineered": nanobots will give us full-immersion virtual reality and direct brain connection with the Internet. Soon after, we will vastly expand our intellect as we merge our biological brains with non-biological intelligence.</div>
<br>
<br> <p>Published March 15, 2002</p>
<p>We are growing more intimate with our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s started 
              out as large remote <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in air-conditioned rooms tended by 
              white coated technicians. Subsequently they moved onto our desks, 
              then under our arms, and now in our pockets. Soon, we'll routinely 
              put them inside our bodies and brains. Ultimately we will become 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> than <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>. </p>
<p>We already have <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to replace our hips, knees, shoulders, 
              elbows, wrists, jaws, teeth, skin, arteries, veins, heart valves, 
              arms, legs, feet, fingers, and toes. <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s to replace more complex 
              organs (e.g., our hearts) are starting to work. </p>
<p>The age of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s is well under way. We have <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> implants 
              based on "neuromorphic" modeling (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>) for a rapidly growing list 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> regions. A friend of mine who became deaf while an adult 
              can now engage in telephone <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s again because of his cochlear 
              implant, a <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> which <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s directly with his auditory cortex. 
              He plans to replace it with a new model with a thousand levels of 
              frequency discrimination, which will enable him to hear <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> once 
              again. He has had the same melodies playing in his head for the 
              past fifteen years, he laments, and is looking forward to hearing 
              some new tunes. A <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>s now on 
              the drawing board will provide levels of frequency discrimination 
              that go significantly beyond that of "normal" hearing. 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers at MIT and Harvard are developing <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s to 
              replace damaged <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s. There are <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> implants for Parkinson's 
              patients that communicate directly with the ventral posterior <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> 
              and subthalmic <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to reverse the most 
              devastating symptoms of this <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>. An implant for people with 
              cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis communicates with the ventral 
              lateral thalamus and has been effective in controlling tremors. 
              "Rather than treat the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> like soup, adding chemicals that 
              enhance or suppress certain <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a>s," says Rick Trosch, 
              an American physician helping to pioneer these therapies, "we're 
              now treating it like <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry."</p>
<p>A variety of techniques are being developed to provide the <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              bridge between the wet <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> world of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers at Germany's <a class="thought" href="entries/planck_entry.html">Max Planck</a> Institute 
              have developed noninvasive <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can communicate with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s 
              in both directions. They demonstrated their "neuron <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>" 
              by controlling the movements of a living leech from a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>. 
              Similar <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been used to reconnect leech <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s and 
              to coax them to perform simple logical and arithmetic problems. 
              Scientists are now <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ing with a new design called "quantum 
              dots," which uses tiny crystals of <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> material to 
              connect <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s with <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. </p>
<p>These developments provide the promise of reconnecting broken neural 
              pathways for people with <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a> damage and spinal cord injuries. 
              It has long been <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that recreating these pathways would only 
              be feasible for recently injured patients because nerves gradually 
              deteriorate when unused. A recent discovery, however, shows the 
              feasibility of a neuroprosthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for patients with long-standing 
              spinal cord injuries. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers at the University of Utah asked 
              a group of long-term quadriplegic patients to move their limbs in 
              a variety of ways and then observed the response of their brains 
              using magnetic resonance imaging. Although the neural pathways to 
              their limbs had been inactive for many years, the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of their 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> activity when attempting to move their limbs was very close 
              to that observed in non-disabled persons. We will, therefore, be 
              able to place sensors in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> of a paralyzed person (e.g., 
              Christopher Reeve), which will be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med to recognize the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s associated with intended movements, and then stimulate 
              the appropriate sequence of muscle movements. For those patients 
              whose muscles no longer function, there are already designs for 
              "nanoelectromechanical" <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s (NEMS) that can expand 
              and contract to replace damaged muscles and that can be activated 
              by either real or artificial nerves.</p>
<p>Intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are already making their way into our blood 
              stream. There are dozens of projects underway to create blood stream-based 
              "biological <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">microelectromechanical systems</a>" (bioMEMS) 
              to intelligently scout out <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s and deliver medications in 
              very precise ways. For example, a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>er at the University of 
              Illinois at Chicago has created a tiny capsule with pores measuring 
              only 7 nanometers. The pores let insulin out in a controlled manner 
              but prevent antibodies from invading the capsule. These capsules 
              have cured rats with type I Diabetes. Similar <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could precisely 
              deliver <a class="thought" href="entries/dopamine_entry.html">dopamine</a> to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> for Parkinson's patients, provide 
              blood-clotting factors for patients with hemophilia, and deliver 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> drugs directly to tumor sites. A new design provides up to 
              20 substance-containing reservoirs that can release their cargo 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med times and locations in the body.</p>
<p>Kensall Wise, an electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er at the University of Michigan 
              has developed a tiny neural probe that can provide precise monitoring 
              of the electrical activity of patients with neural <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> 
              designs are expected to also deliver drugs to precise locations 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Kazushi Ishiyama at Tohoku University in Japan has 
              developed micromachines that use microscopic sized spinning screws 
              to deliver drugs to small <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> tumors. A particularly innovative 
              micromachine developed by Sandia National Labs has actual microteeth 
              with a jaw that opens and closes to trap <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> cells and then 
              implant them with substances such as <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s or drugs. There 
              are already at least four major scientific conferences on bioMEMS 
              and other approaches to developing micro and nano scale <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              to go into the body and blood stream. </p>
<p>One of the leading proponents of "nanomedicine," and 
              author of a book with the same name is <a class="thought" href="entries/freitas_entry.html">Robert Freitas</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> 
              Scientist at <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> firm <a class="thought" href="entries/zyvex_entry.html">Zyvex</a> Corp. Freitas' ambitious 
              manuscript is a comprehensive road map to rearchitecting our <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              heritage. One of Freitas' designs is to replace (or augment) our 
              red blood cells with artificial "respirocytes," that would 
              enable us to hold our breath for four hours, or to do a top-speed 
              sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath (another formidable 
              challenge for athletic contest drug tests). He envisions micron-size 
              artificial platelets which could achieve hemostatis (bleeding control) 
              up to 1,000 times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> platelets. Freitas describes 
              nanorobotic microbivores that will <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to destroy 
              specific infections hundreds of times faster than <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s, and 
              that will be effective against all <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l, viral and fungal infections 
              with no limitations of drug resistance. </p>
<p><b>The coming merger of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a></b>. The compelling benefits 
              in overcoming profound <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s and disabilities will keep these 
              technologies on a rapid course, but medical applications represent 
              only the early adoption phase. As the technologies become established, 
              there will be no barriers to using them for the expansion of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              potential. Moreover, all of the underlying technologies are accelerating. 
              The power of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> has grown at a double exponential rate 
              for all of the past century, and will continue to do so well into 
              this century through the power of three-dimensional computing. <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>s and the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> are also quickening. 
              Meanwhile, according to my models, the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is shrinking 
              at a rate of 5.6 per <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> dimension per decade, which will make 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> ubiquitous during the 2020s. </p>
<p>By the end of this decade, computing will disappear as a discrete 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that we need to carry with us. We'll routinely have high-resolution 
              images encompassing the entire visual field written directly to 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s from our eyeglasses and contact lenses (DoD is already 
              using <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> along these lines from Microvision, a company based 
              in Bothell, Washington). We'll have very high-speed <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> connection 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> at all times. The <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s for all of this will 
              be embedded in our clothing. These very <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a>s circa 
              2010 will enable us to meet with each other in full immersion, visual-auditory,

              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s). It will be routine to have billions of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s (i.e., 
              nano-scale robots) coursing through the capillaries of our brains,

              application will be to provide full immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> that 
              encompasses all of our senses. When we want to enter a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>

              with the signals that our <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> would receive if we were actually 
              in the virtual environment. </p>
<p>We will have a panoply of virtual environments to choose from, 
              including Earthly worlds that we are familiar with, as well as those 
              with no Earthly counterpart. We will be able to go to these virtual 
              places, and have any kind of interaction with other real (as well 
              as simulated) people, ranging from business negotiations to sensual 
              encounters. In <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, we won't be restricted to a single

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Excellent writing...
<br>
<br>
I suppose a red light began blinking immediately when I started thinking of all of the "implants." Although when you began talking of nanotechnology I felt that you got somewhat back on track. I consider implants and mechanical replacements archaic. Placing an artificial leg on a patient is only somewhat more advanced then giving him a wooden peg.
<br>
<br>
These implants, are they really the answer to all of our problems? They seem like a primitive if not bulky placeholder for the real thing. I think that it is anti-technology to be placing primitive parts into our bodies. Why not replace missing appendages with real appendages? Or the aging heart... the easy solution is a mechanical one, but what if a real one that is native to the body can be placed inside or even re-grown internally? The real technological breakthrough is rebuilding the things that are meant to be there.  
<br>
<br>
I personally believe that nanotechnology is the future. It isn't a matter of replacing old organs with new hardware. Implanting a device to return hearing? A hearing aid directly wired to the brain is just an enhance cone placed in the ear (So Primitive). What about re-growing all of the internal mechanisms of the auditory lobe? 
<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology is the ability to have accuracy greater then the hand and scalpel. Instead of taking medicines that throw our whole homeostasis off balance, we will be able to target specific organs and sections of the body. Why create a bridge between segments of a severed spinal cord? Nanobots will easily reconnect the two parts. 
<br>
<br>
The fine line between biology and electronics is indeed becoming more blurred. I predict that organic mechanisms will eventually be the well-suited design for most of our medical needs. A new breed of scientist working with both biology and electrical engineering will create accurate cures for all ailments.
<br>
<br>
I enjoyed your writing particularly for the thoughts it sparked in my mind. Something that many intellectuals have been interested in is the idea of making a robot "live". What parameters need to be met to consider something alive? I suppose the conundrum is: As we become more and more robotic will we reach a point where we are no longer alive?

We are already made of non alive stuff - atoms - exclusively. "Alive" and "non alive" has no sense in fact.

What really makes you "alive" is a special informational process called - self awareness. You should worry for your self awareness. It's the most precious jewel of this Universe.

Not all the geometry or robotics in the universe will ever supercede the need for individuality; remember this when subscribing to all the ideas and ideals of others.  Yes we are becoming more cyborg; however this will not, I believe necessarily be a bad thing.  I believe that their will be particular behavior in a general universe.  Many believe that we are being sunk into a sea of placid flatness; I do not think this is the path we are going.  We can look forward to an enjoyable future.

<br>
Man has a Soul that will Live Forever. 
<br>
The Point is - where will this Soul Live? 
<br>
The Soul of Man, which is the true being, can spend eternity in a place known as Heaven or a place known as Hell. 
<br>
The key to going to Heaven when we leave this life is knowing Jesus Christ. 
<br>
Jesus Christ is The Door to Heaven. 
<br>
Jesus said,:I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life, no man can come to The Father, GOD but by Me. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p></center>
<br>
I've always considered concepts of heaven and hell and such statements as "you must become as a child" and "It is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven" as metaphors to help you live better happier lives, not deaths.
<br>
<br>
By promising better treatment after death and the pleasure/ displeasure of an invisible god, religions are able to make promises that there is absolutely no way of making good on.
<br>
You can't see, hear or touch God so you only have imagination (and the priesthood) to tell you if 'He's' happy, and I've never yet managed to have a conversation with a dead person to confirm the whole heaven/hell deal either.
<br>
<br>
The whole thing when taken like that is a confidence scam, with no pay out.. which is a damn shame because if you sift the pearls from the pigshit there is some really usefull stuff in religion.
<br>
<br>
in short Get well soon hun</p></td>

<br>
<br>
For anyone who may lay their eyes upon this, I would like to state, that when it comes to talking about truth and philosophy and speaking objectively, it is important to understand that belief is nothing more than a subjective understanding. It is a fact that one can believe in something that in reality can be far from what is "real," thus leading me to tie this in to imara's post. 
<br>
<br>
Religion is a well organized system of belief, it is not know or proven to be truth. To bring religion into a topic such as this might very well be exposing a limited train of thought. To solicit beliefs in "Jesus" and the "Bible" you are no longer participating in this discussion in hopes to build on a theory, but more so trying to impose your beliefs on others.
<br>
<br>
Most intellectuals know that in order to objectively address an issue, you must look at the phenomena from all sides, this includes not basing an argument on an assumption that is "The Bible," or any other unproven belief for that matter. We are all aware that no matter how many people believe it, or how much a person might feel it, the fact is that it might just be a large misunderstanding, and that is something that we must all accept if we are to live humbly amongst one another.
<br>
<br>
If you would like to put in a word to an objective thread, please state your argument in a form of logic, something that can be explained, observed, and tested. If your argument does not hold any solid variables that are of use to the human mind in establishing an understanding over the matter, please do reconsider participating in these types of discussion... for you might end up frustrating those who would like to build on a philosophy or idea, especially those who are sensitive over the topic of religion.
<br>
<br>
May your arguments be as organized and objective as feasibly possible, good day. - GIL

Also the ability to clone a human being is probably complete whereas we don't even understand nanocrystal behaviour, such as the real reason behind "blinking" and how to make them completley biocompatible without destroying their properties, so nanobots are something that we are very unlikely to see in our lifetimes.
<br>
<br>
I think all you people are taken in too easily by what sounds fun and by what 'could happen' to actually think about the likelyhood of these technoligies ever having any influence on our lives. You managed to miss out how advanced these ideas are in comparison to the mainstream technology and then spouted out time scales of only 20 or 30 years. There is no technological revolution occuring at present and realistically there isn't even one on the horizon.
<br>
<br>
In actual fact there is even reasonable evidence to suggest that we haven't even made it to the moon and I hear people talking about nanotechnology that will be able to cure everything! We are evolving slowly, and if any of this ever occurs it will also be slowly, one step at a time!!

DR TOMORROW's PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FUTURE
<br>
by De Kwok
<br>
<br>
For Dr. Tomorrow, the future is now. The Vancouver, B.C. resident has been tracking, informing and thinking about the future for a majority of his time on earth. Born Frank Ogden, he has written numerous books, such as This Is The Last Book You Will Ever Read and Navigating in Cyberspace, pontificating on how human beings will live in the near future. But Dr. Tomorrow believes life is best lived and has dedicated himself to traveling, meeting and talking to people around the world. Dr. Tomorrow never stopped living for the future.
<br>
<br>
In his online digital diary, Dr. Tomorrow presents Ogden's Laws, a series of points on how to exist for maximum life satisfaction ' from the clever ("In times of panic, chaos or rapid change, the bizarre rapidly become acceptable") to the controversial ("The American Constitution is wrong"). Dr. Tomorrow's laws were written 15 years ago and still remain his tenets today. His intelligent assessment of what the future might bring gives us a present day blueprint of how to live our lives.
<br>
<br>
Not deterred by age ' he is in his seventies ' Dr. Tomorrow embraces the advantages of what medicine, computers, and technology will bring. Although I do not always agree with his assertion, he is one of the most interesting visionaries I've met. One thing is for sure: Dr. Tomorrow will always keep his cyborg eyes clearly aimed at the future.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: What would you say Dr Tomorrow's agenda is?
<br>
<br>
Dr Tomorrow: Rather than tell you, let me point out a few examples. Everybody in the world it seems has an agenda. At an early age, from where I know not, I decided I would not follow any conventional path. So far it's working. I have no formal educational qualifications whatsoever. Today, this is my biggest asset. I have always found a way around traditional roadblocks, laws and regulations. Not by avoiding them but by going around, under, through or dissolving them. Example: I read a magazine article about this West Coast hospital doing some early work with psychedelics. It intrigued me.
<br>
<br>
I went to the hospital, asked to see the Medical Director, and told him I liked what I had read about what they are doing with these new, radical and unusual chemicals and, I wanted to work with him. He asked, "Are you an M.D.? Psychiatrist? Male Nurse? Orderly?" I told him, "None of the above." He pointed out this was a hospital and they did need help in what they were doing, but only medically-skilled people could understand what was happening in this new field. I suggested I would work for him for three months for free and then we both could see if he could afford me. I also pointed out that any new field is like a jungle to most white men. There are no signs, no trails, and no manual. They needed an explorer. I could see the "work free" bit hit one of his hot buttons and my arrogance in pointing out the new field theory caused him to think.
<br>
<br>
He was J. Ross MacLean and he owned this, the largest psychiatric hospital in western Canada. He had been around, had lots of routine medical experience and in the year prior to my arrival was following orthodox medical principles. They weren't working. I was "in." Not only in right then, but in three weeks I was on the payroll. A monthly contract [and payscale] was agreed upon. And, fire me, if he wished at the end of each, every and any month. I got permission to use the hospital medical library and read through most of it in the two weeks.
<br>
<br>
Instead of hurdles and problems I see everything and anything as an opportunity. I stayed with the hospital for seven years. I left because a prominent broadcaster that owned 100 percent of 14 radio and television stations heard about me, came to the West Coast to see me and asked what I knew about radio. I told him, "they have two knobs and one vertical stick. One knob turns the radio on and makes noises as you rotate the knob. The other knob moves the stick and the noise changes." "Is that all you know?" That's all I have to know, I'm just listening.
<br>
<br>
"I want to make you president of my flagship stations in Montreal." The stations went from the bottom to the top of the ratings in the city in the first year.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: Can you briefly tell us about Ogden's Laws?
<br>
<br>
DT: [Ogden's Laws] are 40 of my personal axioms pointing out something usually known that is presented in different or unusual ways. I consider them triggers for thinking.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: Can technology be harmful to human beings?
<br>
<br>
DT: Yes. An axe is technology. If used to cut firewood and keep one warm that is usually beneficial. If used to chop someone up that might be considered harmful to humans. The same applies to all technology. An airplane is usually considered beneficial if it carries you from A to B. If it crashes (and you live) you may have a different viewpoint.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: What everyday items do you see becoming obsolete?
<br>
<br>
DT: All. Twenty years ago I said that 90 percent of the technologies one utilized that day would be obsolete in 20 years. Today, things move faster.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: Human beings haven't always been so enamored with technology and advancement. Do you think that we are becoming more trusting of technology?
<br>
<br>
DT: No. It's more seductive. Example: Thirteen years ago I was going blind. My right eye was 20/300. Left eye 20/200. That's white cane country anyway you look at it. I found an opthamologist that was doing some exploratory work in that field and talked my way into being his guinea pig. He did my right eye first and a year later my still deteriorating left eye (years interval minimized potential infection to the optic nerve).
<br>
What he "did" was to remove my natural lens which is in a tiny purse-like object next to the retina and then surgically-insert an intra ocular lens (looks like a pin-head of plastic). The day after the first eye was done my vision was 20/30. Over a couple of years both eyes improved from 20/30 to 20/15.
<br>
<br>
In fact, in 1992, I got back my airplane, helicopter, glider and balloon licenses. You can say I am biased over technology. I am now trying to talk them into doing a retrofit on my left eye. There is ample room in the "purse" to hold two pin-heads. Each lens has two "spider-like legs" that initially hold the lens in place. I want them to tie the "leg" from the second "lens" to the muscle in the corner of my left eye. Then when I wink the second lens will rotate providing a "zoom shot." Wouldn't that be great for the beach?
<br>
<br>
Tablet: Are you pessimistic or optimistic about the future?
<br>
<br>
DT: I am very positive about the future. I believe continually facing new challenges is what prods evolution. With lots of prodding [there is] no telling where we'll go. I am currently involved in the Human Consciousness Project. Just as an electroencephlagram can be put on your head enabling the doctor to "read" your brain, Roger Nelson of Princeton University came up with the idea to do something similar and read the planet's brain with an EGG or ElectronicGaiaGram.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: What do you think is the future of race relations?
<br>
<br>
DT: The world today is a vortex, a sort of MixMaster. When it stops spinning the world will be light-chocolate.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: Is age a factor in how people access technology?
<br>
<br>
DT: Not in accessing the technology; but in their attitude to it. Obviously if you grow up with snakes (like me, I used to sleep with them) you grew up understanding them and feel comfortable with them. Ditto airplanes. After six wartime years living with airplanes, you think everybody's done that. I think computers (and Apple iBooks at that) should be mandatory in all homes for seniors.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: What is your favorite technological advancement and why?
<br>
<br>
DT: Well personally, my cyborg eyes. Outside of that: the Internet. Nothing, nothing has affected so many, so quickly, in such depth over a wide area at such relative minimal cost. It is more important today to be computer-literate than it was to be able to read and write in the industrial age.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: What do you think of genetically-altered foods and should we be afraid of them?
<br>
<br>
DT: I think they are great. Most people have been using spices in the last four years. They've all been radiated since then with no troubles except lasting longer. I'll eat any radiated meal you will pay for. Radiation will prolong fruit, retarding microbial action for extended periods. Gives longer shelf life so mangos can come from Sri Lanka or Haiti.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: Do you think that, with the advancement of monitoring devices, we are losing our privacy?
<br>
<br>
DT: You haven't had any for years. Did you miss the Rodney King clips? There is no privacy. Period. There is no security. Period. Learn to live with it. Sleep with it. If you become "anchored" to anything, that restricts movement.
<br>
<br>
Tablet: In the future, do you think people will live longer or forever? If so, will this be a good or a bad thing?
<br>
<br>
DT: I just had my 82nd birthday. I still lecture (7 countries and 17 cities this year) and fly all the time. Anybody can do it once they accept [that] they can do more than they ever imagined. There are no restrictions today. None. I can see living to 120 (after all there are now 72 body parts you can get off the shelf). More cyborgian parts are coming out every day: hip replacements, knee replacements, heart valves. Once the demand appears, the solution will soon follow. Something like the Viagra story.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Can Cyborgs beat the laws of evolution?
<br>
<br>
I will attempt to draw a relationship between the possible evolution of cyborgs and the bigger picture rules of nature and evolution
<br>
<br>
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells without a master control. This uncontrolled growth is the opposite of life, which has evolved great order to enable it to function. When a systems justs starts to go without control it often signals the end of life for that organism.
<br>
<br>
There are 2 areas that I see with similar dynamics today: 1) The earth in general, with various governments, corporations, idealogies &amp; of course technologies moving very fast. 2) Our "cyborg" relationship with technology &amp; computers.
<br>
<br>
It is important to look at nature, because although we are playing god and recreating ourselves, the basic BIG rules of the game may not have changed. There may need to be some form of control, or global nervous and immune system in place to control the whole gaia organism, or pockets of rapid growth (technoterrorists).
<br>
<br>
Our current system of control, a semi-transparent democracy using free market economies &amp; freedom of trade should be looked at to see if they comply with natural evolved systems or are they completely un-natural. There also needs to be 100% compliance, imagine if your foot deceided it did not want to be controlled by you. Right now, if earth were a organism, it would be moving in many different directions at once, and defacating in its own bed.
<br>
<br>
As I think the Nano people are finding, there are a lot of good nano ideas in nature to emulate with MEMS (ATP motors, ion pumps etc.), there are probably good ideas to emulate from natural systems as well. 
<br>
<br>
So yes, i agree that we must start engineering or choosing how our interaction should be with the machines now. Let biological evolutionists take a crack at it rather than business people,   politicians &amp; engineers. 
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Let us back track a bit...
<br>
<br>
To answer the immediate question:
<br>
"What if nanotechnology and artificial intelligence would reach certain stages of development even much earlier then predicted by Ray Kurzweil? What would be the explanation for that?"
<br>
<br>
Kurzweil is a respected mind, for his exploits and his knowledgeable predictions. He uses the current events to make his educated guesses. Keep in mind however that these are just guesses. Time and time again predictions have been disproved. There is no way to project with accuracy what will happen in the next 10 minutes let alone the next 50 years. 
<br>
<br>
I have confidence that with the advances in technology we will see the science needed, for nanotechnology to be possible, much sooner then expected. 
<br>
<br>
What do we have to fear if this technology becomes available? Look at the awesome power of the nuclear reaction. Used in a peaceful way we have a viable efficient source of energy. Used in a destructive way we have a weapon of mass destruction. Never the less the decision to advance science was made. Many of today's technologies would not exist if the hurdle was not overcome.
<br>
<br>
I question the correlation between cancer and society. This analogy would have worked 1000 years ago when the general populous was uneducated*.  Now we take a much more active role in our government. We understand the problems that once had to be explained to us by our politicians. Humans are no longer like uncontrollable cancerous cells.
<br>
<br>
Humans for the most part have a fundamental understanding of technology. However there are times when this is not true (I.E. Stem Cell Research). When people become entangled in moral dilemmas.

The idea that we are becoming a hybrid of technology and biology and computers are slowly becoming human obviously has implications for the classroom. Do these ideas mean that we will no longer be interfacing with a machine but with a human-like mind?

<br>
One has to wonder, is this necessarily a bad thing?  The ability to "walk a mile in another's shoes" would enable us to finally feel true empathy for our fellow human beings.  Pride, crime, poverty, war and endless other negative words would be a thing of the past.  Ultimately, human beings would know the true meaning of the word morality instead of pretending to give a damn.  
<br>
<br>
I am all for it!  Individuality is a curse, not a blessing.  If we can break down the walls of individualism and share thoughts, feelings etc., our technology, standard of living and other things will improve exponentially.  I, personally, crave knowledge and would like to see this technology in effect before I die.

Nice, but we are mixing a few metaphors here.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps our sense of being individuals is merely that, a "sensation".  If we break down the walls, however, we will not learn what it is like to "be in the other person's shoes", because there would be no _other_ persons.
<br>
<br>
If you could "plug in to someone else's sensory-emotional beam", so to completely "feel" what it feels like to "be them", you would ... BE THEM.  You could NOT be retaining some part of you that "knows you are you, experiencing them", because that is not what they are experiencing.
<br>
<br>
And when you "became them", and they just happened to be a hermit-type that hates "plugging in to someone else", you would never again plug into someone else, right?
<br>
<br>
Toy with the idea of a super-AI "sys-op", and instruct it:  "Let me experience this other person for 1 minute, then snap me back to "me" again."
<br>
<br>
So, you are this other person for a minute.  After you "snap back", what will you remember?  Either you will remember nothing (in which case, there is really no point) or you will (via the sys-op) be installed with some kind of amalgamated "you plus them" memory, that you can access while still knowing "you are really you".  But that is NOT the true memory/person you experienced, it is instead some hybridized thing that may bear no particular insight into that "other person" or yourself.

<br>
<br>
To BE someone else seems to be different than to EXPERIENCE someone else's being.
<br>
<br>
If that giant sys-op plugged you in, you would somehow have to be able to multi-task between your beingness (as the analyzing being) and the person whose life you were experiencing.  
<br>
<br>
I think it could be done, but it would be sort of like using a utility to compare similar MS WORD files, or something.  Thus the only way you could really "experience" what another was experiencing would be to run a sort of analytical comparison between yourself and the other person.  So to experience another person, you might perhaps have to become (or transfer into) yet a third person, an EXPERIENCER PERSON if you will, who could then sample and contrast between two given people, one your former self and the other the person you desired to experience.
<br>
<br>
Gets complicated when you think about it.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>there was a movie made 1995 with the title "strange days" set in the year 1999 during the last days of the old millenium. There is supposed to be a system that can record a segment of someone's life. For instance, if u want to experience the adrenaline rush of doing a robbery but fear getting caught u could by a disc of someone elses experience. This would push you inte the consciousness of that person feeling the adrenaline, the emotions, hearing the sounds etc etc.

<br>
There is one instance where a murderer connects his "experience" to the victim while he is taking her life - so she is him in some fuzzy way. Morbid yes, but interesting nonetheless.

Although the headgear for a complete sensory experience looks a little outmoded, it's still a great movie, because it asks big questions.</p></td>
