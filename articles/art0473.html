<div class="TeaserText">We are on the cusp of profound biological change, poised to transcend our current form and character on a journey to destinations of new imagination. The arrival of safe, reliable germline technology will signal the beginning of human self-design. Progressive self-transformation could change our descendants into something sufficiently different from our present selves to not be human in the sense we use the term now. But the ultimate question of our era is whether the cutting edge of life is destined to shift from its present biological substrate &#8212; the carbon and other organic materials of our flesh &#8212; to that of silicon and its ilk, as proposed by leading artificial-intelligence theorists such as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil.</div>

<p></p>
<p>We know that <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> is not the final word in primate <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, 
              but few have yet grasped that we are on the cusp of profound <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              change, poised to transcend our current form and character on a 
              journey to destinations of new <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>. </p>
<p>At first glance, the very notion that we might become more than 
              "human" seems preposterous. After all, we are still <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly 
              identical in virtually every respect to our <a class="thought" href="entries/cave_entry.html">cave</a>-dwelling ancestors. 
              But this lack of change is deceptive. Never before have we had the 
              power to manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> to alter our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> in meaningful, 
              predictable ways. </p>
<p>Bioethicists and scientists alike worry about the consequences 
              of coming genetic technologies, but few have <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> through the 
              larger implications of the <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> of new developments arriving in 
              reproductive <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. Today in vitro fertilization is responsible 
              for fewer than 1 percent of births in the United States; <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> 
              selection <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s only in the hundreds of cases; cloning and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              genetic modification still lie ahead. But give these emerging technologies 
              a decade and they will be the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> change. 
            </p>
<p>These developments will write a new page in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, 
              allowing us to seize control of our <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Our coming 
              ability to choose our children's genes will have immense social 
              impact and raise difficult ethical dilemmas. <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">Biological</a> enhancement 
              will lead us into unexplored realms, eventually challenging our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> ideas about what it means to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. </p>
<p>Some imagine we will see the perils, come to our senses, and turn 
              away from such possibilities. But when we imagine Prometheus stealing 
              fire from the gods, we are not incredulous or shocked by his act. 
              It is too characteristically <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. To forgo the powerful technologies 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> are bringing would be as out 
              of character for humanity as it would be to use them without concern 
              for the dangers they pose. We will do neither. The question is no 
              longer whether we will manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s, but when, where, and 
              how. </p>
<p>We have already felt the impact of previous advances in reproductive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. Without the broad <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to birth control that we take 
              so for granted, the populations of Italy, Japan, and Germany would 
              not be shrinking; birth rates in the developing world would not 
              be falling. These are major shifts, yet unlike the public response 
              to today's high-tech developments, no impassioned voices protest 
              birth control as an immense and dangerous <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> with our genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Those opposing family planning seem more worried about the 
              immorality of recreational <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> than about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. </p>
<p>In this book, we will examine the emerging reproductive technologies 
              for selecting and altering <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s. These developments, culminating 
              in germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering -- the manipulation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> of egg 
              or sperm (our "germinal" cells) to modify <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> generations 
              -- will have large consequences. Already, procedures that influence 
              the germline are routine in labs working on fruit flies and mice, 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have done early procedures on nonhuman primates. 
              Direct <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="#">germline manipulation</a>s may still be a decade or two 
              away, but <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of choosing specific genes in an <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> are in 
              use today to prevent <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>, and sophisticated <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s for making 
              broader choices are arriving every year, bringing with them a taste 
              of the ethical and social questions that will accompany comprehensive 
              germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. </p>
<p>The arrival of safe, reliable germline <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will signal the 
              beginning of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> self-design. We do not know where this development 
              will ultimately take us, but it will transform the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              process by drawing reproduction into a highly selective social process 
              that is far more rapid and effective at spreading successful genes 
              than traditional sexual competition and mate selection. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> cloning has been a topic of passionate debate recently, but 
              germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> selection have implications that 
              are far more profound. When cloning becomes safe and reliable enough 
              to use in humans -- which is clearly not yet the case -- it will 
              be inherently conservative, if not extremely so. It will bring no 
              new genetic constitutions into being, but will create genetic copies 
              of people who already exist. The idea of a delayed identical twin 
              is strange and unfamiliar, but not earthshattering. Most of us have 
              met identical twins. They are very similar, yet different. </p>
<p>Dismissal of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>'s role in humanity's genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is 
              common even among biologists who use advanced technologies in their 
              work. Perhaps the notion that we will control our <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              seems too audacious. Perhaps the idea that humans might one day 
              differ from us in fundamental ways is too disorienting. Most mass-<a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> doesn't challenge our <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about this either. 
              One of the last major sci-fi movies of the second millennium was 
              The Phantom Menace, George Lucas's 1999 prequel to <a class="thought" href="entries/star_wars_entry.html">Star Wars</a>. Its 
              vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> enhancement was simple: there won't be 
              any. Lucas reveled in special effects and fantastical <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms, 
              but altered us not a jot. Despite reptilian sidekicks with pedestal 
              eyes and hard-bargaining <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>oids that might have escaped from 
              a Raid <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>, the film's humans were no different from us. 
              With the right accent and a coat and tie, the leader of the Galactic 
              Republic might have been the president of France. </p>
<p>Such a vision of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> continuity is reassuring. It lets us imagine 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> in which we feel at home. <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> pods, holographic telephones, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> pistols, and other amazing gadgets are enticing to many of 
              us, but pondering a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when humans no longer exist is another 
              story, one far too alien and unappealing to arouse our dramatic 
              sympathies. We've seen too many apocalyptic images of nuclear, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>, 
              and environmental disaster to think that the path to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a> 
              could be anything but horrific. </p>
<p>Yet the road to our eventual disappearance might be paved not by 
              humanity's failure but by its success. <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a>ive self- transformation 
              could change our descendants into something sufficiently different 
              from our present selves to not be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> we use the 
              term now. Such an occurrence would more aptly be termed a pseudoextinction, 
              since it would not end our lineage. Unlike the saber-toothed tiger 
              and other large <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s that left no descendants when our ancestors 
              drove them to <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> would spawn its own successors 
              by fast-forwarding its <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. </p>
<p>Some disaster, of course, might derail our technological advance, 
              or our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> might prove too complex to rework. But our recent 
              deciphering of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> (the entirety of our genetic constitution) 
              and our massive push to unravel <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>'s workings suggest that modification 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> is far nearer to <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> than the distant <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> travel 
              we see in <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> movies. Moreover, we are unlikely to achieve 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to flit around the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a> without being able to breach 
              our own <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> as well. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a> is only a beginning. 
            </p>
<p>Considering the barrage of press reports about the project, we 
              naturally wonder how much is hype. Extravagant metaphor has not 
              been lacking. We are deciphering the "code of codes," 
              reading the book of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>," looking at the "holy grail 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>." It is reminiscent of the enthusiasm that 
              attended Neil Armstrong's 1969 walk on the moon. Humanity seemed 
              poised to march toward the stars, but 2001 has come and gone, and 
              there has been no <a class="thought" href="entries/sentient_entry.html">sentient</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/hal_entry.html">HAL</a>, no odyssey to the 
              moons of Jupiter. Thirty years from now, however, I do not think 
              we will look back at the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">Human Genome Project</a> with a similar wistful 
              disappointment. Unlike outer <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> is at our core, and 
              as we learn to manipulate it, we are <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to manipulate ourselves. 
            </p>
<p>Well before this new millennium's close, we will almost certainly 
              change ourselves enough to become much more than simply <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. In 
              this book, I will explore the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> and meaning of these coming 
              changes, place them within the larger <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of our rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and examine the social and ethical implications 
              of the first tentative steps we are now taking. </p>
<p>Many bioethicists do not share my perspective on where we are heading. 
              They imagine that our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> might become potent enough to alter 
              us, but that we will turn away from it and reject <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> enhancement. 
              But the reshaping of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> does not hinge on 
              some cadre of demonic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers hidden away in a lab in Argentina 
              trying to pick up where Hitler left off. The coming possibilities 
              will be the inadvertent spinoff of mainstream <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> that virtually 
              everyone supports. Infertility, for example, is a source of deep 
              pain for millions of couples. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers and clinicians working 
              on in vitro fertilization (IVF) don't think much about <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but nonetheless are building a foundation of expertise 
              in conceiving, handling, testing, and implanting <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s,

<a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. Already, we are seeing attempts to apply this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              in highly controversial ways: as premature as today's efforts to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/clone_entry.html">clone</a> humans may be, they would be the flimsiest of fantasies if 
              they could not draw on decades of work on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> IVF. </p>
<p>Similarly, in early 2001 more than five hundred gene-therapy trials 
              were under way or in review throughout the world. The <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers 
              are trying to cure real people suffering from real <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s and

              IVF <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers. But their <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> toward inserting genes into 
              adult cells will be one more piece of the foundation for manipulating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s. </p>
<p>Not everything that can be done should or will be done, of course, 
              but once a relatively inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> becomes feasible in 
              thousands of laboratories around the world and a sizable fraction 
              of the population sees it as beneficial, it will be used. </p>
<p>Erewhon, the brilliant 1872 satire by Samuel Butler, contains a 
              scene that suggests what would be needed to stop the coming reworking 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. Erewhon is a civilized land with archaic <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              the result of a civil war won by the "anti-machinists" 
              five centuries before the book's story takes place. After its victory, 
              this faction outlawed all further mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and destroyed 
              all improvements made in the previous three centuries. They felt 
              that to do otherwise would be suicide. "Reflect upon the extraordinary 
              advance which <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have made during the last few hundred years," 
              wrote their ancient leader, "and note how slowly the <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> 
              and vegetable kingdoms are advancing . . . I fear none of the existing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s; what I fear is the extraordinary rapidity at which they 
              are becoming something very different to what they are at present 
              . . . Though our rebellion against their infant power will cause 
              infinite suffering . . . we must [otherwise see] ourselves gradually 
              superseded by our own creatures until we rank no higher in comparison 
              with them, than the beasts of the field with ourselves." </p>
<p>Butler would no doubt have chuckled at his own prescience had he 
              been able to watch the special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> defeat

<p>One irony of humanity's growing power to shape its own <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              is the <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> of the architects. In 1998, I spoke at a conference 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian cloning in Washington, D.<a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>., and met Ian Wilmut, the 
              Scottish scientist whose cloning of Dolly had created such a furor 
              the previous year. Affronted by my relative lack of concern about 
              the eventual cloning of humans, he vehemently insisted that the 
              idea was abhorrent and that I was irresponsible to say that it would 
              likely occur within a decade. His anger surprised me, considering 
              that I was only speaking about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> cloning, whereas he had played 
              a role in the breakthrough that might bring it about. Incidentally, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> attorneys at the Roslin Institute, where the work occurred, 
              and PPL Therapeutics, which funded the work, did not overlook the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> applications, since claims on their <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> specifically 
              cover them. </p>
<p>We cannot hold ourselves apart from the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> heritage that 
              has shaped us. What we learn from fruit flies, mice, or even a cute 
              Dorset ewe named Dolly is relevant to us. No <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how much the

              we will soon have over our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. Our desire to apply the results

              much of the funding of this work. </p>
<p>Over the past hundred years, the trajectory of the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s 
              traces a clear shift from description to understanding to manipulation. 
              At the close of the nineteenth century, describing new <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s or <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> was still a good Ph.D. project for a student. 
              This changed during the twentieth century, and such observations 
              became largely a means for understanding the workings of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. 
              That too is now changing, and in the first half of the twenty-first 
              century, <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> understanding will likely become less an end 
              in itself than a means to manipulate <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. In one century, we 
              have moved from observing to understanding to <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering. Early 
              Tinkering The best gauge of how far we will go in manipulating our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> and that of our children is not what we say to pollsters, 
              but what we are doing in those areas in which we already can modify 
              our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. On August 2, 1998, Marco Pantani cycled along the Champs 
              &#201;lys&#233;es to win the eighty-fifth Tour de France, but 
              the race's real story was the scandal over performance enhancement 
              -- which, of course, means drugs. </p>
<p>The banned hormone erythropoietin was at the heart of this particular 
              chapter in the ongoing saga of athletic performance enhancement. 
              By raising the <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>-carrying <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of red blood cells, the 
              drug can boost endurance by 10 to 15 percent. Early in the race, 
              a stash of it was found in the car of the masseur of the Italian 
              team Festina -- one of the world's best -- and after an investigation 
              the entire team was booted from the race. A few days later, more 
              erythropoietin was found, this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in the possession of one of 
              the handlers of the Dutch team, and several of its cyclists were 
              kicked out. As police raids intensified, five Spanish teams and 
              an Italian one quit in protest, leaving only fourteen of the original 
              twenty-one teams. </p>
<p>The public had little sympathy for the cheaters, but a crowd of 
              angry Festina supporters protested that their riders had been unfairly 
              singled out, and the French minister of health insisted that doping 
              had been going on since racing began. Two years later in a courtroom 
              in Lille, the French sports icon Richard Virenque, five- <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> winner 
              of the King of the Mountains jersey in the Tour de France, seemed 
              to confirm as much when the president of the court asked him if 
              he took doping products. "We don't say doping," replied 
              Virenque. "We say we're 'preparing for the race.'" </p>
<p>The most obvious problem with today's performance-enhancing drugs 
              -- besides their being a way of cheating -- is that they're dangerous. 
              And when one athlete uses them, others must follow suit to stay 
              competitive. But more than safety is at issue. The concern is what 
              sports will be like when competitors need medical pit crews. As 
              difficult as the problem of doping is, it will soon worsen, because 
              such drugs will become safer, more effective, and harder to detect. 
            </p>
<p>Professional sports offers a preview of the spread of enhancement 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> into other arenas. Sports may carry stronger incentives 
              to cheat, and thus push athletes toward greater health risks, but 
              the nonsporting world is not so different. A person working two 
              jobs feels under pressure to produce, and so does a student taking 
              a test or someone suffering the effects of growing old. When safe, 
              reliable metabolic and physiological enhancers exist, the public 
              will want them, even if they are illegal. To block their use will 
              be far more daunting than today's war on drugs. An antidrug <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> 
              proclaiming "Dope is for dopes!" or one showing a frying 
              egg with the caption "Your <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> on drugs" would not persuade 
              anyone to stop using a safe <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> enhancer. </p>
<p>Aesthetic surgery is another budding field for enhancement. When 
              we try to improve our appearance, the personal stakes are high because 
              our looks are always with us. Knowing that the photographs of beautiful 
              models in magazines are airbrushed does not make us any less self-conscious 
              if we believe we have a smile too gummy, skin too droopy, breasts 
              too small, a nose too big, a head too bald, or any other such "defects." 
              Surgery to correct these nonmedical problems has been growing rapidly 
              and spreading to an ever-younger <a class="thought" href="entries/client_entry.html">client</a>ele. Public approval of aesthetic 
              surgery has climbed some 50 percent in the past decade in the United 
              States. We may not be modifying our genes yet, but we are ever more 
              willing to resort to surgery to hold back the most obvious (and 
              superficial) manifestations of aging, or even simply to remodel 
              our bodies. Nor is this only for the <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a>y. In 1994, when the 
              median income in the United States was around $38,000, two thirds 
              of the 400,000 aesthetic surgeries were performed on those with 
              a family income under $50,000, and health insurance rarely covered 
              the procedures. Older women who have subjected themselves to numerous 
              face-lifts but can no longer stave off the signs of aging are not 
              a rarity. But the tragedy is not so much that these women fight 
              so hard to deny the years of visible decline, but that their struggle 
              against <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>'s natural ebb ultimately must fail. If such a decline 
              were not inevitable, many people would eagerly embrace <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> 
              or genetic interventions to retard aging. </p>
<p>The desire to triumph over our own <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> is an ancient <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>, 
              but it hardly stands alone. Whether we look at today's manipulations 
              of our bodies by face-lifts, tattoos, pierced ears, or erythropoietin, 
              the same message rings loud and clear: if <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a> one day enables 
              us to manipulate our <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> in appealing ways, many of us will 
              do so -- even if the benefits are dubious and the risks not insignificant. 
              To most people, the earliest adopters of these technologies will 
              seem reckless or crazy, but are they so different from the daredevil 
              test pilots of jet aircraft in the 1950s? Virtually by definition, 
              early users believe that the possible gains from their bravado justify 
              the risks. Otherwise, they would wait for flawed procedures to be 
              discarded, for technical glitches to be worked through, for interventions 
              to become safer and more predictable. </p>
<p>In truth, as long as people compete with one another for money, 
              status, and mates, as long as they look for ways to display their 
              worth and uniqueness, they will look for an edge for themselves 
              and their children. </p>
<p>People will make mistakes with these <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> manipulations. 
              People will abuse them. People will worry about them. But as much 
              could be said about any potent new development. No <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>al 
              body will <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> some legislative wand and make advanced genetic and 
              reproductive technologies go away, and we would be foolish to want 
              this. Our collective challenge is not to figure out how to block 
              these developments, but how best to realize their benefits while 
              minimizing our risks and safeguarding our rights and <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>s. This 
              will not be easy. </p>
<p>Our <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is not a tale of self-restraint. Ten thousand years 
              ago, when humans first crossed the Bering Strait to enter the Americas, 
              they found huge herds of mammoths and other large <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s. In short 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, these Clovis peoples, named for the archaeological site in 
              New Mexico where their tools were first identified, used their skill 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>ry to drive them to <a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">extinction</a>. This was no aberration: 
              the arrival of humans in Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar, Hawaii, 
              and Easter Island brought the same slaughter of wildlife. We may 
              like to believe that primitive peoples lived in balance with <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, 
              but when they entered new lands, they reshaped them in profound, 
              often destructive ways. Jared Diamond, a professor of <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a> 
              at the UCLA School of <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">Medicine</a> and an expert on how geography and 
              environment have affected <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, has tried to reconcile 
              this typical <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> with the rare <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>s in which destruction 
              did not occur. He writes that while "small, long- established 
              egalitarian societies can evolve conservationist practices, because 
              they've had plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to get to know their local environment 
              and to perceive their own self-interest," these practices do 
              not occur when a people suddenly colonizes an unfamiliar environment 
              or acquires a potent new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. </p>
<p>Our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is evolving so rapidly that by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we begin 
              to adjust to one development, another is already surpassing it. 
              The answer would seem to be to slow down and devise the best course 
              in advance, but that notion is a mirage. Change is accelerating, 
              not slowing, and even if we could agree on what to aim for, the 
              goal would probably be unrealistic. Complex changes are occurring 
              across too broad a front to chart a path. The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> is too opaque 
              to foresee the eventual impacts of <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant new technologies, much 
              less whole bodies of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> like <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> (the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s). 
              No one understood the powerful effects of the automobile or television 
              at its inception. Few appreciated that our use of <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s would 
              lead to widespread drug resistance or that improved nutrition and 
              public health in the developing world would help bring on a population 
              explosion. Our blindness about the consequences of new reproductive 
              technologies is nothing new, and we will not be able to erase the 
              uncertainty by convening an august panel to think through the issues. 
            </p>
<p>No shortcut is possible. As always, we will have to earn our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              by using the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> from the problems that arise. 
              Given that some people will dabble in the new procedures as soon 
              as they become even remotely <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible, our safest path is to not 
              drive early explorations underground. What we learn about such <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              while it is imperfect and likely to be used by only a small <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of people may help us figure out how to manage it more wisely as 
              it matures. Genes and Dreams James Watson, codiscoverer of the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, cowinner of the Nobel Prize, and first director of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">Genome</a> Project, is arguably the most famous biologist of our times. 
              The double-helical <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> that he and <a class="thought" href="entries/crick_entry.html">Francis Crick</a> described 
              in 1953 has become the universally recognized <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a> of a scientific 
              dawn whose brightness we have barely begun to glimpse. In 1998, 
              I was the moderator of a panel on which he sat with a half-dozen 
              other leading molecular biologists, including Leroy Hood, the scientist 
              who developed the first automated <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> sequencer, and French Anderson, 
              the father of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> gene therapy. The topic was <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, 
              and the audience <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>ed about a thousand, mostly nonscientists. 
              Anderson intoned about the moral distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> therapy 
              and enhancement and laid out a laundry list of <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s that 
              would have to be met before germline interventions would be acceptable. 
              The seventy-year-old Watson sat quietly, his thinly tufted head 
              lolled back as though he were asleep on a bus, but he was wide awake, 
              and later shot an oblique dig, complaining about "fundamentalists 
              from Tulsa, Oklahoma," which just happens to be where Anderson 
              grew up. Watson summed up his own view with inimitable bluntness: 
              "No one really has the guts to say it, but if we could make 
              better <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn't we?" 
            </p>
<p>Anderson, a wiry two-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> national karate champion in the over-sixty 
              category, is unused to being attacked as a conservative. Too often 
              he has been the point man for gene therapy, receiving <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> threats 
              for his pioneering efforts in the early 1990s and for a more recent 
              attempt to win approval for fetal gene therapy. But the landscape 
              has shifted. When organizing this symposium, a colleague and I worried 
              about disruptive demonstrators, and could find only an occasional 
              article outside academia on <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> germline therapy. A year later, 
              stories about "designer children" were getting major play 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> and Newsweek, and today I frequently receive e-mail from 
              high school students doing term papers on the subject. </p>
<p>Watson's simple question, "If we could make better humans 
              . . . why shouldn't we?" cuts to the heart of the controversy 
              about <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic enhancement. Worries about the procedure's feasibility 
              or safety miss the point. No serious scientists advocate manipulating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> until such interventions are safe and reliable. </p>
<p>Why all the fuss, then? Opinions may differ about what risks are 
              acceptable, but virtually every physician agrees that any procedure 
              needs to be safe, and that any potential benefit needs to be weighed 
              against the risks. Moreover, few prospective parents would seek 
              even a moderately risky genetic enhancement for their child unless 
              it was extremely beneficial, relatively safe, and unobtainable in 
              an easier way. Actually, some critics, like Leon Kass, a well-known 
              bioethicist at the University of Chicago who has long opposed such 
              potential interventions, aren't worried that this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will 
              fail, but that it will succeed, and succeed gloriously. </p>
<p>Their nightmare is that safe, reliable genetic manipulations will 
              allow people to substantively enhance their <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. They believe 
              that the use -- and misuse -- of this power will tear the fabric 
              of our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>. Such angst is particularly prevalent in western 
              Europe, where most <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s take a more conservative stand on 
              the use of genetic technologies, even banning genetically altered 
              foods. Stefan Winter, a physician at the University of Bonn and 
              former vice president of the European Committee for Biomedical <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">Ethics</a>, 
              says, "We should never apply germline gene interventions to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. The breeding of mankind would be a social nightmare 
              from which no one could escape." </p>
<p>Given Hitler's appalling foray into racial purification, European 
              sensitivities are understandable, but they miss the bigger picture. 
              The possibility of altering the genes of our prospective children 
              is not some isolated spinoff of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> but an integral 
              part of the advancing technologies that culminate a century of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s. We have spent billions to unravel our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, not out of idle curiosity, but in the hope of bettering 
              our lives. We are not about to turn away from this. </p>
<p>The coming advances will challenge our fundamental notions about 
              the rhythms and meaning of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Today, the "natural" 
              setting for the vast majority of humans, especially in the economically 
              developed world, bears no resemblance to the stomping grounds of 
              our primitive ancestors, and nothing suggests that we will be any 
              more hesitant about "improving" our own <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> than we 
              were about "improving" our environment. The technological 
              powers we have hitherto used so effectively to remake our world 
              are now potent and precise enough for us to turn them on ourselves. 
              Breakthroughs in the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>like arrays called <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> chips, which may 
              soon read thirty thousand genes at a pop; in artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>s, 
              which now divide as stably as their naturally occurring cousins; 
              and in bio-informatics, the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-driven <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ologies 
              to decipher our <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s -- all are paving the way to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering and the beginnings of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> design. </p>
<p>The birth of Dolly caused a stir not because of any real possibility 
              of swarms of replicated humans, but because of what it signified. 
              Anyone could see that one of the most intimate aspects of our lives 
              -- the passing of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> from one generation to the next -- might 
              one day change beyond recognition. Suddenly the idea that we could 
              hold ourselves apart and remain who we are and as we are while transforming 
              the world around us seemed untenable. </p>
<p>Difficult ethical issues about our use of genetic and reproductive 
              technologies have already begun to emerge. It is illegal in much 
              of the world to test fetal gender for the purpose of <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> selection, 
              but the practice is commonplace. A study in Bombay reported that 
              an astounding 7,997 out of 8,000 aborted fetuses were <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a>, and 
              in South Korea such abortions have become so widespread that some 
              65 percent of thirdborn children are boys, presumably because couples 
              are unwilling to have yet a third girl. Nor is there any consensus 
              among physicians about <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> selection. In a recent poll, only 32 
              percent of doctors in the United States <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> the practice should 
              be illegal. Support for a ban ranged from 100 percent in Portugal 
              to 22 percent in China. Although we may be uncomfortable with the 
              idea of a woman aborting her fetus because of its gender, a culture 
              that allows abortion at a woman's sole discretion would require 
              a major contortion to ban this <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> selection. </p>
<p>Clearly, these technologies will be virtually impossible to control. 
              As long as abortion and prenatal tests are available, parents who 
              feel strongly about the <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> of their child will use these tools. 
              Such practices are nothing new. In nineteenth-century India, the 
              British tried to stop <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> infanticide among high-caste Indians 
              and failed. Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, at least in India, may merely have 
              substituted abortion for infanticide. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">Sex</a> selection highlights an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant problem that greater control 
              over <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> reproduction could bring. Some practices that seem unthreatening 
              when used by any particular <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> could become very challenging 
              if they became widespread. If almost all couples had boys, the shortage 
              of girls would obviously be disastrous, but extreme scenarios of 
              this sort are highly suspect because they ignore corrective forces 
              that usually come into play. </p>
<p>Worry over potential <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> imbalances is but one example of a general 
              unease about <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> selection. Our choices about other aspects of 
              our children's <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> might create social imbalances too -- for 
              example, large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of children who conform to the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>'s ideals 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>. Such concerns multiply when we couple them with visions 
              of a "slippery slope," whereby initial use, even if relatively 
              innocuous, inevitably leads to ever more widespread and problematic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> applications: as marijuana leads to cocaine, and social drinking 
              to alcoholism, gender selection will lead to clusters of genetically 
              enhanced superhumans who will dominate if not enslave us. If we 
              accept such <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing, the only way to avoid ultimate disaster is 
              to avoid the route at the outset, and we clearly haven't. </p>
<p>The argument that we should ban cloning and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> germline therapy 
              because they would reduce genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> is a good example of 
              the misuse of extrapolations of this sort. Even the birth of a whopping 
              one million genetically altered children a year -- more than ten 
              times the total <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of IVF births during the decade following 
              the first such procedure in 1978 -- would still be less than 1/100 
              of the babies born worldwide each year. The <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>'s impact 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> will be immense in many ways, but a consequential diminution 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> is not worth worrying about. </p>
<p>To noticeably narrow the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> gene pool in the decades ahead, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> would have to be applied in a consistent fashion 
              and used a hundred times more frequently than even the strongest 
              enthusiasts hope for. Such widespread use could never occur unless 
              great <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of people embraced the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s forced 
              them to submit to it. The former could happen only if people came 
              to view the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> as extraordinarily safe, reliable, and desirable; 
              the latter only if our democratic institutions had already suffered 
              assaults so grave that the loss of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> would be the 
              least of our problems. While there are many valid philosophical, 
              social, ethical, scientific, and religious concerns about <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a> 
              selection and the manipulation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> germline, the loss of 
              genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> is not one of them. Flesh and Blood As we explore 
              the implications of advanced reproductive technologies, we must 
              keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> the larger <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of the changes now 
              under way. At first glance, <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> reproduction mediated by <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a>s in a modern laboratory seems unnatural 
              and perverted. We are flesh and blood; this is not our place. But 
              by the same token, we should abandon our vast buzzing honeycombs 
              of steel, <a class="thought" href="entries/fiber_optics_entry.html">fiber optics</a>, and concrete. Manhattan and Shanghai bear 
              no resemblance to the African veldt that bore us. </p>
<p>Cocooned in the new environments we have fashioned, we can easily 
              forget our kinship to our <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> ancestors, but roughly 98 percent 
              of our gene sequences are the same as a chimpanzee's, 85 percent 
              are the same as a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>'s, and more than 50 percent of a fruit fly's 
              genes have <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> homologues. The immense differences between us 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a>'s other living creatures are less a result of our 
              genetic and physiological dissimilarities than of the massive cultural 
              construct we inhabit. Understanding this is an <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> 
              in finding the larger meaning of our coming control of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> 
              and reproduction. And if we are to understand the social construction 
              that is the embodiment of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> enterprise and the source of 
              its <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, we need to see its larger <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. 
            </p>
<p>A momentous transition took place 700 million years ago when single 
              cells came together to form multicellular <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. All the plants and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s we see today are but variations on that single theme -- 
              multicellularity. We all share a common origin, a common biochemistry, 
              a common <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, which is why <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers can ferry a jellyfish 
              gene into a rabbit to make the rabbit's skin fluoresce under ultraviolet 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, or use a <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>-hormone gene to make salmon grow 
              larger. </p>
<p>Today we are in the midst of a second and equally momentous <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary 
              transition: the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-led fusion of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> into a vast <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of 
              people, crops, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. A whir of trade and <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a> 
              is binding our technological and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> creations into a vast 
              social <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary dimensions. And this <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>'s emergent 
              powers are expanding our <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> potentials far beyond those 
              of other primates. </p>
<p>This global <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> has taken form in only a few thousand years 
              and grows ever tighter and more interconnected. The process started 
              slowly among preliterate <a class="thought" href="entries/hunter_gatherer_entry.html">hunter-gatherer</a>s, but once humans learned 
              to write, they began to accumulate <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> outside their brains. 
              Change began to accelerate. The storage <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              became essentially unlimited, even if sifting through that <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              on the tablets and scrolls where it resided was hard. Now, however, 
              with the advent of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, the power to <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>ally manipulate 
              and sort this growing body of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is speeding up to the 
              point where such processing occurs nearly as easily as it previously 
              did within our brains. With the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              exploding on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and elsewhere, small wonder that our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              is racing ahead. </p>
<p>The social <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> we have created gives us not only the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>,

              shifts in our lives and values in the past century are not some 
              cultural fluke; they are the child of a larger transformation wrought 
              by the diffusion of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> into virtually every aspect of our 
              lives, by trade and instantaneous global <a class="thought" href="entries/telecommunications_entry.html">telecommunications</a>, and 
              by the growing manipulation of the physical and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> worlds

<p>Critical changes, unprecedented in the long <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, are

<p>The coming challenges of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic enhancement are not going 
              to melt away; they will intensify decade by decade as we continue

              in which it must learn not only to acknowledge its immense new powers, 
              but to figure out how to use them wisely. The choices we face are

<p>Germline <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering embodies our deepest fears about today's revolution

              the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genetic enhancement, challenging as it is, may 
              not be the most difficult possibility we face. Recent breakthroughs 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> could not have been made without the assistance of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized

              wonder whether cybernetic developments that blur the line between 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will overshadow our coming ability to alter ourselves 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly. </p>
<p>The ultimate question of our era is whether the cutting edge of

              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> will soon transcend us. To be the "last humans," 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> humans will modify their <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> sufficiently 
              to differ from us in meaningful ways, seems tame compared to giving 
              way to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, as the Erewhonians so feared. Before we look more 
              deeply at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> enhancement and what it may bring, we

<br>
Probably, but it would be a while before we get it right. We'll really need to define smart first...=)
<br>
<br>
Could that person build a time machine?
<br>
This is a more complicated question, I know a bit about the general and special relativity to say that according to those rules, it is impossible to timetravel. Thats kinda like being impossible to build a perpetual machine that ticks faster and faster. But it would be rather arrogant to think that just because we have the general relativity, there isn't any more physics to be discovered. Perhaps one day some smart guy would find a way to break (or at least make some exceptions to) those laws...

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Actually I  think  the  term  Evolution  that  everybody  has  memorized  from the  lessons  of  school, is  something deeper and  more  complicated  than we think  it as..
<br>
<br>
Evolution is  the  continual improvement and  protection   of  organisms or  the  living  thing and  finally  the  life to  whatever hardships it  comes against..Life  just  wants  to be  no matter  what  kinda purpose  it  carries.it  just  wants to  exist and it  just  wants  to prevail  everywhere and  wants  to stay  alive.
<br>
We are the  conscious life  carriers  and  the  ones  who really are  curious  and  inquisitive  to  learn  about  everything.  starting  from the  nature  of  being or  existence down to which one must exist first hen or  the  chicken.
<br>
Curiosity  is  our disaster  and  our devil in some way.We risk anything just  te  be  aware  and  learn about something  we want to.You know  what first  of  all  we  should  begin to explore ourselves,the brain,the mind,the  consciousness.Why we are  curious?What&#228;s  the  origin of  curiousity?Which brain circuit or which neuron's stammering is  causing  this  effect?
<br>
Actually  everything  lies in our  brain and our  mind.There's  the  truth that we  gotta  find  out.One  said  that we  know  more  about other galaxies than  we  do  our  own selves and our  brains.That's  really  intriguing.
<br>
Coming to why  should  we  reingineer  our  bodies.. Well  that's  the  wish to  become more secure  against  diseases and consequently  living  longer  may  be  never die, live  forever.It's  from the evolutional fear  of death.Coz  we  don't  know  what will  happen next.We are afraid  of sudden end of  everything.I  think fear of  death   and  the fear of hunger  is  the  propeller of  our  actions and  to  some  extent propeller of  our  curiousity.
<br>
I have  seen interesting videos from the  web ..For  example  one  is  about  the  brain and  emergence of  Intelligence in the  Neocortical circuit:  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090227100832/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2874207418572601262&amp;q=intelligence&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-287420741  8572601262&amp;q=intelligence&amp;hl=en</a>
<br>
This one is  about what will  happen to  us when our  Sun explodes as  a  supernova..  Where  will  we  go  then and  is  there  any need to  redesign  our  selves to  be  able  to  adapt  to  other  planets and  galaxies  when  there will  come  time for this :<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090227100832/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3593834791228608577&amp;q=space+documentaries&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=359383479  1228608577&amp;q=space+documentaries&amp;hl=en</a>
<br>
<br>
Actually  I suggest  you  to  see  all  the  space   documentary set of  BBC by  Sam Neill..  It's  gorgeous  with  some  special effects  to  illustrate  the  whole  thing..
<br>
I  think  that redsigning  our  selves will be  a  necessity  after billions  of  years  at  least  when we  will  need  to  escape  our  sun.
<br>
I  think  then  we  will be  the  spreaders  of  life  across  the  whole  universe  may  be  the  other  universes  that  are  beyond  our  observable sight of  our  telescopes which  can see just  45 billion light years.  Beyond  we  can't  even observe  but  we know  that there is  something interesting  and  we  want  to explore  ..we  have  the  mysterious  urge  to  do  so deep  inside  our neurons giving  us  the signals of desire  to learn about..

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hello  Questor.
<br>
Actually  taking  our  natural  life  with  all  the things  like  photosynthesis..  bacteria to produce  oxygen and  all  other  stairs  of  our  ecosystem are  being  thought of  and experiments  have  begun.
<br>
I  suggest  you  too  watch  the set  of  BBC Space Documenraies  by  Sam Neill  on Google Vide..  just  write BBC Space Documentaries  on the  search panel.  u will get all  the  videos that  really  illustrate  and quench most  of  our thirsts.
<br>
One  scientist says  that to  habitize and design  the  atmosphere  and first  of  all to  be  able  to let microscopic organisms  that we  have on earth  survive in there  in other  planets  like Mars .  we  should  first  send polluting  machines to  pollute  the atmosphere and warm up  a  little bit  for  the  primitive organisms to  survive in there.  for example the cyanobacteria type bacteria which sucked up H2 and splashed out oxygen and  as  a result  of  which we could come  to  existence is  something  we can use as  a method of creating  the same atmosphere and the  same  ecosystem in Mars first  and  then in other  planets  throught  our  galaxy  which  there  are  about  400 billion solar  systems and beyond  that 100 billion galaxies in just  ONLY in our  observable 45 billion light  years diameter.Think  about what  we  are going.. Seeing  and  understanding  all  these  I  ponder  that nobody  on earth ..  every  person that is  born to  this  world SHOULDN'T DIE , on the  contrary spread to  this extremely expansive  universe  and explore  the whole  universe..  I  am absolutely  against  some  people  who  say  that the  birth  rates should  be restricted  just  like  the  situation in China and India..and  I am absolutely  sure  that in the  near  future ..  may  be 20-30 years humanity will  be  proud  enough  to  discover  Immortality  and live  forever  after  having  learnt  how  do manipulate  with  the  Genes and  DNA s..  and  manipulate to  play  with them in any  way  he  wants...  Humanity will  prosper , will increase  and will  never die..  we  are  not  gonna live in vain..  instead  we  will  spread  to different corners of  our  universe  and  will  explore  and  look for  the  answers to  our  antique  perennial questions..  we  will  go  further  until  we  don't  find  anything..
<br>
Damn  looking  at  this  it  seems  to  me  that  we  living  at  the  beginning  of  time  where  all  these  things  are  happening..
<br>
About  the mystery  of  life  and  the  nature of  existence..  This puzzle must  be  something which  has gone  the  long  way  and  the  long  time until  us..  may  be trillionth  of  civilizations in the span of  trillionth of  years    
<br>
explored  until  us  and  trillionth  of  civilization will  be  exploring  and will  explore  in the  future..  may  be  we  will  be  lucky  enough  to contact them and  ask  about  everything  that we  wanna  learn from them..  may  be we  will  find  these  puzzles  ourselves..  who  knows.. but one  thing  is absolute  that we  will  keep  going and our  future  is replete with fun and excitement.
<br>
Life is  really  an  interesting  thing  that  no  person will  ever want  to end  it unless the  person is illiterate  enough to  understand  all  of  the  things we  are up  to..  
<br>
So we  keep  going  and  we  gonna  achieve  as  we did in the  past..  
<br>
Nothing  is  impossible,  briefly.. as Nike says.  universe  is  somewhere  where  everything  can change..and  can happen   we'd  better  keep  our  imagination and  fantasy ..  coz  it's  been the  gift of  ours  that propelled the  whole inventions thruout the  history..

<br>
Are you sure? I cannot claim to be any expert in GR, but doesn't it predict the existence of closed time-like curves that allow time travel? True, Stephen Hawkins has draughted the chronology protection conjecture which supposedly disallows time travel for macroscopic objects, but then again he never accepts a wager from anyone betting time travel is possible, because he figures the person could be from the future and knowing full-well time travel is viable.

<br>
As for the idea of humans migrating out into Space, seems a bit daft to me, particularly when the computational capacity of our solar system could support the equivilent of worlds with a population of 6 billion people placed in orbit around every star in the Milky Way galaxy. That would be a FAR better use of resources than the grey-goo attack of humans infesting planets in order to strip-mine their resources to build yet more barely conscious carbon-based lifeforms. IMO.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Actually, there's  no  such  worry  in  our  universe  that humans  will  cause  ecological  and  environmental  disaster  to  the the  planets  and  other  aspects..
<br>
Damn man there  are  400 BILLION solar systems in ONLY ONE GALAXY  which owns at  least 3-5 planets  in  each and  100 BILLION GALAXIES IN OUR  OBSERVABLE  UNIVERSE OF 45 BILLION LIGHT  YEARS DIAMETER.  after  this  how  can you  say  that we  cause  disaster..?  There's  no  such  thing..  even if  we destroy  the  planets we  settle  in we  will  not  able  to  finish  even 1  GALAXY in trillion years  span..  So  we  are  free  to  go..  and  about  TIME .  actually  when  talking about  time..  one  gotta  first  try  to  analyze  philosophically  what  kinda  THING time  is?
<br>
Is  it  something  that we  should  assume  that THE PAST is OCCURING somewhere still? I  don't  think so.  Time is  harder to  define  it. .. TIME IS  JUST  THE  MEASURE OF  THE  MOVEMENT and  movement is  observable  and  there  should  be  some  kinda  INTELLECT to be  able  to  measure  it.  I  am sure  that our  intellects do  know  one  thing  that there's  motion everywhere therefore time is  needed to measure it and  of  course one  of  the things  that makes  us  to  measure  time  is AGING  OF  OUR CELLS..  that  takes  us  to our  end  ..  to  death.. I  am sure  that time is  something  that  exists  RELATIVELY..  so  it' not  something that could be  visited  or lived again..  May be those radio signals of the past  images  and sounds may  be got  to play  the  past once  again but it is against to the  LOGIC .. since there's ALWAYS  NEVERENDING NOW..

Actually  viruses do  have  lots  of uses  if  you could  look from the  point of view  of  evolution.They just  regulate the growth and abnormal rates of  organism  settlement. just  for  the  use of others ..  like the chain of  our  ecosystem. If  you  hate viruses  then you  should  hate  the  whole animals on our  planets..  for  example  why  wolf  exists  and  just  programmed  to  eat flesh? Just  because  it plays  the  role of  sanitar who  cleanses all  the  unwanted and stinking stuff everywhere. Why bats exist? To regulate  the  normal  growth  rate of insects which in an abnormal  rates exploit plant growth that give  us  food and which contribute  to  the breathable air   amount for oxyegn breathing creatures in returning  getting co2 from them.and  the  virus  is beginning  in the  chain ..  that regulates the abnormal  bacteria growth  and  kills  them and the  only  thing  that can tear  apart  bacterias metabolism is  VIRUS nothing more.  if  there weren't  any  viruses then bacterias would be  more in amount and would  be  uncontrolable and  as  a  consequence of  which wouldn't make possible other  multicellular creatures  to  popup  into  existence.Actually  our  nature is  some  kinda  system or computer program, software that controls itself and  regulates  whenever  it is  necessary to  do and  creates enough operations and  agents to  terminate  any  kinda operation and  debug  it  whenever  necessary  and  delete whenever  necessary  and  create another  types  that  would  wisely  and  longly  carry  the  EXISTENCE OF  LIFE itself  as  long  as  possible which  is  it's mission or FUNCTION..  damn man.. we  just  need  to  wake  up  and look  around us.. our  world is  alive.  our  planet  is  breathing  and  controlling  itself much  more  than a supercomputer or  any  other  kinda computing  machine that we even are  not  close  to..
<br>
But  of  course  it's  a  system with 10% mistakes ..  errors  appearing  in the  system.. maybe it's  because of  some  kinda INTERVENE and  INTERFERENCE  of  another  thinking machines and emerging  computing  machines like  us..

So  the  things  we  see  around  us are  really  amazing..  I  am not  a  creationist  nor  an evolutionist..  I  am a  doubter..  scepticist who thinks  that the  ORIGIN and the  MEANING.  REASON for  all  of  this is  something that we  willl  not  reach in the  near  future  and  part  of  which  is  kept  in our MINDS and  the  other  parts  are  distributes thruout  the UNIVERSE may  be  MULTIVERSES..  POLYVERSES..  HYPOVERSES.  TERAVERSES    out  there in the  horizons  where we  will  reach  sometime .. and  will  find  some  other  INTELLECTS  to  speak  about  and ask  from ..if  they also  don't  know  explore  further  together..</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Well I am actually referring to the Matrioska Brain hypothesis of J Robert Bradbury: Take all the planets in a solar system, dismantle them and use the material to build nanocomputers powered by heat exchangers and spread out in concentric orbits around the Sun. You end up with a series of Dyson spheres, only they support computation, not biological life, and each one runs off of the waste heat of the next shell in. At a conservative estimate, an MB could support about a hundred billion times as many inhabitants as Earth, as uploads living in simulation space.
