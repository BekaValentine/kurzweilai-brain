<p><a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">Information technology</a> can be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as a pyramid. At the top 
              are the <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s, the biggest, fastest <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, bought by 
              the biggest, richest institutions. Then come the large <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>s 
              that run companies. After that are the <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a>s for a department, 
              high-powered workstations for demanding applications, and then the 
              common <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. As the cost goes down, the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of these things in 
              use goes up.</p>
<p>Below the <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> are emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that promise to be used in still 
              larger <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s. </p>

<p>A few hundred dollars buys a <a class="thought" href="entries/pda_entry.html">Personal Digital Assistant</a>, a pocket-sized 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> handy for mobile <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>. For tens of dollars, 
              the wristwatch has for many years been the one processor and display 
              that people carry around with them. It is now acquiring new capabilities, 
              such as a pager, or a <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> receiver, or the Swatch <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a> watches 
              used as <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> ski-lift tickets. Europe is also leading the 
              way with smart cards, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s the size of a credit card that are 
              used much the same way, but that store <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> cash instead of 
              requiring <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a remote <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. They were first used to eliminate 
              the need for change to use pay phones, and are now spreading to 
              all areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> commerce. Finally, for tens of cents come 
              the RFID chips that are used to tag things with an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>. 
              These are used in the badges that control <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a workplace, 
              and in tracking laboratory <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. And that's where it stops. No 
              one's been able to fabricate, package, and sell chips for less than 
              about ten cents. While that might not appear to be a severe limit, 
              think about what it leaves off: just about everything!</p>
<p>One of the most frequent challenges presented to me is finding 
              a way to compute for pennies. Companies have a need to track the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, location, and environment of the things they make, but 
              in competitive markets they can't afford to add more than a few 
              cents per item. While it would be nice to be able to walk out of 
              a supermarket without waiting in line because the groceries come 
              tagged with chips that can automatically be scanned by the door, 
              or have your cupboard at home contact the grocery store when it 
              needs restocking, these things won't happen if the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chips 
              add more than a few cents to the cost of the potato chips. A business 
              card that can call up a business's Web page would be convenient, 
              but there wouldn't be a business left if its cards cost more than 
              a few cents.</p>
<p>This is such an intensely <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> question that it becomes an 
              interesting scientific one. It's not possible to reach one-cent 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s just by cutting corners in the fabrication of conventional 
              chips; the whole industry has been trying unsuccessfully to do that 
              for many years. The only way to get there is to be smarter about 
              taking advantage of what <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> already knows how to do.</p>
<p>A clue is provided by the cheapest <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> of all, the shoplifting 
              tag. This is a one-cent one-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> remotely read <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, storing 
              the status of a product (purchased vs. stolen). Many of these, such 
              as the white rectangular strip that you find on a compact disk, 
              are made by a company called Sensormatic. These contain a metallic 
              glass, a thin sheet of a metal alloy that was cooled so quickly 
              when it formed that the atoms were frozen in a random arrangement. 
              It looks like a piece of aluminum foil, but when it is exposed to 
              an oscillating magnetic field it flexes slightly and then rings 
              much like a tuning fork. This resulting oscillation is much too 
              fast to be audible, but it in turn creates an oscillating magnetic 
              field that can be detected. The <a class="thought" href="entries/portal_entry.html">portal</a>s around the door at a CD 
              store contain the coils for exciting and detecting these oscillations.</p>
<p>My student Rich Fletcher was working with Sensormatic on squeezing 
              more functionality into these materials by trimming them to varying 
              lengths so that they would oscillate at different frequencies, and 
              sensing the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of magnets near them by how they shift the frequency. 
              This let him store a few bits in the tag, and use it as a passive 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> user-<a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> controller. By putting the coils in a table 
              instead of a door, Rich could create a work <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> that could distinguish 
              among <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s brought in, and detect how they were moved. Doing 
              that isn't remarkable, but doing it for a penny is. At that cost 
              this capability could be put into most anything, suggesting that 
              smart materials might be able to replace dumb chips. Indeed, Rich 
              has since found many other materials that can be remotely sensed 
              to determine their <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, track their position, and detect properties 
              such as pressure and temperature.</p>
<p>This approach rapidly runs into a limit on the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              that can be stored in a tag because there are not enough distinguishable 
              frequencies. Very little <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> is contained in the call sign of a 
              radio station; the interesting part is the signal the station <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">broadcast</a>s. 
              For a smart material to be able to send out a more complex signal 
              it needs to be nonlinear. If you hit a tuning fork twice as hard 
              it will ring twice as loud but still at the same frequency. That's 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> response. If you hit a person twice as hard they're unlikely 
              just to shout twice as loud. That property lets you learn more about 
              the person than the tuning fork.</p>
<p>I <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to find a nonlinearity that we could use to store more 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in smart material tags. To keep the cost down to a penny it 
              had to be a natural property of the material rather than something 
              that would require elaborate fabrication. An intriguing candidate 
              is the interaction between the atoms in a material. Chemists study 
              these with the technique of <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a>). Magnetic 
              resonance imaging (<a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>) uses exactly the same mechanism, minus the 
              word "nuclear," which might scare patients.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> is performed in much the same way as shoplifting tags are detected, 
              applying an oscillating magnetic field and then listening for the 
              resulting oscillating field. In the tag the oscillation came from 
              a mechanical vibration of the material; in <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> the oscillation arises 
              from the nuclei of the atoms. In a magnetic field these precess 
              like tiny spinning tops. The rate at which they precess depends 
              on the orientation of neighboring nuclei, spinning faster if they 
              point in the same direction for example. By probing these neighboring 
              interactions with <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a>, chemists are able to deduce the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a> applies a magnetic field that varies over <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>, 
              so that the oscillation frequency of a <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> becomes a function 
              of its position.</p>
<p>The more I learned about <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a>, the more puzzled I became. It' usually 
              is performed by putting a tube full of a liquid in a strong magnetic 
              field. A coil wrapped around the tube sends in an oscillating magnetic 
              field to make the nuclei precess, and then detects the resulting 
              magnetic field from the response of the nuclei. The chemists analyze 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> by using the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> 
              describes the bizarre behavior of very small things, not a macroscopic 
              test tube. Quantum mechanically there is nothing preventing this 
              book from splitting into ten copies and leaping to the moon, but 
              the interactions with you and the rest of the world force it to 
              remain sensibly classical. To understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> of how an apparently 
              classical test tube can behave quantum mechanically, I started lugging 
              around a distinctly macroscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> bible that chemists use, a book 
              by Ernst.</p>
<p>I was not getting anywhere until I was forced to do jury duty. 
              For months I had been trying to avoid serving, but I ran out of 
              excuses and had to clear a few days and report to the Cambridge 
              courthouse. There I was locked in the jury room for a day with nothing 
              to do but read Ernst. Freed from all my usual distractions, I finally 
              was able to understand just how elegant the apparently impenetrable 
              and self-referential chemists' <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> is.</p>
<p>In <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> each <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> in the liquid behaves as an independent but 
              identical quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s treat the liquid as a 
              single effective <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> that in <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is represented by an enormous 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of redundant copies. All of the classical interactions needed 
              to hold and interact with the liquid do ruin some of those copies, 
              but there are so many of them that the quantum mechanical properties 
              of the rest can persist for many seconds, plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to perform 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>. This means that <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> provides a convenient way to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> a nonlinear quantum mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Those <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s happen to be exactly what's needed for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> 
              of high-performance computing. The <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for cheap chips was leading 
              to something much more. We've come to expect that every year or 
              so our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s will double in speed and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>. This trend was 
              first noticed by <a class="thought" href="entries/moore_entry.html">Gordon Moore</a> of Intel in 1965, and has continued 
              for the last three decades. It's not a law of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>; it's an observation 
              about remarkable <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. From the very beginning it 
              was clear where this was heading. Each year it appears that it will 
              be hard to continue improving performance, and each year some new 
              tricks are found to squeeze out the next round. But some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> around 
              2020 or so everything will hit bottom. At the rate of current <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, 
              the wires will be one <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> wide, the <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> cells will have one 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>, and the fab plant will cost the GNP of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> so that 
              no one can afford to build it anyway. Further improvements cannot

<p>In part, this doesn't <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> because most of the current <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s 
              on using a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> have nothing to do with the speed of the processor, 
              they come from the user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>, or the power requirement, or 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. A few of the billion dollars spent on building <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> 
              fabs could profitably be used elsewhere. But in part it does <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, 
              because there are some hard problems that always demand faster <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s.</p>
<p>Finding prime factors, for example, is the mathematical problem 
              that underpins the <a class="thought" href="entries/cryptography_entry.html">cryptography</a> used for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> commerce. The 
              difficulty of factoring is what lets you send a credit card <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              from a Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a> without worrying about an eavesdropper obtaining 
              it. A desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can multiply together the factors of a four-hundred-digit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> in an instant, but finding them would take today's fastest 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> the age of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. That is because factoring is an 
              exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>, meaning that doubling the size of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              to be factored squares instead of doubles the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> needed to do 
              it. And beyond factoring, it's also true that builders of each generation 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have confidently predicted that they were sufficient 
              for most applications, only to find entirely new uses for new <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              that weren't anticipated by extrapolating the old ones. I don't 
              feel limited because my desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> isn't one thousand times 
              faster, but that reflects a <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a> of my <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a> as much as 
              an observation about what I think I need a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for.</p>
<p>There aren't many places to turn for alternatives to speed up computing. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a> travels a foot in a billionth of a second, the cycle <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              of today's fastest chips. This means that they cannot be clocked 
              much faster because there isn't <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for the signals to go anywhere.</p>
<p>Another option is to keep the clock speed but use more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              in parallel. Not only would this require an annual doubling of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to keep pace with <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's law</a>, parallelism alone 
              does not scale very well. Scientists have managed to perform logical 
              functions with <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, turning a tube full of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> into an 
              enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, about 10<sup>23</sup> of them. That's 
              a lot. Because they communicate with each other slowly, the easiest 
              way to use them is like a lottery, preparing all possible answers 
              to a problem and then checking to see which <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> has the winning 
              solution. But since the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of possible factors of a cryptographic 
              key is exponential in the size of the key, this means that 10<sup>23</sup>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could simultaneously check for the factors of just a twenty-three-digit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>.</p>
<p>There's only one thing in our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that is exponentially big, 
              but is not used for computing: <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. A classical <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> 
              can be either a 0 or a 1. A <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> governed by the laws of quantum 
              mechanics can simultaneously be a 0 or a 1. To describe it you need 
              to specify the probability that you'll find a 0 if you measure it, 
              and the probability that you'll find a 1. The state of a classical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with <i>N</i> bits is specified by giving those bits, but 
              for a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> it requires giving 2<sup>N</sup> coefficients, 
              one for each possible combination of the bits. For just fifty quantum 
              bits, 2<sup>50</sup> = 10<sup>15</sup>, storing more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              than the largest classical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Because a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              could perform all possible calculations at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, it might 
              be the key to building more powerful 'computers.</p>
<p>This question was first asked in the early 1980s by <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>n 
              at Caltech, Paul Benioff at Argonne National Laboratory, and David 
              Deutsch at Oxford University. Feynmann was struck by the recognition 
              that it takes a classical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> an exponential amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              to model a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, because it has to keep track of all of 
              the possible states of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in parallel. He wondered if a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> governed by the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> might be able 
              to efficiently model other quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Feynmann's conjecture, 
              recently supported by <a class="thought" href="entries/lloyd_entry.html">Seth Lloyd</a> at MIT, had broader implications 
              than he realized.</p>
<p>The study of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> remained a theoretical curiosity 
              through the 1980s, pursued by an unusual collection of people who 
              had to know a great deal about both <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a>, 
              and also be slightly strange. Meetings of this community were a 
              delight because the people involved were so unusual, and the discussion 
              so irrelevant to any practical concerns. That began to change in 
              the early 1990s. A series of results were proved by David Deutsch, 
              Richard Josza of Plymouth University, and Dan Simon, now at <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a>, 
              showing that a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is more powerful than a classical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for a series of increasingly less trivial problems. In 
              1994 Peter Shor of AT&amp;T was able to use these techniques to 
              show that a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could find prime factors in polynomial 
              instead of exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. This made factoring a four-hundred-digit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> almost as easy as multiplying its factors.</p>
<p>These results drew on a second aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> that 
              is even more bizarre than the ability to be in many states simultaneously. 
              If a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> is in a superposition of 0 and 1, and it interacts 
              with a second <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>, the value of the second <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> will depend on the 
              state of the first. If they're now separated to opposite ends of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> and the first <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> is measured, it is forced to decide 
              between being a 0 or a 1. At that instant the value of the second 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> is determined. This appears to be an instantaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> at 
              a distance, something that made Einstein very unhappy. It is called 
              entanglement, and it serves in effect to wire together the bits 
              in a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Without entanglement a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would 
              have the same problem as a <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, trying many answers at 
              the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and then having to locate the correct one, like trying 
              to find a needle in a haystack. With entanglement, a single quantum 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be certain to solve a factoring problem.</p>
<p>Naturally, the three-letter agencies (NSA, CIA, . . . ) panicked. 
              Here was a very real threat to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> security, coming from 
              an entirely unexpected quarter. Since by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the result was 
              already widely known they couldn't cover it up, but they could try 
              to keep ahead of the competition. So they started showing up at 
              meetings, in effect offering a purchase <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to anyone who would 
              build them a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. They started to relax when no one 
              serious would take one. In the next year many people realized just 
              how hard it was going to be to build a practical quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              It would need to be carefully isolated from the rest of the world 
              so that it could stay quantum, but would need to be <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible to 
              the outside world so that the initial conditions could be loaded 
              in, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> run forward, and the answer read out. Papers 
              started to appear saying that quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could not be built.</p>
<p>Then, in 1996, two things happened to scare the three-letter agencies 
              again. The first was the discovery by Peter Shor, Charles Bennett 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>, and Andy Steane of Oxford, that quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/error_correction_entry.html">error correction</a> 
              is possible. Just as classical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s add extra bits to memories 
              to catch mistakes, they realized that quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can use 
              extra quantum bits to fix their errors. This means that an imperfect 
              quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could perform a perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, as long as 
              it is just good enough to be able to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/error_correction_entry.html">error correction</a>.</p>
<p>Here's where <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> comes in. After my day of jury duty I understood 
              that it might be possible to solve the <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a> of connecting the 
              classical and quantum worlds with the chemist's trick. Instead of 
              working with a single <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, if a tube full of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              in the form of a liquid sample in an <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> apparatus was used, then 
              all of the external interactions might ruin a few of them, but since 
              each effective quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> would be represented in an enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s it would retain its <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_coherence_entry.html">quantum coherence</a> for a much longer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. For this idea to work it would have to use natural <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, 
              since it's not feasible to <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly fabricate that many <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              So the question then became whether a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> could compute.</p>
<p>Classically, a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> must be able to flip a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> (the 
              NOT gate), and perform a logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> on two bits (such as 
              the AND gate). Any other logical <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> can be assembled from 
              these <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. Similarly, a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> must be able to 
              rotate a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> to any angle between 0 and 1, and must be able 
              to perform a nonlinear <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> between two bits. These are easy 
              to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a>. The precession of a <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> in a magnetic field 
              is exactly the kind of rotation that is needed, and the interaction 
              between the nuclei provides the nonlinearity.</p>
<p>I arrived for a visit at the Institute for Theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> 
              in Santa Barbara, armed with this <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of how to represent 
              quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in what appears to be a classical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, and 
              how to apply magnetic fields to manipulate the quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. 
              On the first day I stopped by to see <a class="thought" href="entries/chuang_entry.html">Isaac Chuang</a> (now at <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a>), 
              and emerged from his office a week later. He had just finished working 
              out how to reduce a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to a series of equivalent <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s. 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s that he needed and that I knew how to do matched 
              up perfectly.</p>
<p>By the end of the week we had worked out the details of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              a molecular quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. We had an eerie feeling that we weren't 
              really discovering anything, just lifting a curtain to reveal a 
              beautiful <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> that had been there all along waiting for someone 
              to notice it.</p>
<p>A liquid is in fact that most perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that could be built 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. It's easy to obtain in huge quantities, the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s all come perfectly assembled without any manufacturing 
              imperfections, and the cloud of <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s around the <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a> and 
              the rapid tumbling of the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the liquid protect the quantum 
              coherence of the nuclei. Once we understood the connection between 
              liquid <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a> we didn't even need to do a demonstration 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>, because the chemists had been doing them for years. 
              Their molecular studies were showing all of the working <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s 
              of a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, without their realizing that's what they 
              were doing.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a>n gave a seminal talk in 1959 entitled "There's 
              Plenty of Room at the Bottom." He foresaw the problems coming in 
              shrinking <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and wondered if we could jump to making molecular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. This inspired the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> that sought 
              to do just that. Unfortunately, the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> has 
              produced <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful analyses and compelling visions, but very little 
              in the way of working <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. It now turns out that ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s 
              all along have known how to compute&#8212;we just weren't asking 
              them the right questions.</p>
<p>This was one of those ideas that was ready to be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. An MIT/Harvard 
              group found a related way to manipulate quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a 
              liquid, one at Los Alamos found still another, and many groups around 
              the world are now using these techniques to make small quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              The first <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> we did that required fewer steps

              at <a class="thought" href="entries/bell_labs_entry.html">Bell Labs</a> has shown that this can be done in <i>'N</i> steps 
              on a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Our chloroform <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> had four states; 
              our quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> was able to find in a single step the answer 
              that took a few tries classically.</p>
<p>Daunting challenges remain if these demonstration <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s are 
              ever to grow up to exceed the performance of today's fastest classical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, although these are increasingly technological rather 
              than <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual problems. The most severe limit is a rapid decrease 
              in sensitivity for larger <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, but this might be solved by 
              using lasers to align the nuclei. The <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_coherence_entry.html">quantum coherence</a> lasts for 
              thousands of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s, approaching the limit needed to be able 
              to use quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/error_correction_entry.html">error correction</a>. This also needs a technique such 
              as the optical nuclear alignment, to prepare the extra quantum bits 
              used in the <a class="thought" href="entries/error_correction_entry.html">error correction</a>. Finally, as the size of a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> 
              is increased, the interactions between nuclei at the far ends of 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> become too weak to use for computing, but <a class="thought" href="entries/lloyd_entry.html">Seth Lloyd</a> 
              has shown that a polymer with a simple repeating atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              is almost as useful and requires that the nuclei interact only with 
              their nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>These scaling <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s offer a glimpse of an ideal <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>. It should have a regular <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>, so that 
              Seth's technique can be used. Better still, the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> should be 
              2D or 3D rather than a <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> chain, to reduce the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to pass 
              messages around the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. It should have a rigid <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>, 
              so that all of the local atomic environments are identical, and 
              it should have a special <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> at the end that can be used to 
              load in <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and read out results. This sounds disturbingly like 
              a microtubule.</p>
<p>Microtubules are a kind of molecular scaffolding in <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. While 
              there's no compelling <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> to believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> has 
              anything to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, those who do think that it does 
              have come to identify microtubules as the seat of quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. 
              I couldn't begin to guess how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> could perform the kinds 
              of molecular manipulations that we do in <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">NMR</a>, although it is amusing 
              to observe that a head in an <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a> magnet is a perfectly good medium 
              in which to perform a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> may not be the best place to look for guidance in how 
              to build a quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, but it does have a valuable lesson 
              to teach us about how to build more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. Moore's 
              law demands exponential improvements in performance. <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">Quantum mechanics</a> 
              promises one way to do that; <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry offers another.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> are about a million times slower than the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, yet they can instantly perform tasks 
              that tax the fastest <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. There are many more <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> than <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, about 1011 of them, and even 
              more connections among them, roughly 1015 <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s. These <a class="thought" href="entries/synapse_entry.html">synapse</a>s 
              are the key.</p>
<p>Many computing problems reduce to finding good ways to approximate 
              complicated functions. For example, for a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to recognize 
              faces it must have a function that can take as an input the pixels 
              in an image and provide as an output the name associated with the 
              face. There are many techniques for doing this, but they all reduce 
              in the end to some kind of function that relates inputs to outputs. 
              In traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering practice unknown functions are represented 
              by using some family of basis functions, such as a collection of 
              polynomial powers or trigonometric functions, combined with a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> 
              of weighting coefficients. There are relatively straightforward 
              techniques for finding the best coefficients to match a given <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> does it. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> the coefficients 
              correspond to the synaptic connection strengths, and the basis functions 
              are the S-shaped response of the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> uses the coefficients 
              in forming the arguments of the basis functions, rather than using 
              them just to combine the results. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers have historically stayed 
              away from doing this because it can be shown that there's no longer 
              a practical procedure to find the best values for the coefficients. 
              All that can be done is some kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> that learns <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able 
              ones.</p>
<p>The study of <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a>s was inspired by the goal of emulating 
              the organization of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. While the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is still far too 
              complex to model in any detail, simple mathematical <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s that 
              put the unknown coefficients before the nonlinear basis functions 
              were surprisingly successful. It is now understood why.</p>
<p>A characteristic feature of difficult recognition problems is that 
              there may be a huge <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of inputs, such as all of the pixels 
              in an image. In a traditional model, one coefficient is needed for 
              each possible combination of inputs and basis functions. This rapidly 
              explodes, so that if ten are needed for one input, one hundred are 
              needed for two, one thousand for three, and so forth. This is called 
              the "curse of dimensionality." A <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> model is much more 
              flexible. The adjustable coefficients inside the nonlinear functions 
              are far more powerful; the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> required is a polynomial function 
              instead of an exponential function of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of inputs.</p>
<p>Even so, there's still the problem of finding their values. A second 
              result comes to the rescue here. It turns out that these models 
              are so flexible, almost anywhere they start out there is a good 
              solution nearby. A <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> procedure does not need to find the single 
              best solution, just an acceptable one, and there is a huge <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of them. This is ensured by using a large <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, far 
              more than would be considered sane in a conventional model. This 
              property has come to be called the "blessing of dimensionality." 
              It helps explain why <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> is so essential to how the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functions.</p>
<p>So here is the second exponential insight: use models that require 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> the values of coefficients that appear inside nonlinear 
              functions. While this is not applicable to all <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al problems, 
              it works for just the sorts of things that people do well, such 
              as recognizing <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s and prioritizing tasks. A <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              can simulate this kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>, but it's a misplaced application 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> precision. Simpler <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s can do the same 
              thing with far fewer parts.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">Analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s were used in the early days of computing, but they 
              fell out of favor because they accumulate errors. <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              can correct their mistakes and hence perform arbitrarily long <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>s. 
              However, this is not an essential distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Ultimately everything is <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>; the apparently 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> values are a consequence of carefully designed <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s. 
              We're now <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to marry the most desirable features of both 
              worlds, correcting <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> errors while using the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> flexibility 
              to squeeze much more performance out of a simple physical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>For example, Geoff Grinstein of <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> and I studied what are called 
              spread-spectrum coding techniques, which are used to intentionally 
              make a signal appear to be more random than it is. While this may 
              appear to be a perverse aim, it turns out that almost every property 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is improved when they work with effectively 
              random signals (more people can share a <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s channel with 
              less interference, more <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> can be stored on a disk, and so forth). 
              There is a beautiful theory for how to generate bits for use in 
              spread spectrum that appear to be completely random but in fact 
              are entirely predictable. A transmitter uses such a sequence to 
              spread its signal and the receiver then uses an identical copy to 
              recover the message (this idea can be traced back to the actress 
              Hedy Lamarr and composer George Antheil using piano rolls in World 
              War II). This is what you hear when your modem hisses. The catch 
              is that if the receiver is remote from the transmitter it has a 
              difficult computing job to do to figure out the spreading sequence 
              that the transmitter used. This is part of what a <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> receiver must 
              do to lock onto a satellite and find its position.</p>
<p>Two copies of almost any <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, if allowed to interact 
              in almost any way, have a very interesting property: they synchronize. 
              This used to be seen in the simultaneous ticking of mechanical clocks 
              on the wall of a clock shop. Geoff and I wondered if we could use 
              this property to solve the problem of spread-spectrum acquisition. 
              Much to our pleasant surprise, we discovered that we could design 
              simple continuous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that exactly matched the response of the 
              familiar <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> ones for <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> signals, but if they started in 
              the wrong state they could use their <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> to synchronize 
              onto the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> signal. Instead of splitting the job into an <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> 
              detector and then a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> as is done now, a physical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> part can do everything.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world has gone on refining Turing's <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, when even 
              Turing understood its limits. One more area that he made a seminal 
              contribution to was explaining how <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> can form <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s by 
              using chemical reactions. This useful behavior is easy to find in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> but hard to model on a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. Now that we're approaching 
              the end of the era of rapid increases in the performance of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, like Turing we have no choice but to pay more attention 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing in the <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> world.</p>
<p>When Feynmann said that there's plenty of room at the bottom, he 
              meant that there was a long way to go to shrink <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s down to 
              atomic sizes. That's no longer true. With difficulty we are approaching 
              that limit with carefully <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and can now glimpse 
              how to eliminate all that effort by using natural materials. Although 
              he wasn't <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a>, that may carry the most interesting 
              implication of all of his challenge. There's still plenty of room 
              at the bottom to make much cheaper and more widely <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> is not only good at designing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, it has a few lessons 
              left to teach us about manufacturing them.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>just an idea about nanomanufactoring:
<br>
<br>
would it be possible to digitally model a sort of space, just like the negative of a film. If we are talking about replacing atoms in its right place, then why not construct a space filled with right atoms so that they will form or match with the atoms of the object to be constructed through a process, lets say positive/negative charge . Lets call it a negative envelope. when opened, inevitably shall be filled/attracted with the positive atoms to form the object to be constucted nanotechnologically. This whole thing comes from the very idea that positive particules will attract negative ones and vice versa</p></td>
