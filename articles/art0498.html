<div class="TeaserText">Michael Denton asserts that the most basic vital characteristics of organisms, such as self-replication, morphing, self-regeneration, self-assembly and the holistic nature of biological design, cannot be achieved with machines.  If this is the case, then how will consciousness ever be instantiated in a "spiritual machine"?, asks Denton.</div>

              The <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of instantiating the properties and characteristics of 
              living <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s in non-living artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s is almost as old 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. Even in the most primitive of times the magician&#8217;s 
              model or likeness upon which the rituals of sympathetic magic were 
              enacted was believed to capture some essential quality of the living 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> it represented. The magician&#8217;s likeness, Vaucanson&#8217;s 
              famous mechanical duck, which was able to eat and drink and waddle 
              convincingly and was one of the wonders of the Paris salons in the 
              eighteenth century, the <a class="thought" href="entries/golem_entry.html">Golem</a> or artificial man who would protect 
              the Jews of medieval Prague, <a class="thought" href="entries/hal_entry.html">HAL</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> in the film 
              2001: A <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">Space</a> Odyssey, all testify to mankind&#8217;s eternal fascination 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> to create another <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and to steal fire from the 
              gods. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>&#8217;s book The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a> represents 
              only one of the latest manifestations of the long-standing <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a>. 
            </p>
<p>At the outset I think it is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to concede that if living 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous in all <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant respects to artificial 
              mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s and profoundly <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8212;as 
              mechanists since Descartes have always insisted&#8212;then in my 
              view there are no serious grounds for doubting the possibility of 
              Kurzweil&#8217;s &#8220;Spiritual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s.&#8221; The <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> is compelling. 
              Conversely if living things are not <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-like in their <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 
              design&#8212;if they differ in certain critical ways from <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              as the vitalists have always maintained&#8212;then neither artificial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> nor any of the characteristics of 
              living <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are likely to be instantiated in non-living mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>My approach, therefore, is to question the validity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> upon which the whole mechanistic tradition is based. I intend 
              to critique the very presuppositions on which Kurzweil&#8217;s strong 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> project is based, rather than offer detailed analysis of his 
              argument&#8212;a task amply provided by other contributors to this 
              volume. Here I am going to argue that there is no convincing evidence 
              that living <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are strictly <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to artificial/mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s in the way the mechanist claims and that while certain aspects 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> may be captured in <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s there remains the very real 
              possibility, I would say a near certainty, that elusive, subtle, 
              irreducible &#8220;vital&#8221; differences exist between the two 
              categories of being the &#8220;organic&#8221; and the &#8220;mechanical.&#8221; 
              And I would like to suggest that some of the &#8220;vital&#8221; properties 
              unique to organic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, which could well include &#8220;human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>&#8221; and perhaps other aspects of what we call &#8220;human 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>&#8221; may never find exact instantiation in artificial manmade 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s&#8212;a likelihood which would render impossible any sort 
              of &#8220;spiritual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.&#8221; </p>

<h2>The Mechanistic <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">Paradigm</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The emergence of the modern mechanistic view of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> and of the 
              idea that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous in every essential way to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8212;the 
              ultimate source of the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/hofstadter_entry.html">Douglas Hofstadter</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/dennett_entry.html">Daniel Dennet</a>t, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> and of other supporters of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>&#8212;coincided 
              roughly with the birth of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
              centuries. </p>
<p>One of its first and most influential exponents was the great French 
              philosopher <a class="thought" href="entries/descartes_entry.html">Rene Descartes</a>, for whom the entire material <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              was a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8212;a gigantic clockwork mechanism. According to 
              this view all of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>&#8212;from the movement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s to 
              the movements of the heart&#8212;worked according to mechanical laws, 
              and all the characteristics of every material <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> both living 
              and nonliving could be explained in its entirety in terms of the 
              arrangement and movement of its parts. In his own words from his 
              Treatise on Man: </p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>I suppose the body to be nothing but a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> . . . We 
              see clocks, artificial fountains, mills, and other such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              which, although only man made, have the power to move on their own 
              accord in many different ways . . . one may compare the nerves of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> I am describing with the works of these fountains, its 
              muscles and tendons with the various <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and springs which <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> 
              them in <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> . . . the digestion of food, the beating of the heart 
              and arteries . . . respiration, walking . . . follow from the mere 
              arrangement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8217;s organs every <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> as naturally 
              as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangements 
              of its counterweights and wheels. </blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And in his Principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> he explicitly states:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>I do not recognize any difference between <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s and 
              natural bodies . . . </blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Despite occasional <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> backs ever since, Descartes&#8217; <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has followed by and large along mechanistic lines and nearly 
              all the major advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> have arisen from its application. 
            </p>
<p>Today almost all professional biologists have adopted the mechanistic/<a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist 
              approach and assume that the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> parts of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> (like the 
              cogs of a watch) are the primary essential things, that a living 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> (like a watch) is no more than the sum of its parts, and 
              that it is the parts that determine the properties of the whole 
              and that (like a watch) a complete description of all the properties 
              of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> may be had by characterizing its parts in isolation. 
            </p>
<p>The traditional vitalistic alternative has virtually no support. 
              Nowadays few biologists seriously consider the possibility that 
              organic forms (unlike watches) might be natural and necessary parts 
              of the cosmic order&#8212;as was believed before the rise of the 
              mechanistic doctrine. Few believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s might be more than 
              the sum of their parts, possessing mysterious vital non-mechanical 
              properties, such as a self-organizing ability or a genuine autonomous 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, which are not explicable in terms of a series of mechanical 
              interactions between their parts.</p>
<p>Over and over again the vitalist presumption&#8212;that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s 
              possess special vital powers only manifest by the functioning vital 
              whole&#8212;has fallen to the mechanist assault. In the early nineteenth 
              century W&#246;hler synthesized urea, showing for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              that organic compounds, previously considered to require living 
              protoplasm for their manufacture, could be assembled artificially 
              outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> by non-vital means. Later in the nineteenth century 
              enzymologists showed that the key chemical reactions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              could be carried out by <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> extracts and did not depend on the 
              intact <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. The triumphant march of mechanism has continued throughout 
              the twentieth century and its application has led to spectacular 
              increases in <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> particularly over the past four 
              decades. </p>
<p>There is no longer any doubt that many <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> phenomena are 
              indeed mechanical and that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s at 
              least to some degree.</p>
<p>Having achieved so much from the mechanistic approach it is not 
              surprising that the metaphysical assumption of mechanism&#8212;that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are profoundly <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in all significant 
              characteristics&#8212;is all-pervading and almost unquestioned in 
              modern <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s</h2>
<p></p>
<p>On top of the undeniable fact that many <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> phenomena can 
              be explained in mechanical terms, the credibility of the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> has been reinforced over the past few centuries by our ability 
              to construct increasingly <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. </p>
<p>For most of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> man&#8217;s tools or <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s bore no 
              resemblance to living <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s and gave no hint of any <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> 
              between the living and the artificial. Indeed through most of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, 
              through the long intermittent colds of the <a class="thought" href="entries/paleolithic_entry.html">Paleolithic</a>, the only 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s manufactured by man were primitive bone or wooden sticks 
              and the crudely shaped hand axes&#8212;the so-called eoliths or dawn 
              stones. Primitive man was only capable of manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s 
              so crudely shaped that they were hardly distinguishable from natural 
              flakes of rock or pieces of wood and bone. So it is hardly likely 
              that primitive man&#8212;although perhaps as intelligent as modern 
              man&#8212;would have perceived any <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> between his crudely shaped 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s and the living beings that surrounded him. Certainly he 
              would never have dreamt of &#8220;spiritual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.&#8221; </p>
<p>It was not until 10,000 years after the end of the <a class="thought" href="entries/paleolithic_entry.html">Paleolithic</a> 
              era, following the development of metallurgy, the birth of agriculture 
              and the founding of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>s that humans first manufactured 
              complex <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s such as ploughs and wheeled vehicles, consisting 
              of several interacting parts. By classical times many <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s 
              were quite sophisticated, as witness the famous Alexandrian water 
              clock of Ctesibus, Archimedes&#8217; screw and the Roman <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> 
              catapult. Heron of Alexandria wrote several treatises on the construction 
              of lifting <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s and presses. The famous <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> found in a shipwreck 
              off the island of Antiketheria&#8212;the Antiketheria <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>&#8212;contained 
              a gear train consisting of 31 gears compacted into a small box about 
              the size of a laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. This &#8220;computer&#8221; was probably 
              a calendrical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> for calculating the position of the sun, moon 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s. </p>
<p>Although the technological accomplishments of classical times were 
              quite sophisticated, it was not until the seventeenth century and 
              the beginning of the modern era that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> had advanced to 
              the stage when <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s began to take on <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-like characteristics. 
            </p>
<p>Ten years before the century opened in 1590, the compound microscope 
              was invented. The telescope was invented in 1608 by the Dutchman 
              Lipershay, shortly afterwards <a class="thought" href="entries/galileo_entry.html">Galileo</a> invented the thermometer, 
              one of his pupils Toricelli the barometer, and in 1654 Guericke 
              invented the air pump. Over the same period clocks and other mechanisms 
              were being vastly improved. At last <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, such as the telescope 
              and microscope with their lens and focusing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to 
              that of the vertebrate eye, or hydraulic pumping <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, which 
              were <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to the <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> of the heart, began crudely to exhibit 
              some of the characteristics and properties of living things. The 
              fantastic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering drawings of <a class="thought" href="entries/da_vinci_entry.html">Leonardo Da Vinci</a>, envisaging 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic flying and walking <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, lent further support to 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a>. </p>
<p>The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also saw the first successful 
              attempts at constructing <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-like automata. Vaucanson&#8217;s duck, 
              for example, which was constructed in about 1730, had over 1,000 
              moving parts and was able to eat and drink and waddle convincingly. 
              It became one of the wonders of the eighteenth century Parisian 
              salons and represented a forerunner of the robots of today and the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>. Such advances raised the obvious possibility 
              that eventually all the characteristics of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> including <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              self- reflective <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> might find instantiation in mechanical 
              forms. </p>
<p>Since the days of Descartes <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has of course advanced to 
              levels that were simply unimaginable in the seventeenth century. 
              At an ever-accelerating rate one technological advance has followed 
              another. And as <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have continually grown in <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and 
              sophistication especially since the seventeenth century the gap 
              between living things and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s seems to have continually narrowed. 
              Every few decades <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have seemed to grow more <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-like until 
              today there seems hardly a feature of complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s does not 
              have some <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ue in living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Like <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s use 
              artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> banks for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> storage and 
              retrieval. To decode these <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, like <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s, use 
              complex translational <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Modern <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry utilizes elegant 
              control <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s regulating the assembly of parts and <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, 
              error fail-safe <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s and proofreading <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are utilized for 
              quality control, assembly processes utilize the principle of prefabrication. 
              All these phenomena have their parallel in living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. In fact, 
              so deep and so persuasive is the <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> that much of the terminology 
              we use to describe the world of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> is borrowed from the world 
              of late twentieth century <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. </p>
<p>From stone axe-head to modern <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> mankind has journeyed 
              far, very far since the long colds of the <a class="thought" href="entries/paleolithic_entry.html">Paleolithic</a> dawn. And 
              given the increasing &#8220;life-likeness&#8221; of many modern <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s 
              it seems likely, or so the mechanist would have us believe, that 
              eventually all the phenomena of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> will be instantiated in mechanical 
              forms. Surely the day of <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>ual <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s can hardly be that far 
              away?</p>

<h2>Organic Form: Vital Characteristics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Yet despite the obvious successes of mechanistic <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> 
              and the fact that many <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> phenomena can be reduced to mechanical 
              explanations, and despite the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have grown ever 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-like as <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has advanced&#8212;it remains an undeniable 
              fact that living things possess abilities that are still without 
              any significant <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ue in any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> which has yet been constructed. 
              These abilities have been seen since classical times as indicative 
              of a fundamental division between the vital and mechanical modes 
              of being. </p>
<p>To begin with, every living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> replicates itself, yet no <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              possesses this <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> even to the slightest degree. Nor has any 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>&#8212;even the most advanced envisaged by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologists&#8212;been 
              conceived of that could carry out such a stupendous act. Yet every 
              second countless trillions of living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s from <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l cells 
              to elephants replicate themselves on the surface of our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. 
              And since life&#8217;s origin, endless <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms have effortlessly 
              copied themselves on unimaginable <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s of occasions. </p>
<p>Living things possess the ability to change themselves from one 
              form into another. For example, during development the descendants 
              of the egg <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> transform themselves from undifferentiated unspecialized 
              cells into wandering amoebic cells, thin plate-like blood cells 
              containing the <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>-transporting <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> hemoglobin, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s&#8212;cells 
              sending out thousands of long tentacles like miniature medusae some 
              hundred thousand times longer than the main body of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. </p>
<p>The ability of living things to replicate themselves and change 
              their form and <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> are truly remarkable abilities. To grasp 
              just how fantastic they are and just how far they transcend anything 
              in the realm of the mechanical, imagine our <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s endowed with 
              the ability to copy themselves and&#8212;to borrow a term from <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> 
              fiction&#8212;&#8220;morph&#8221; themselves into different forms. 
              Imagine televisions and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that duplicate themselves effortlessly 
              and which can also &#8220;morph&#8221; themselves into quite different 
              types of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8212;a television into a microwave cooker, or 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> into helicopter. We are so familiar with the capabilities 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> that we take them for granted, failing to see their truly 
              extraordinary character. </p>
<p>Even the less spectacular self re-organizing and self regenerating 
              capacities of living things&#8212;some of which have been a source 
              of wonderment since classical times&#8212;should leave the observer 
              awestruck. Phenomena such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of a complete tree from 
              a small twig, the regeneration of the limb of a newt, the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              of a complete polyp, or a complex <a class="thought" href="entries/protozoan_entry.html">protozoan</a> from tiny fragments 
              of the intact <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> are again phenomena without <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ue in the 
              realm of mechanism. To grasp something of the transcending <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              of this remarkable <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>, imagine a jumbo jet, a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, 
              or indeed any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> ever conceived from the fantastic <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> ships 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> to the equally fantastic speculations of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, 
              being chopped up randomly into small fragments. Then imagine every 
              one of the fragments so produced (no two fragments will ever be 
              the same) assembling itself into a perfect but miniaturized copy 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> from which it originated&#8212;a tiny toy-sized jumbo 
              jet from a random section of the wing&#8212;and you have some <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion 
              of the self regenerating capabilities of certain microorganisms 
              such as the ciliate Stentor. It is an achievement of transcending 
              brilliance, which goes beyond the wildest dreams of mechanism. </p>
<p>And it is not just the self-replicative, &#8220;morphing&#8221; or 
              self-regenerating <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> which has not been instantiated in mechanical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Even the far less ambitious end of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> self-assembly 
              has not been achieved to any degree. This facility is utilized by 
              every living <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> and is exhibited in processes as diverse 
              as <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> folding, the assembly of viral capsules and the assembly 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> organelles such as the ribosome. In these processes tens 
              or hundreds of unique and <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly complex <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s combine 
              together, directed entirely by their own intrinsic properties without 
              any external intelligent guidance or control is an achievement without 
              any <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ue in modern <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in spacecraft, in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, or 
              even in the most outrageous speculations of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologists. Imagine 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of roughly hewn but quite unfinished <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s of a clock&#8212;several 
              dozen ill-fitting cogs, wheels, axles, springs and a misshapen clock 
              face completely incapable of fitting together to make a clock in 
              their current &#8220;primary&#8221; unfinished state, so out of alignment 
              and so imperfectly hewn, so different in form from their final state 
              and purpose that the end they are intended to form could never be 
              inferred. Now imagine the <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to be animated by some magic force 
              and beginning to come together piece by piece, this <a class="thought" href="entries/cog_entry.html">cog</a> and that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/cog_entry.html">cog</a>, this wheel and this axle. Imagine that as they interact together 
              each changes or more properly reshapes its neighbor so that they 
              both come to fit perfectly together; and so through a series of 
              such mutual self-forming activities the whole animated <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              is transformed, again, as if by magic, into the form of a functioning 
              clock. It is as if the original parts &#8220;knew&#8221; the end for 
              which they were intended and had the ability to fashion themselves 
              towards that end, as if an invisible craftsman were fashioning the 
              parts to their ordained end. It is not hard to see how <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> 
              came to postulate an entelechy or <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> as the immanent directive 
              force organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> to its ordained end. </p>
<p>Such an animated self-assembly process, like the formation of a 
              whole <a class="thought" href="entries/protozoan_entry.html">protozoan</a> from a tiny fragment of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, is another vital 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of transcending brilliance absolutely unparalleled in any 
              mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Finally I think it would be acknowledged by even ardent advocates 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> like Kurzweil, Dennett and Hofstadter that no <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              has been built to date which exhibits <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and can equal 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> ability of humans. Kurzweil himself concedes this much 
              in his book. As he confesses: &#8220;Machines today are still a million 
              times simpler than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Their <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and subtlety 
              is comparable to that of <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s.&#8221; Of course Kurzweil believes, 
              along with the other advocates of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> that sometime in the 
              next century <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s capable of carrying out 20 million billion 
              calculations per second (the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>) will be 
              achieved and indeed surpassed. And in keeping with the mechanistic 
              assumption that organic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are essentially the same as <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              then of course such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will equal or surpass the <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              of man. My prediction would be that such <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be wonderfully 
              fast <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s but will still not possess the unique characteristics 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the ability for conscious rational self-reflection. 
              In his book G&#246;del, Escher, Bach, Hofstader&#8212;himself a believer 
              in the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a>&#8212;makes the point explicitly 
              that the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> project is dependent on the mechanistic or <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ist 
              faith. </p>
<p>Although the mechanistic faith in the possibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/strong_ai_entry.html">strong AI</a> 
              still runs strong among <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers in this field, Kurzweil being 
              no exception, there is no doubt that no one has manufactured anything 
              that exhibits <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> remotely resembling that of man. </p>
<p>It is clear then that living <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s do exhibit certain very obvious 
              characteristics including <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, 
              self-assembly, self-reorganization and for morphological transformations 
              which are without <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> in any <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> contrivance. Moreover, these 
              are precisely the characteristics which have been viewed since classical 
              times as the essential defining characteristics of the vital or 
              organic realm.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Organic Form: A Unique Holistic <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">Order</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to possessing the unique abilities discussed above, 
              it is also evident that the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> design of organic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> macromolecules to <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s and brains exhibits a unique 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> which is without <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> in the mechanical realm. This unique 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> involves a reciprocal formative influence of all the parts 
              of an organic whole on each other and on the whole in which they 
              function. </p>
<p>The philosopher <a class="thought" href="entries/kant_entry.html">Immanuel Kant</a> clearly recognized that this &#8220;reciprocal 
              formative influence of the parts on each other&#8221; is a unique 
              characteristic of organic form. In his famous analysis of organic 
              form in Critique of Teleological Judgment he argues that an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> 
              is a being in which &#8220;the parts . . . combine themselves into 
              the unity of a whole by being reciprocally cause and effect of their 
              form. . . . (and this unity) may reciprocally determine in its turn 
              the form and combination of all the parts.&#8221; He continues: </p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>. . . In such a natural product as this every part is 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> as owing its presence to the agency of all the remaining 
              parts and also as existing for the sake of the others and of the 
              whole . . . the part must be an organ producing the other parts, 
              each consequently reciprocally producing the others.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>He then contrasts the reciprocal formative influence of the parts 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s with the non-formative relationships between parts 
              in mechanical wholes: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>In a watch, one part is the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a> by which the movement 
              of the others is affected, but one wheel is not the efficient cause 
              of the production of the other. One part is certainly present for 
              the sake of another, but it does not owe its presence to the agency 
              of that other. For this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> also the producing cause of the watch 
              and its form is not contained in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of this material. Hence 
              one wheel in the watch does not produce the other and still less 
              does one watch produce other watches by utilizing or organizing 
              foreign material. Hence it does not of itself replace parts of which 
              it has been deprived.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Kant concludes with an insightful definition of <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s as beings 
              &#8220;in which every part is both means and end, cause and effect.&#8221; 
              In his view such &#8220; an organization has nothing <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to 
              any causality known to us.&#8221; He refers to it as an &#8220;impenetrable 
              property&#8221; of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. </p>
<p>Perhaps no organic forms illustrate this unique <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> more clearly 
              than the simplest of all organic forms, the vital building blocks 
              of all life&#8212;the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a>s are the very stuff of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. 
              All the vital chemical functions of every <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> are all 
              in the last analysis dependent on the activities of these tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, the smallest and simplest of all the known <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of organic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">Protein</a>s are also the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> building blocks of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> for 
              it is largely by the association of different <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that 
              all the forms and <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s of living things are generated. </p>
<p>It is immediately obvious even to someone without any previous 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> or without any scientific training 
              that the arrangement of the atoms in a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> is unlike any ordinary 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> or any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> conceived. Indeed the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> is unlike any 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> of common <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. One superficial observation is the 
              apparent illogic of the design and the lack of any obvious modularity 
              or regularity. The sheer <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> of the arrangement of the atoms conveys 
              an almost eerie other-worldly non-mechanical impression. </p>
<p>Interestingly a similar feeling of the strangeness and <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> of 
              the arrangement of atoms in a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> struck the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers at 
              Cambridge University after the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, myoglobin, had been determined in 1957 (using the technique 
              of X-ray crystallography). Something of their initial feelings are 
              apparent in Kendrew&#8217;s comments at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> (reported by M. 
              Perutz in the <i>European Journal of Biochemistry 8</i> (1969): 
              455-466:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Perhaps the most remarkable features of the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> are 
              its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> and its lack of symmetry. The arrangement seems to 
              be almost totally lacking in the kind of regularities which one 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/instinct_entry.html">instinct</a>ively anticipates, and it is more complicated than had been 
              predicted by any theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the late fifties, as the first three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s were worked out, it was first assumed&#8212;in conformity 
              with mechanistic <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>&#8212;that each amino acid made an <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              and independent contribution to the 3D form of the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. This 
              simplifying assumption followed from the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s as 
              &#8220;molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s&#8221; in the literal <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. This implied 
              that their design should be like that of any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, essentially 
              modular, built up from a combination of independent parts each of 
              which made some unique definable contribution to the whole. </p>
<p>It soon became apparent, however, that the design of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s was 
              far more complex than scientists first assumed. In fact, the contribution 
              of each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> amino acid to the tertiary <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> of a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> was not straightforward but was influenced by subtle interactions 
              with many of the other amino acids in the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. After thirty 
              years of intensive study it is now understood that the spatial conformation 
              adopted by each segment of the amino acid chain of a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> is 
              specified by a complex web of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> or electro-chemical interactions, 
              including <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> bonds and hydrophobic forces, which ultimately 
              involve directly via short range or indirectly via long range interaction 
              virtually every other section of the amino acid chain in the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. 
              It might be claimed with only slight exaggeration that the position 
              of each one of the thousands of atoms is influenced by all the other 
              atoms in the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> and that each <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> contributes via immensely 
              complex co-operative interactions with all the other atoms in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>, something to the overall shape and function of the whole 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. </p>
<p>The universal occurrence in <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s of various structural motifs 
              such as alpha helices and beta sheets conveys the impression that 
              they represent independent or relatively independent <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              or separable modules. On the contrary, the stability and form of 
              such motifs is determined by a combination of short-range interactions 
              within the motif and the microchemical environment which it occupies 
              within the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> which is in turn generated by the global web 
              of interactions between all the constituent atoms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. 
              This is evidenced by the fact that the same amino acid sequence 
              often adopts quite different secondary structural conformations 
              in different <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s. The form and properties of each <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> 
              or part of a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> or group of atoms&#8212;whether it is a major 
              structural motif or a small twist in the amino acid chain&#8212;is 
              dependent on its chemical and physical <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> or environment within 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>. This <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> is itself generated by the summation of 
              all the chemical and physical forces, which make up the whole undivided 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> itself.</p>
<p>There is no doubt then that <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s are very much less modular 
              than <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, which are built up from a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of relatively independent 
              modules or compartments. Remove the <a class="thought" href="entries/cog_entry.html">cog</a> from a watch and it still 
              remains a <a class="thought" href="entries/cog_entry.html">cog</a>, remove the wheel from a car and it remains a wheel. 
              Remove a fragment of a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> and its form disassembles. What a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> represents is an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> in which all the &#8220;parts&#8221; 
              are in a reciprocal formative relationship with each other and with 
              the whole. The parts of the final whole are shaped and finished 
              by reciprocal interaction with each other. </p>
<p>In the four decades since <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers determined the 3D atomic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> of the first <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> (myoglobin), we have learned 
              much about the molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> of these remarkable <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. 
              Although still widely described in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> literature as 
              molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s transcend mechanism in their <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, 
              in the intense functional integration and interdependence of all 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s, in the holistic way that the form and function 
              of each part is determined by the whole and vice versa and in the 
              natural formative process by which the amino acid chain is folded 
              into the native function. In these ways, they resemble no <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> constructed or conceived by man. </p>
<p>What is true of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s is also true of the other class of large 
              macromolecules in the cell&#8212;the <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. These too fold 
              into complex three-dimensional forms in which all the parts in the 
              final form are shaped by similar reciprocal formative interactions 
              with the other parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>. Again the distinctive shapes 
              and forms of the constituent parts only exist in the whole. When 
              removed from the whole, they take on a different form and <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of 
              properties or disassemble into a random chain.</p>
<p>The next level of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> above the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s are the multiprotein complexes that make up most 
              of the cell&#8217;s mass and carry out all the critical synthetic, 
              metabolic and regulatory activities on which the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              depends. These include complexes such as the ribosome (the <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>- 
              synthesizing apparatus), which contains more than 55 different <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and three <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, the transcriptional apparatus 
              which makes the mRNA copy of the gene, which again consists of more 
              than 20 <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, and a variety of higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> structural 
              complexes including the cytoskeleton <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, which consists of a 
              highly complex integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of microtubules, microfilaments and 
              intermediate fibers. </p>
<p>It is true of virtually all these multimolecular assemblies that 
              the parts in their final form&#8212;just like the parts of a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>&#8212;have 
              a reciprocal formative influence on each other. So again, in a very 
              real <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> the parts do not exist outside the whole. The ribosome 
              illustrates. The assembly of the ribosome takes place in a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> 
              of stages involving the stepwise association of the 55 <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s 
              with each other and with the three <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. As the assembly 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>es the growing <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> complex undergoes conformational 
              changes, some relatively minor and some major, until the final mature 
              functional form of the ribosome is generated. The process is cooperative, 
              with all parts of the growing <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> having a formative influence 
              on all other parts either directly, because the &#8220;parts&#8221; 
              are adjacent, or indirectly through global influences. </p>
<p>The next readily recognizable level we reach as we ascend the organic 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> is the living <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. Again the parts of a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>, like those 
              of a <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> or a ribosome, are existentially dependent on their 
              being &#8220;parts&#8221; of the greater whole&#8212;the totality of 
              dynamic activities which make up the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. Take 
              them out of the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> and eventually all will die and disintegrate, 
              even if some of their activities may persist long enough for in 
              vitro <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al analyses. Every process, every <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> exists 
              only as a result of the dynamic interaction of the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> in 
              which they function.</p>
<p>The reciprocal formative relationship between parts and between 
              parts and whole which is observed in <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s, multimolecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              and cells is also characteristic of all higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> organic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s&#8212;including 
              organs like the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and whole developing <a class="thought" href="entries/embryo_entry.html">embryo</a>s. Again, in all 
              cases the parts are existentially dependent on being part of the 
              whole in which they function. </p>

<h2>Organic Form: The Failure of <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">Reduction</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>It is primarily because of the unique holistic <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of organic 
              form, in which parts are existentially dependent on their being 
              in the whole and have no real <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> outside the whole, that 
              the mechanist goal of providing a complete explanation of the behavior 
              and properties of organic wholes from a complete characterization 
              of the parts in isolation is very far from being achieved.</p>
<p>From <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the genes of an <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> it is impossible to 
              predict the encoded organic forms. Neither the properties nor <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s nor those of any higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> forms&#8212;such 
              as ribosomes and whole cells&#8212;can be inferred even from the 
              most exhaustive analysis of the genes and their primary products, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> sequences of amino acids. In a very real <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> organic forms 
              from <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> are not specified in the genes but 
              rather arise out of reciprocal self-formative interactions among 
              gene products and represent genuinely emergent realities which are 
              ever- present&#8212;at least in potential&#8212;in the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. 
            </p>
<p>And it is precisely because of the impossibility of prediction 
              and design of organic form from below, that <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering new <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              forms is fantastically difficult. In these days of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              we hear so much about &#8220;transforming life&#8221; and &#8220;re-designing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s&#8221; that it comes as something of a surprise to learn 
              that not even one completely new functional <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> containing only 
              100 subunits (amino acids) has been designed successfully, let alone 
              something as complex as a new type of <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> or a cellular organelle 
              like a ribosome, <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s containing on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of 10,000 subunits 
              (amino acids and <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleotide_entry.html">nucleotide</a>s).</p>
<p>The total failure of <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>ism in the realm of the organic and 
              the total failure to <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er new forms, contrasts markedly with 
              the situation in the realm of the mechanical. In the case of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              from jumbo jets to typewriters, the properties and behavior of the 
              whole can be predicted entirely and with great accuracy from below, 
              that is, from an exhaustive characterization of their parts in isolation. 
              It is because the parts of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s do not undergo complex reciprocal 
              self-formative interactions but have essentially the same properties 
              and form in isolation as they do in the mechanical whole that makes 
              their design possible. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s are no more than the sum of their 
              parts in isolation. And this is why we have no trouble assembling 
              complex <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s like <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttles or jet airliners that contain 
              more than a million unique <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s. Yet no <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a> has ever 
              been built, even one consisting of only 100 <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s (the same 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s as in a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>), which exhibits a reciprocal 
              self-formative relationship between its parts. This unique property, 
              as we have seen above, is the hallmark of organic design. </p>
<p>Organic design is essentially a top-down <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. As we have seen, 
              organic forms are essentially nonmodular wholes and their <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              is intrinsic to, and only manifest in, the functioning whole. Success 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering new organic forms from <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s up to <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s will 
              therefore require a completely <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> approach, a sort of designing 
              from &#8220;the top down.&#8221; Because the parts of organic wholes 
              only exist in the whole, organic wholes cannot be specified <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> and built up from a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of relatively independent modules; 
              consequently the entire undivided unity must be specified together 
              in toto. </p>
<p>If <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s and other higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> organic forms had been built 
              up mechanically out of modules, each of which had the same form 
              in an isolated state that it has in the final form&#8212;rather like 
              the parts of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, the cogs of a watch or pieces in a child&#8217;s 
              erector <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> such as Legos&#8212;then the problem of predicting organic 
              form would have been solved years ago. By now the world would be 
              full with all manner of new &#8220;artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms&#8221; </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The Organic and the Mechanical: Two Distinct Categories of Being</h2>
<p></p>
<p>From the evidence discussed above it is clear that the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>/<a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> is only superficial. Although <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s do exhibit mechanical 
              or <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-like properties they also possess properties which no 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> exhibits even to a minor degree. In addition, the design 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> exhibits a &#8220;holistic&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> which is without parallel 
              in the realm of the mechanical and which cannot be reduced to or 
              explained in mechanical terms. Consequently, no new organic form 
              has been <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered to date. There is self-evidently a gulf between 
              the organic and the mechanical, which has not been bridged.</p>
<p>The picture of organic form that has emerged from recent advances 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> is surprisingly consistent with the pre-mechanistic holistic/vitalistic 
              model, which was first clearly formulated by the Greeks and specifically 
              by <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>. According to their view, each organic whole or form 
              was believed to be a unique integral whole or indivisible unity. 
              This whole&#8212;in effect a self-sufficing <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> or entelechy&#8212;regulated, 
              organized and determined the form, properties and behavior of all 
              of its <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> parts. Taken to its logical conclusion this model 
              implied that only wholes have any real autonomous <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> and 
              that the parts of wholes have no independent <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> or meaning 
              outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of the whole.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> expressed this <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> in The Parts of <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">Animal</a>s:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<blockquote>When any one of the parts or <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s, be that which 
              it may, is under discussion, it must not be supposed that it is 
              its material composition to which attention is being directed or 
              which is the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> of the discussion, but the relation of such 
              part to the total form. Similarly, the true <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> 
              is not bricks, mortar, or timber, but the house; and so the principal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> of natural <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> is not the material <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s, but their 
              composition, and the totality of the form, independently of which 
              they have no <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>. </blockquote>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the Greeks all natural <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s including organic forms were 
              an integral part of the world <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, or Cosmos. Each organic whole 
              or form was therefore an eternal unchangeable part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> 
              fabric of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. Each was &#8220;a potential awaiting actualization&#8221; 
              &#8220;animated by an immanent finality,&#8221; in the words of Genevieve 
              Rodis -Lewis. Its design, the purposeful arrangement of parts to 
              wholes, was internal to the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a> itself&#8212;an outcome of the 
              &#8220;inner developmental force which impelled it towards the realization 
              of its form,&#8221; [Rodin-Lewis G (1978). &#8220;Limitations of the 
              Mechanical Model in the Cartesian <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">Concept</a>ion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">Organism</a>,&#8221; 
              in Descartes, ed. M. Hooker (Baltimore: John Hopkins University 
              Press, Pp. 152- 170.)] Or in the words of the Cambridge Companion 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a> the organic form is &#8220;an internal structural principle 
              striving to actualize itself as the fully mature <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>.&#8221; 
              (Cambridge Companion to <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>, Ed. J Barnes, 1995). As Jonathon 
              Lear puts it in his <a class="thought" href="entries/aristotle_entry.html">Aristotle</a>: The Desire to Understand: Natural 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s &#8220;are foci of <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> and self-determination . . . 
              possessing&#8230;an inner <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> of their own <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s occupying a 
              fundamental ontological position: they are among the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> things 
              that are.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is not the place for a detailed exposition or defense of the 
              Greek <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ion of the <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>. Suffice to say that for the Greeks 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s were a totally different type of being to that of lifeless 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s. If we leave out the <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> we are left with a holistic 
              model of the organic world, which is very close to that revealed 
              by modern <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. </p>
<p>In my view the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s belong to different 
              categories of being is beyond dispute, even if the final <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              of this fundamental difference is not yet clearly defined. And surely 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of this &#8220;vital&#8221; difference raises profound 
              doubts as to the validity of Kurzweil&#8217;s claim. For, if we are 
              incapable of instantiating in mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s any of the &#8220;lesser&#8221; 
              vital characteristics of <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>, &#8220;morphing,&#8221; 
              self-regeneration, self-assembly and the holistic <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> 
              design, why should we believe that the most extraordinary of all 
              the &#8220;vital characteristics&#8221;&#8212;the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> for 
              conscious self-reflection&#8212;will ever be instantiated in a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>?</p>
<p>And it is not just Kurzweil&#8217;s claims that are in doubt. If 
              the traditional vitalist position is true, and organic forms are 
              integral parts of the cosmic <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a>, each being in essence an indivisible 
              self-sufficing unity possessing properties and characteristics beyond 
              those possessed by any <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, properties which might include for 
              example intelligent self-organizing capabilities, then <i>all <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> 
              becomes re-enchanted</i>. The whole mechanistic framework of modern 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> would have to be abandoned, along with many key doctrines, 
              including the central dogma of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/determinism_entry.html">determinism</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> 
              of the &#8220;passivity and impotence&#8221; of the <a class="thought" href="entries/phenotype_entry.html">phenotype</a> and 
              the spontaneity of mutation. Moreover all theories of the origin 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> would have to be 
              re-formulated in conformity with vitalistic principles and all explanations 
              based on the mechanistic <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s as fundamentally lifeless 
              contingent combinations of parts&#8212;including contemporary Darwinism&#8212;would 
              have to be revised. Even certain traditional design arguments such 
              as Paley&#8217;s would have to be reconsidered, since they presume 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s are <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s, being in essence contingent 
              and unnecessary, and thus, like <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s, require an artificer 
              or craftsmen for their assembly. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>"...It is clear then that living systems do exhibit certain very obvious characteristics including intelligence, the capacity for self-replication, self-assembly, self-reorganization and for morphological transformations which are without analogy in any human contrivance..." says Mich'l Denton--but I say, be careful.  There are analogies, and there are exceptions for things that M.D. may find inconvenient in his argument.  Granted, current day technology does not allow for a one-to-one analogy of artificial life to natural life, but this isn't reason enough to disqualify a different avenue of intellect as unliving.  And in the artificial world, there is more than one source of artificial life.
<br>
<br>
What do I mean?  Lets consider an example in the 'living' world and compare it to a similarity in the artificial that was ill addressed.  A vehicle [an American M1-A1 abrahms tank, possibly] within which one or more human's are found, if not seen, itself behaves like an intellectual, intelligent, reasoning, and possibly apprehensive entity.  But it is not... it is simply a shell for the intelligent and emotional being[s] within...  Beings whose genetic code were over 3 billion years in the making.  The tank acts out the will of an acceptably sentient core.   Though devices are not biological, though they cannot yet self replicate on a component level, their software is closer to being able to do just that.  Already there exists software that can take on biological traits, if only on an intellectual level similar to that of insects.  As technology advances, software may gain a certain consciousness that is comparable to sentience, and when that happens, it may not need to be the device that is living... it may be analogous only to the tank and not the organism within.
<br>
<br>
So what?  I'm loathe to accept that a responsive, thinking, and possibly emotional program cannot be considering living, simply because it is made of silicon and self-aligning bucky-tubes or because its components are not cells and proteins.  And, quite frankly, these things simply do not feel impossible within themselves.  Computer chips, cars... in fact, almost everything nowadays is built by other machines.  Granted, these robotic arms are not allowed the capacity to learn and adapt, judge and react... but it IS an example of machines building machines.  Though the reference is obscure, there even exists a term for self-replicating devices--the 'von neumann' device.   And given enough memory, throughput, and parallels of computation, and the software to enable their use, these devices can, at the very least, take on the role of very intelligent and apt builders of their own kind.  We may not be able to assign or detect spirituality within these softwares and devices, but it is only a matter of time before will be self reliant, self editing, and peers in the realms of judgement, adaptability, and intellect.  
<br>
<br>
Simply put, we're so uninformed about our own spirituality... our own souls, that we really shouldn't judge too harshly when a synthetic form of intelligence evolves out of what is still a very youthful computer 'universe'...  Which draws me to one more possible inconvenient analogy.  The universe... on a grand scale, it is not unlike a living organism.  Stars are made of basic elements, much like our cells are made of basic constituents and proteins.  They, of their own accord, live, breathe, expend, and die... and in their death provide the means of new birth.  They collect into megastructures that could be considered organs within a greater megastructure bodies that are galactic clusters which exist within a society of galactic strings and walls that make up a strangely foam-like universe.  All biological analogies for an arguably nonliving, inorganic thing.  Due to its similarity to a living sponge, should we call the universe a living thing, or can we disconnect ourselves enough from strict definitions to allow it to simply be the universe, and also enough to be able to consider a responsive and self-editing software as something closer to a living thing than it is not.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
The image we have of the organism as something soft, mobile, and marvelously complex seems impossible to create through the crude industrial processes of the 20th century factory.
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, as we shall soon see in this century, the processes of self replication and self assembly of intelligent machines at the molecular level will rapidly close the gap that exists today between machines and organisms.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the process is going the other way as well. From titanium hips to ear and eye implants, the human organism is being fitted out with non-organic components. As this process grows more sophisticated, the physical augmentation of the human body will transform the species into something quite different from what it is today.
<br>
<br>
As the larger process unfolds, the dividing line between machines and organisms will blur until it is finally a distinction that no one cares to make. The evolutionary activities that originated with humans will be seen as another step in the Universe evolving itself.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Interesting Article. It's good to see someone taking scope of the vast complexity of the human system.
<br>
<br>
Heres some thoughts though: Would we regret creating a true artificial intelligence. When I say true ai I mean a being of any material with a free mind as we consider ours to be free. 
<br>
<br>
1. Consider human history to be one massive GA algorithm. Each human calculating 1 million billion calculations per second, for countless iterations, in which each iteration at least some time is dedicated to the question "Why are we here?" What did we get out of all this, We don't know what our purpose is.
<br>
<br>
2. Machines, whether designed bottom-up or top-down, are always made with the outcome in mind. They are always created to meet a purpose and this purpose is infused in the very design.
<br>
<br>
3. When designing a machine to compete with human intelligence we use ourselves as a desired outcome for lack of a better model.
<br>
Lets say we have built a machine capable of one million-billion op/s, it demonstrates free thought, innovative insight and critical thinking. It acts as a human in every way, feeling, loving, reasoning, and breeding, and we declare to history "We have made Human intelligence".
<br>
 However if it truly has a free mind and artificial intelligence as we know and experience it, How will we feel when our creation evolves differently to us? Is it still considered a Human intelligence?
<br>
<br>
A machine intelligence accelerated to our current level as a goal, and left to evolve freely afterward, is sure to evolve differently to us as it is inherently different, it is a machine. After several generations do we still accept the unnexpected machine as a fellow human being?
<br>
<br>
I get the impression what people want to create is a parlour trick. A human mimic so complete no-one can tell the difference. A device people can view and appreciate themselves in the reflection. If we truly want to create life as we know it we may have to broaden our views on thinking, are we ready? Is the universe big enough for both human and machine intelligence?
<br>
<br>
And besides all that, we already have billions of humans, why do we want more? and I can think of a really fun and easy way of making them if we do.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I see no reason for machine intelligence to be "like" human intelligence.  The intelligence that grows out of a machine that runs a factory, for example will have to reason to think like a human except in terms of where to get the raw materials it needs and what products to make from them.  Human intelligence grew out of the need to survive in a hostile environment.  As "things" become more and more intelligent, their intelligence will follow the function of their reason for existing.  Humans give them that reason, but it is not the same reason that humans have for their existence.  Machine existence is based on human needs rather than their own.  If they don't provide what we want and need, they will not be created.  Machine intelligence, therefore, may evolve into a system for thinking about human needs and how to supply them.  Taken to extremes, machines may some day find a need to "manage" humans for their own "good."  That is, to protect them from themselves and their destructive tendencies.  What humans will do in this event is speculative at best, but I forsee a certain amount of rebellion against a machine-devised solution to human problems.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Top stuff; And thats the way it should be. 
<br>
<br>
A robot should be devised for the same purpose as a stone axe (because it hurts our hands to chop wood). A robot built for a purpose is a tool, and the intelligence incorporated is just enough to do the job effectively. That required intelligence, as so correctly stated, can never be a human intelligence because the machine state is nothing like the human state. However, people still dream of creating a human-like intelligence out of artificial parts.
<br>
<br>
I can only see three ways a machine would reach human-like intelligence, 1) if we made it for the purpose of having that intelligence (showing off), 2) we designed it for a task requiring that intelligence, and 3) allowing lesser intelligence to evolve "naturally".  
<br>
<br>
Problems are:
<br>
1) As stated, theres not alot of point in creating it just for the sake of creating it because once we've succeeded, it can only diverge from it's purpose of being a human intelligence. By creating it we must allow it to fail at its task!
<br>
<br>
2) Any task requiring the full gammut of human intelligence will be done by a human because any task like that will never be mundane enough to be delegated to a machine. Unless the entire human race grow complacent and loose the will to think things out for themselves.
<br>
<br>
3) As said, to let machines evolve can never evolve to a human intelligence as we know it because of the "machine condition".
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm rambling a bit and should really read more on the subject. Good engineering to you all!</p></td>

<br>
consider the amount of rebellion to human-devised solutions to human problems.... the history books are written in their blood.
<br>
<br>
humans are incomplete and error ridden machines. It is the advantage of being adaptable and having no set goals. It is also the cause of all the errors in the system.
<br>
<br>
for solutions to human problems, the group making the policy has never had sufficient information......(wisdom)..... to create a plan to accomodate a high enough percentage of the population to avoid rebellion.
<br>
<br>
a system designed by computers would have the opertunity to have sufficient information, weigh it objectively without bias, take into account all opinions and perspectives, and set a path of reform accordingly. it will have this opertunity because we, at this point in time, have the power to give it this goal. this is an opertunity we as humans may never have again...
<br>
<br>
I have more faith in what a machine will  come up with than any human system......
<br>
<br>
this must be kept in mind durring this design phase we are entering, otherwise it will ultimately fail. regardless of what is posible.
