<div class="TeaserText">A look at what may replace books, written for "The Futurecast," a monthly column in the Library Journal.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Originally published February 1992. Published on KurzweilAI.net August 6, 2001.</p>
<p>It is said that in the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> we overestimate what can be accomplished in the short term and underestimate what can be accomplished in the long term. With the exception of a few prescient observers (such as <a class="thought" href="entries/babbage_entry.html">Charles Babbage</a> in the case of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>), most predictions of the 20th century overlooked such breakthroughs as the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, radio, television, and atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, not to mention such recent innovations as the laser and <a class="thought" href="entries/bioengineering_entry.html">bioengineering</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the breakthrough, it is also difficult to anticipate serendipity, the coming together of diverse trends with profound yet unanticipated effects. In the case of the book, it is the interplay of such multifarious trends that will determine its destiny. The trends themselves are not hard to anticipate, although the stunning pace of development, particularly of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>, is often not fully appreciated. In most fields, we take it for granted that things get more expensive each year. But in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> field, we can at least double functionality for the same unit cost every 12 to 15 months, and even this pace is accelerating. </p>
<p>The implications of this geometric trend can be understood by recalling the legend of the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of chess and his patron, the emperor of China. The emperor had so fallen in love with his new game, he offered the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> a reward of anything he wanted in the kingdom. </p>
<p>"Just one grain of rice on the first square, your majesty."&#160;"Just one grain of rice?"&#160;"Yes, and two on the second, four on the third, and so on." </p>
<p>The emperor immediately granted the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>'s seemingly humble request. One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt (the doubling per square ultimately equaled 18 million trillion grains of rice). The more believable version has the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> losing his head. </p>
<p>As an example of what this trend has already accomplished, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist David Waltz points out that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> today, after adjustment for <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>, costs only one-hundred-millionth of what it did in 1950 (which is consistent with a doubling of <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> every 18 months). If the automotive industry had made as much <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in the past four decades, a typical automobile today would cost about one-hundredth of a cent. </p>
<p>With the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> doubling every year in every dimension, the impact will become increasingly hard to ignore. This becomes all the more significant as computers begin to affect virtually every other area of endeavor. </p><h1>The Powerbook looms </h1><p>So let us examine how just the predictable trends will affect the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of the book. Last month, we discussed the emergence of the first wave of false pretenders to the functionality of the paper book. While the <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> book provides profound advantages in the quantity and accessibility of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, it falls short in some of the fundamental characteristics of paper and ink in the areas of flicker, contrast, resolution, and color. But as noted above, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is anything but static, and already some of these limitations are being overcome. <a class="thought" href="entries/kay_entry.html">Alan Kay</a>, senior fellow at <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>, points out that the recently introduced <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> Powerbook 170 is flicker free and has a contrast ratio of 95:1, close to paper's 120:1. <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a> is actually positioning its new <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> book and plans to provide a library of books as <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, hence the name Powerbook. </p>
<p>By next year, the first wave of color notebook computers will appear. Perhaps the most significant issue is resolution. Interestingly, the Jacquard loom, perfected by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1805, which we might regard as the world's first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> display, had a resolution of 1000 silk threads to the inch, equaling that of paper. Jacquard's loom was controlled by punched cards and foreshadowed the emergence of the punched card-based data processing industry 85 years later. Today's notebook computers have a resolution of only about 100 dots per inch (dpi), substantially less than paper. Within two to three years, however, we will see notebook computers with about 250 dpi, which for many applications will begin to rival paper and ink. </p>
<p>Let us jump ahead and describe the notebook <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that we are likely to see by the turn of the century based on readily discernible trends. Resolution will range from 500 to 1000 dpi, the same as high-quality printed documents. The displays will be flicker free and will have contrast ratios and color capabilities comparable to paper and ink. The devices will come in a variety of sizes ranging from pocket sized to double-hinged displays that will present two large pages. These computers will be thin (perhaps 1/2" deep) and lightweight. </p>
<p>By the end of this decade, the standard <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">RAM</a> chip will be one gigabit (one billion bits), so the typical personal notebook will provide at least a billion bytes (characters) of <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">random access</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. Low-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> (text, voice, still pictures) will be by <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> cellular transmission. High-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> (moving high-resolution pictures) will be by optical fiber. In my November 15, 1991 column ("<a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> in the Age of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a>," p. 60-62), I mentioned Japan's plan to install a fiber optic-based <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> superhighway into every home and office by early in the next century. President Bush recently signed a $3 billion bill to begin <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in this area, but we still lack anything comparable to Japan's multi-hundred-billion-dollar commitment. I do anticipate, however, that we will wake up sooner or later to this enormous competitive threat. </p><h1>Whatchamacallit </h1><p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> between user and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> will be through voice for entering text and a pen-like <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> for pointing and for graphical gestures such as crossing out words. The keyboard will be entering obsolescence as we enter the first decade of the next century. </p>
<p>So what is this thing? A <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>? A telephone? A television? A personal transcriptionist? A cybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> assistant? A book? </p>
<p>Obviously, it is all of the above. As a telephone, it will include realtime <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> translation (at least between certain popular languages) so that we can readily communicate with people around the globe (the <a class="thought" href="entries/translating_telephone_entry.html">translating telephone</a> capability will mature during the first decade of the next century). With the addition of a small, hand-held <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> camera, this "telephone" will also include moving high-definition pictures. </p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/gilder_entry.html">George Gilder</a> describes high-definition television - the marriage of the two great <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies of the 20th century (the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and television) as creating a highly flexible telecomputer that is interactive and intelligent. </p>
<p>As a personal <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> assistant, the <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> of our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> PCs will contain intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> navigators that have the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of where to find <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> through instantaneous <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> with increasingly comprehensive databases. </p>
<p>However, let us concentrate for a moment on its application as a book. The <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> of the early 2000s will not be a false pretender. These <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> books will have enormous advantages, with pictures that can move and interact with the user, increasingly intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> paradigms, simulated environments that the user can enter and explore, and vast quantities of accessible material. Yet vital to its ability to truly make the paper book obsolete is that the essential qualities of paper and ink will have been fully matched. The book will enter obsolescence, although because of its long <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and enormous installed base, it will linger for a couple of decades before reaching antiquity. </p><h1>The virtue of virtual books </h1><p>The paper book will be replaced by a category of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that we can call virtual books. Is the virtual book really a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> or just a continuation of the old (paper) <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> by other means? It is certainly a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in the same sense that the "horseless carriage" automobile was a different <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> from the horse and buggy. Changing such a central <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> of an old <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> opens up so many new possibilities that we can truly say that a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been born. </p>
<p>Yet haven't we been hearing about the paperless <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> for at least a decade now? American business's use of paper for printed documents increased from 850 billion pages in 1981 to nearly four trillion pages in 1990. It is certainly the case that while computers make it possible to handle documents without paper, they also greatly increase the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> of producing paper documents. Until the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> display truly rivals the qualities of paper, computers will increase the use of paper rather than replace it. But once these qualities are matched, and the requisite <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies are in place, the printed book and other paper documents along with it will begin a rapid descent into obsolescence. </p>
<p>Many people were skeptical that the compact disc (CD) would replace the phonograph record. I remember being hesitant to buy a CD player because I was attached to my extensive collection of LPs collected over a lifetime, and I did not desire it becoming obsolete. My curiosity finally drove me to acquire a CD, and then I was hooked. My CD collection has grown, but I still have several shelves in my living room filled with my old album collection. But it has now been years since I have even touched one of these old phonograph albums, and even more years since I purchased one. People are also attached to their collections of paper books, but when the truly viable <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> book comes along, which will happen by the end of the decade, resistance to it will not last long. </p><h1>Click and pick </h1><p>So how do you buy a virtual book? By going to a bookstore, obviously. Not physically of course, you simply "click" on <i>bookstore</i>. Icons then appear for different choices. So let's say we click on <i>Brentano's.</i> We now see icons for different categories of books: <i>best sellers</i>, <i>fantasy &amp; </i><i>science fiction</i>, etc. Let's click on <i>best sellers</i>. We now see images of book spines, which can be scrolled across the screen. Some books that the bookstore wishes to highlight are shown with the full front jacket. </p>
<p>Ah, here is an interesting one, <i>The Best of Futurecast</i> by <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>. We click on that, and we now see the full front and back jacket. We click on the photo of the author, and he comes alive explaining the virtues of his book. We click on the front cover, and we see the front <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. We scroll through the table of contents. Here is an interesting old article from 1992 on "The End of Books." We click on it and start reading. Hmmm, this is very interesting; <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s predictions weren't all bad! </p>
<p>Whoops, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> now tells us that if we want to continue reading, we have to acquire the book. Options are presented. We can <i>purchase</i> it, we can <i>rent</i> it, there are several other choices. Well, this is a book we will certainly want to return to over and over, so we click on purchase. Now we see icons for <i>debit to checking account</i>, <i>charge to American Express</i>, etc. Once the transaction is complete, the book is transmitted via <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> cellular <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and becomes part of the permanent <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a> of our <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. </p>
<p>What about the public library? Okay, click on <i>city library</i>. We see icons for categories. Click on <i>best sellers</i>. Now click on <i>The Best of Futurecast</i>. Looks interesting, so we click on <i>borrow book</i>. </p>
<p>Now wait a second. The library scenario sounds very similar to the bookstore scenario. Why would anyone buy a book if you can borrow it just as easily for free anytime you want to read it? </p>
<p>Other questions come to mind. What happens to that big library building? Will there still be paper books printed? Will libraries still carry these? How will the library work? What will librarians do? </p>
<p>There are reasonable answers to these questions, which we will examine next month. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is interesting to read these more than 10 year old predicitons about electronic books. The descriptions of current notebook computers were not too far off the mark.
<br>
<br>
But even the notebooks as described would never replace books. There is the obvious problem of portability and power consumption. Beyond this, one of the key benefits of printed books over any current form of electronic books is the ability to flip pages. Flipping pages is beneficial in many ways. 1) It allows for serendipidous discoveries. 2) It is much easier to find a rememebered passage in a printed book than in any electronic medium I've ever used, because we can usually remember about where it was in the book without the need to remember any specific key phrases. Electronic books have no equivalent tactile feedback. 3) It is much easier to skim through material by flipping pages.
<br>
<br>
I cannot imagine books being totally eliminated until an electronic book medium exists that is capable of displaying (at a minimum) several dozen pages at a time. When cheap and flexible e-paper becomes a reality, organized into virtual books with dozens of pages, then the printed book may truly be at an end.
